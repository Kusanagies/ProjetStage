"Infection often occurs when the immune system fails to respond optimally to invading pathogens, but exposing individuals to pathogen derived-components combined with an agent (called an adjuvant) that boosts immune responses is an effective strategy to generate robust immunity against infection. Therefore, the quest to manipulate the immune system to generate effective immunity against pathogens can be considered as the 'grand challenge' of modern immunology. An integral player orchestrating this immunity is a rare but widely distributed network of cells called dendritic cells (DC). DC, which have been called 'nature's adjuvants,' express pathogen recognition receptors to sense and respond to microbes or vaccines. Research in the last decade has shown a fundamental role for DC in initiating and controlling the quality and strength of the immune response. As such, DC represent attractive immune modulatory targets for vaccinologists and their critical role in controlling host immunity to intracellular pathogens is largely proved. However, much less is known regarding the role of DC in the immune response to extracellular bacteria, most of which are covered by a shell of sugars, known as the polysaccharide capsule (CPS), that help bacteria hide from the immune system. One such bacterium is Group B Streptococcus (GBS), a leading cause of disease and mortality in newborns in the Western hemisphere. Antibodies to CPS are crucial for protection against infection, although the nature of this response is under intense investigation. Fusion of CPS to a carrier protein enhances its ability to elicit an immune response; however, several important questions remain unsolved. In my research plan, I propose to delineate the interactions of GBS with DC to identify mechanisms by which DC can overcome the strategies used by encapsulated bacteria to evade the immune system and thus initiate a protective immune response. Data from these studies will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of the disease caused by encapsulated bacteria, thereby helping to advance the development of more potent anti-CPS vaccines. The efficacy of such vaccines will critically require optimal DC responses to generate a long-lasting, protective immunity.

"Progress in numerical technologies, as well as greater processing speed, has prompted the use of complex environmental models for research, design and planning purposes. Nowadays, powerful computer codes are available to describe nearly any environmental process of interest. As evidence for catastrophic impact of global warming grows at an alarming rate, the current practice is to use these models for impacts estimation after calibration using observed data.  However, the issue of consistency is rarely considered: will a model that is performing relatively well in the current climate provide trustworthy results in a changed climate? In hydrology, nearly all categories of models have been used, unfortunately with very little attention if any to the suitability of the chosen environmental model under future climatic conditions. Black-box models should be used with extreme caution for such studies, since it is well known that the parameters of black-box models capture a lot of information related to the calibration conditions. In this case, the implicit assumption of consistency in a watershed's response to climate does not hold.  The latter statement applies, in principle at a lesser extent, to physics-driven and conceptual models, which always involve some parameterisation and calibration. Since global warming is driving earth's climate in an unprecedented manner, insight is needed as to how a particular model can be expected to perform in the future climate. 

The objective of this proposal is to develop a general framework in which the performances of an environmental model can be monitored to track changes in parameter values or in the adequacy of the current system's mathematical description in reaction to identified environmental conditions. The developed framework will be useful to solve two different types of problems: a) a retrospective analysis of the changes in order to identify the causal anthropogenic or climatic factors; and b) to understand how the timing and magnitude of these changes can be related to the causal factors in order to increase the model's predictive ability.

"The game industry is becoming a multi-billion dollar industry with revenues overcoming those of the movie industry. The global market for games software and hardware is about $30 billion. Canada accounts for approximately 3% of these sales. Canada also possesses many development houses that are well known over the world for their game quality, e.g. BioWare, Electronic Arts, and Radical Entertainment. Technical and design achievements of this industry have found utility beyond their native industry expanding to health, education, and training; games used for these applications are often called serious games. 

   The industry is facing many challenges in several domains including management, engineering, computer science, and design. One of the current challenges is in developing intelligent algorithms that adapt narrative, visual, audio, and characters' animation to account for users' interaction. This is important because the current systems are: (a) time- and labour-intensive (requiring multi-million dollar budgets and 4-6 years of development time), (b) rigid, do not adapt well to changes in the scenes, and (3) designed based on predictions and control of timing and pacing which are not static as they depend on users' actions. This proposal focuses on developing a research program that targets this problem. 

   Since 1998 I have investigated the development of systems to resolve these problems, with many successful prototypes. The proposed work will extend my previous work by developing 1) formalized models that explain how camera and lighting can be used to communicate information, evoke emotions, and channel attention, 2) novel intelligent systems based on these models; these systems will adapt, in real-time, visual appearances, including lighting and camera behaviours, to accommodate users' interactions, and 3) authoring tools that allow developers to dictate behaviours for these systems. This work will accelerate the development process (resolving problem (a)) as well as adapt the visual design in real-time, producing flexible visual systems (resolving problems (b) and (c)).

"One of the main goals of the visual system is to recognize objects so that we may interact with them appropriately. Although recognition of people, places and things typically appears to be effortless and instantaneous, the processes underlying such recognition are complex and the visual system must undergo tremendous obstacles for recognition to occur. For example, various elements of the raw images that reach our eyes must be organized appropriately, so that we perceive coherent, meaningful, complete objects rather than inappropriately semented, confusing scenes. Given the complexity of the recognition process, it is not surprising that we have relatively little understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying recognition. The objective of the current proposal is to advance that understanding, with an emphasis on issues related to perceptual organization and object recognition.



In recent years, we have refined several psychophysical techniques that enable us to address these issues at a different level than was possible previously. The current proposal extends this work, especially with respect to the problems of visual completion, and face and pattern recognition. The current work also examines how aspects of visual perception are altered by context and learning. Although much of my work retains its focus on using behavioural techniques to make inferences about underlying neural processes, increasingly the studies take the approach of converging methodologies -- combining modern psychophysical approaches with neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonanance imaging and electroencephalography.



The results of these studies should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying perceptual organization and recognition, and the program of research provides exceptional training opportunities for HQP.","Perceptual organization and object recognition",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Sensory systems -- visual"

"In June 2007, the Federal Government selected ""Adaptive Phased Management"" as the approach for the long-term manage- ment of Canada's used nuclear fuel (high level radioactive waste). The ultimate objective of this approach is long-term central confinement and isolation of used nuclear fuel in a Deep Geological Repository in a suitable crystalline or sedimentary rock formation. The approach will be implemented by the Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO), a non-profit organization created by the Canadian nuclear electricity producers under the Nuclear Fuel Waste Act. The Deep geological Repository Approach is a method that has been adopted by most of the countries with nuclear programs. The method is being used for both high level and low and intermediate level radioactive waste.

Concurrently, Ontario Power Generation (OPG) has also submitted an application to the Canadian regulator (the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission) for developing a Deep Geological Repository beneath the Bruce Nuclear site in Kincardine, located on the shore of Lake Huron approximately 250 km northwest of Toronto. The plans are to construct the repository at a depth of about 680m within the sedimentary sequence of the Michigan Basin. Site characterization activities have already started to support the environmental assessment. The permeability of the host rock and its evolution with changes in the stress conditions is key to the effectiveness of the isolation concept. The alterations in the stress state during the construction of the repository can cause damage of the host rock, which can lead to the enhancement of the permeability characteristics of both crystalline and sedimentary rock.This proposed research will investigate the role of damage evolution in sedimentary rock on the alteration of its permeability characteristics. The research includes laboratory experimentation involving triaxial testing of large diameter cylindrical samples and large block samples. The results of the experiments will be used to develop constitu- tive models that describe permeability evolution in the rock.

"Environmental geomechanics is the key discipline for solving geoenvironmental problems that have complex interactions between mechanics, physics and chemistry, which profoundly influences the modelling of geomaterial behaviour. The underlying theme of the Discovery Grant relates to Thermo- Hydro- Mechanical- Chemical(THMC) coupling in materials and focuses on the following:(i) Chemical interfaces and their influence on the mechanics and integrity of geosynthetic barriers used in waste containment, (iii) THMC processes in geomaterials susceptible to chemical damage with applications to geologic storage of CO2, and (iii) Coupled THM processes in porous rocks with special reference to heat-induced hydraulic hysteresis in the fluid transport processes. These topics are critically important to geoenvironmental endeavours, which has an impact on human health and the environment, particularly as they relate to containment of toxic wastes derived from mine tailings and landfill, geologic sequestration of CO2 in saline aquifers and acid mine drainage and the deep geologic storage of high-level heat-emitting nuclear fuel wastes. The research involves model development, laboratory experimentation and computational modelling and can be viewed as a necessary prelude to full-scale field investigations. Computational model development and their validation by recourse to experiments is well founded in the scientific method and is vital, particularly when the alternative involves costly field scale tests that lack sufficient definition for model development. Computational approaches are necessary in view of time scales relevant to many containment strategies: e.g. the time scales of interest to nuclear waste isolation are of the order of 10,000 years, while storage and containment of leachate and toxic materials from wastes and geologic sequestration of CO2 have to be regarded as permanent. The Discovery Grant will train environmental geomechanicists with a balanced outlook on the importance (and limitations) of experimental research and sophisticated modelling, and an asset to scientific, engineering and regulatory communities in Canada and internationally.

"The availability of safe drinking water is fundamental to health. Unfortunately, the sustainability of this precious resource is under threat from several factors including population growth, environmental degradation, and the looming challenge of climate change. As water resources get increasingly stressed, ensuring safe water supply and effective water treatment becomes increasingly important. Waterborne illness is a significant public health problem in Canada and globally. According to the World Health Organization, 35% of the deaths worldwide are attributed to water-borne diseases or water contamination. Monitoring of microbiological contamination of water currently is time-consuming, laboratory based, and frequently compromises the timeliness of health advisory warnings even when contamination is found. Therefore, rapid detection of unsafe water can contribute greatly to mitigating the morbidity and mortality associated with waterborne diseases. This research program is aimed at development of innovative, scalable solutions in real-time, portable monitoring of water resources so that timely information can be obtained about the quality of water. This is critically important in small rural communities face special challenges in ensuring safe water supply and effective wastewater treatment. We will study and develop lab-on-chip solutions that are automated, low-cost and assemble disparate technologies involved in traditional lab-bench diagnostics. These include development of modules for sample concentration, sample clean-up, extraction, amplification and electrical detection technologies.

Development of these modules and assembly of such a system will eliminate the main bottleneck in the real-time monitoring of water resources. By simplifying the technical expertise required to perform diagnostics, these devices allow early detection and diagnosis of pathogens present in water. In addition, the project will provide interdisciplinary training to highly qualified personnel in engineering, microtechnology and biology.","Portable real-time water monitoring system",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical technology"

"In general, my research revolves around solving various production planning and scheduling problems with the aim of making the production process more economical and efficient. Recently my efforts have been directed towards applying theoretical results and developing solution models to recently emerged supply chain scheduling problems. Unlike traditional scheduling works, supply chain scheduling is concerned with the coordination among the entities of a supply chain. This is a macro analysis of scheduling problems in supply chains. Generally micro analysis of a system provides insight of macro system. Therefore, I am working on supply chain scheduling problems by studying scheduling problems at different entities (upstream supplier, manufacturer)  under different production conditions (push production, pull production) and then analyze scheduling problems with coordination of entities. 



Two main objectives used in my optimization models

1.    )	Minimize sum of inventory holding cost and delivery cost:  In manufacturing environments, especially when delivery costs are significant, several jobs may be delivered together in a batch. When a cost is incurred on each batch delivery, it is better to increase the batch sizes so that the delivery cost is minimized. However, the larger batch sizes will lead for longer stays in the plant and cause larger inventory costs. Therefore, a trade-off between inventory holding cost and the delivery cost is very important in supply chain scheduling. 

2.    )	Minimize total setup costs while meeting due dates: In a pull manufacturing environment, the manufacturer needs to meet the due date. If only the jobs of the same product type can be batched together, then having larger batch sizes to minimize the cost associated with setup may lead to violation of due dates. Thus we have to find a batch schedule so that the setup cost is minimized while meeting the due dates.

"Three-phase catalytic hydrogenation is one of the most environmentally acceptable reaction routes for numerous applications in the petrochemical, fine chemicals and food industries. To achieve higher product yields and minimize production costs and safety concerns, nano-, micro- and macro-levels of the catalyst design must be considered in an integrated approach in relation to the reactor design. 

The project objectives are:

i)  to develop catalytically active nanostructures with predominant exposure of active sites possessing high hydrogenation activity and selectivity (>95%) without the use of hazardous poisons; 

ii)  to produce stable arranged catalysts consisting of the developed nanostructures and arranged supports providing optimal reaction conditions for the best catalyst performance;

iii)  to design a structured semi-batch reactor with embedded arranged catalyst. 

The novelty is in establishing a structure-reactivity relationship for a structure-sensitive hydrogenation and in designing a novel structured semi-batch reactor. The project's success will lead to knowledge advancement in the field of structure-sensitive reaction fundamentals and in the area of bridging the materials gap between real catalysts and ideal systems. In the future, such catalysts with the active surface approaching model systems should replace multipurpose conventional catalysts for high value products with low output. The practical significance is that the main project deliverable will be a semi-batch structured reactor for multiphase hydrogenations in fine chemicals production. The long-term objective is to actively contribute to the early success of implementation of three-phase catalytic structured reactors in Canada and worldwide. It is believed the research results and highly qualified personnel training in this area will enable the uptake of such perspective catalytic technologies on an industrial scale.","Structured reactors for structure-sensitive catalytic reaction",Engineering,CANADA,CANADA,"Reaction fundamentals and reactor design"
"Sleep is a fundamental biological process identified in virtually in all species of animals. Of various stages of sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is unique in that the brain is active but the body is totally asleep except for rapid eye movements. REM sleep peaks towards the end of the sleep period, and this daily rhythm is known to be driven internally by the circadian (~24 hours) clock housed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain in mammals. We have recently shown that polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA NCAM), a molecule that promotes cell-to-cell interaction, plays a role in the diurnal pattern of REM sleep in rats. Specifically, a compound that removes PSA pharmacologically abolished the normal increase in REM sleep in late sleep phase. However, the route of administration was such that it would have affected the entire brain. The SCN, in fact, contains high amounts of PSA NCAM. As a next step, therefore, we will remove PSA NCAM selectively from the SCN and observe effects on REM sleep patterns. Sleep researchers have long thought that REM sleep is regulated by the interaction between REM-on and REM-off neurons in the lower part of the brain. Although the SCN clock presumably influences this on-off switch, there are no direct anatomical connections. We previously identified indirect anatomical connections of the SCN with wake and NREM sleep nuclei. We will use a similar anatomical approach to identify any indirect pathways from the SCN to REM-on and REM-off neurons. The SCN is thought to promote sleep and wake at different times of day (or night), and distinct SCN neurons are thought to influence different physiological functions. Using timed c-Fos (a neuronal activation marker), we will test the hypothesis that SCN neurons that promote REM sleep are different from those that promote wake in their location and projections. These three complementary studies using behavioural, anatomical and neurophysiological techniques will shed light on how the mammalian circadian clock controls the timing of REM sleep to achieve maximal adaptability to the periodic environment.","Neural mechanisms of REM sleep: circadian influence.","Not available",CANADA,CANADA,"Behavioural neuroscience"

"The goal of the proposed research is to find ways to further improve the photoefficiency of organic semiconductors based on polythiophenes and other conjugated polymers, in order to build efficient organic solar cells. The problem of solar energy conversion has become very important over the past few years due to major environmental concerns and high oil prices. The main material utilized in today's solar cells is silicon; however, silicon is expensive in terms of both money and energy required for its production. Organic semiconductors can be easily applied as thin films (""solar paint""); they are potentially inexpensive and feature much higher absorption coefficients in the visible range as compared to inorganic semiconductors. However, the main problem of organic materials is their low efficiency, which is currently maximum 5-6% in some advanced laboratory samples, as compared to 15% and more for commercial silicon cells. 



All practical systems researched today utilize the donor-acceptor architecture, whereby the active material of a solar cell is a combination of an electron-donating conjugated polymer and an electron acceptor. Such an architecture facilitates the dissociation of primary photoexcitons and thus greatly improves the overall cell performance. Currently the most efficient systems are polymer blends with certain fullerene derivatives. However, to be efficient, fullerene-based cells require very high loads of fullerenes and suffer from pronounced phase segregation, which severely reduces their service life; furthermore, fullerenes do not absorb visible light. Therefore, other donor-acceptor materials are required if the efficiency of organic solar cells is to be further improved. This proposal is aimed at further development of these materials, with the ultimate goal of creating prototypes of solid-state organic solar cells with efficiencies comparable or better than those of fullerene-based cells but with better spectral sensitivity and stability.

"The most fascinating and important discovery of the superstring duality revolution of the 1990's was a concrete realization of the long-conjectured duality between gauge field theory and string theory. It asserts an exact mapping between maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions and  string theory in a particular ten-dimensional spacetime geometry.  Gauge field theories will forever be an important part of physics. They are the constituents of the `Standard Model' of elementary particles and describe phenomena seen in particle physics experiments at presently accessible energy scales, some to incredible accuracy.  That these gauge fields might have an alternative description as string theories is an idea with far-reaching consequences.  At a practical level, it could yield new analytical tools which would help to better understand gauge field theories and make quantitative predictions in regimes which are inaccessible to currently known techniques.  It has already provided considerable intuition about the behavior of gauge theories in the strong coupling regime, where their non-linearities are large and the usual technique, perturbation theory cannot be applied.  This research program will study the implications of the duality betweeen gauge fields and strings, both at a formal level to better understand its structure in the one known explicit example, and at a practical level, to learn how to use it as a quantitative tool for the analysis of realistic gauge theories.   Specific projects explore the structure of AdS/CFT using highly symmetric states, the spectra of gauge theory operators using integrability and classical solutions of string theory and studies of matrix quantum mechanics using the techniques of lattice gauge theory.

"Goldenrods in the genus Solidago are very common wild flowers, often locally abundant, and occur in every province and state in Canada and the United States and in parts of Mexico, South America, Europe and Eastern Asia.  A few species have been introduced into many parts of the world and are sometimes invasive aliens.  The primary focus of the proposed research will be to complete individual studies on the morphology and biogeography of different groups of goldenrods and combine these with previous research into a book on the goldenrods of the world.  Many kinds of goldenrods are very rare; some are officially listed as threatened or endangered.  Other goldenrods are so widely distributed and abundant that they are considered to be obnoxious weeds on agricultural lands.  Goldenrods are often studied by ecologists and evolutionary biologists as models for more general questions on insect/plant relationships.  However, no detailed monographic level taxonomic treatment of the entire genus has been published. Some species have never been illustrated in detail and no detailed distribution maps are available. Existing treatments in regional floras are not consistent in reporting the numbers of species nor in how to recognize them.  The applicant has spent more than three decades investigating goldenrods, the related goldenasters, and asters and was the primary author of the treatment of Solidago for Flora North America (2006).  The proposed research will expand on this taxonomic treatment to include all goldenrods occurring outside Canada and the United States. The resulting highly illustrated monograph will provide large numbers of people with a sorely needed standard reference on goldenrods upon which regional floras and ecological and evolutionary studies can be reliably based.","Biosystematic studies on the goldenrod genus solidago and related astereae","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Taxonomy, systematics and phylogenetics"

"The human body is composed of about 200 different types of specialized cells. These specialized cell types combine in different proportions to form the various tissues found in organs such as the brain, heart, skin, liver and pancreas. Adult mammalian tissues are also known to contain a sparse population of stem cells. The role of these adult stem cells is to maintain the tissue in which they reside by replacing cells which die due to normal wear and tear, or injury. This awesome ability to regenerate any of the numerous specialized cell types found in a given tissue has lead to a rapid increase in the amount of research aimed at developing stem cell applications. Adult stem cells could be used to better understand normal development, test new pharmaceuticals, learn about aging, and develop new therapies which could improve the health and wellbeing of Canadians. However, the development of stem cell applications requires researchers to have access to an adequate supply of stem cells. Unfortunately, due to their sparse nature in adult tissues, stem cells can only be procured in very small quantities, thereby significantly hampering research efforts.

   To address this bottleneck, the focus of this proposal is the development of an engineering research program aimed at finding methods to efficiently and reproducibly generate large quantities of adult stem cells and their derivatives under controlled conditions in culture. Initial projects within this program will focus specifically on expanding three different stem cell populations: (i) cardiac stem cells which have the capacity to generate specialized cells found in the heart, (ii) synovium derived stem cells which have the capacity to generate the cells that make cartilage, and (iii) adipose derived stem cells which have the capacity to generate specialized cell types outside of their tissue of residence including neurons normally found in the nervous system and insulin producing cells found in the pancreas. The successful outcome of this research program will be an unlimited supply of adult stem cells which can be used to develop new stem cell based applications.

"In this project I plan to address two important issues in survival analysis. The first is estimation of the proportion, or testing for presence, of immune individuals (long-term survivors) in a sample where we observe some time-to-event data for each individual (for instance, time to pain-relief following a drug administration, or time to relapse following a remission; the individuals who do not exhibit relief or relapse are termed 'immune'). I propose to study the problem under different types of 'censoring' where instead of the exact time we can often only observe whether the latter is bigger or smaller than some censoring time (for instance, under 'Case-1 interval censoring' we only have the inspection times and whether or not the event in question ocurred before it (the 'current status')). Interestingly, even if we do not have the actual number of immune individuals, censoring information such as above often helps us draw valid inferences. The problem precisely is to figure out how to calculate the required proportion and its sampling variation approximately.



The second issue is inference about the 'hazard' function which gives the 'risk' of occurrence of the event in question in the immediate future given that it has not occurred so far, i.e., describes an individual's 'aging' pattern. I am interested in hazard functions with non-monotonic shapes, such as 'bathtub' (which implies an initial  decrease followed by gradual increase in risk, as for instance in machine parts following repair) or 'unimodal' (which is inverted bathtub, i.e., initial  increase followed by gradual decrease in risk, as for instance in some cancer patients following treatment). My goal here is to estimate the function when it has such shapes, or test whether it does, under different types of censoring mentioned above. 



Both the issues arise often in biostatistical studies but so far have been dealt with using parametric models mostly. Thus it is important to develop systematic nonparametric methodology that are flexible but difficult.

"One of the branches in actuarial science, called risk theory, analyzes important quantities related to the development of the surplus process of insurance companies. Such quantities are the probability of ruin, the deficit at the time of ruin, and the surplus immediately before ruin, for instance. These provide measures of the riskiness of the overall strategy of an insurance company. As a consequence, they suggest ways of improvement of the company's chances of avoiding insolvency (or ruin), as well as retaining competitive premium rates.



Most models of insurance companies' surplus postulate that premiums are received at a constant rate in time. We propose to investigate alternative approaches such as varying premiums depending on the current surplus or depending on fluctuations of financial markets.

"Children who are poor readers and spellers at the end of Grade 1 tend to remain poor readers and spellers. In addition, poor spelling ability seems to interfere with the development of composition skill. Most important, poor literacy skills jeopardize later academic success. Given that early literacy difficulties have long term consequences, it is essential to understand better how these difficulties arise. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the development of individual differences in literacy performance among French-speaking children. In contrast to transparent languages like Finnish as well as opaque languages like English, the French written language represents many aspects of morphology that are not represented phonologically. For instance, words often end with silent consonants that indicate morphological information. Consider that the plural is most often marked with a final silent -s in nouns and a silent -nt in regular verbs, and the silent final consonant in certain nouns marks the relation with derivatives such as derived verbs (e.g., chant/chanter).  Hence, the predominantly silent morphology means that children must learn how to spell words correctly without an oral reference which results in specific difficulties and may result in an increased reliance on morphological knowledge. Hence, the present proposal focuses on young children's morphological knowledge because it may play a critical role in spelling in French. A series of studies are proposed to address the relative contribution of morphological awareness, strategies, and analysis to spelling in French. The knowledge gained from this research will lead to refinements of theoretical models on literacy acquisition by specifying the role of morphology in spelling in French. In addition, the accumulated findings from the proposed research should lead to more successful intervention studies on how morphological knowledge can enhance literacy. This information is badly needed given the recent news reports that 25% of French-speaking children in Quï¿½bec are at risk of literacy failure.","Morphological knowledge and spelling acquisition","Learning and education",CANADA,CANADA,"Cognitive science -- development"

"Traditional bridge design makes use of expansion joints in conjunction with expansion bearings to accommodate superstructure movements. However, leaking expansion joints and frozen bearings are major maintenance issues. As a result, considerable interest in integral abutment (jointless) bridges has increased in Canada and USA in the past few decades. A literature search indicates that there are very limited research studies on the economical design and evaluation of the superstructure of integral bridges when subject to environmental and truck loading condition. As such, the aim of the proposed research is to contribute to the efficient design of integral bridges by developing experimentally calibrated, computer based, analytical models capable of predicting accurately their response when subjected to construction, service, and ultimate loading conditions as well as seismic excitations. It is expected that the proposed research will provide data for the design and evaluation of integral bridges in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code. Specifically, the results will lead to: (i) valuable information to advance the state-of-the-art of the structural behavior of integral abutment bridges and enrich CHBDC Chapter 5 on Analysis of Bridge Superstructure; (ii) increasing awareness on some important issues that arise during construction, as well as repair, of these bridges, leading to significant cost savings; and (iii) reliable simplified evaluation method to existing integral bridges under ultimate load condition since a small increase in strength for live load can make the difference between closing a bridge and leaving it open. This research project will train young engineers to gain a thorough understanding of this complex bridge system, and after some practical experience, will be able to contribute to Canadian Transportation infrastructure.","Structural design issues for integral abutment bridges",Engineering,CANADA,CANADA,"Structural engineering"

"Fluid power technology enjoys widespread use in a variety of applications: legged hydraulically powered walking machines, hydraulic robots, precision machine tools, flight control actuators, active suspension, motion simulators, excavator machines, and pneumatic prostheses. Traditional performance of fluid power actuators, however, no longer meets the current demands. Hydraulic manipulators are now required to perform cooperative tasks including handling a common object. Also, as an integral part of safety-critical systems such as aircraft, hydraulic actuators must maintain excellent performance even in the presence of faults. Pneumatic actuators are also in demand for new applications such as machine-mediated rehabilitation. Thus, it is essential to gain an in-dept understanding of the dynamics, and to develop advanced tools and supporting theories for robust control design and intelligent condition monitoring, of fluid power systems. 



Research will be conducted to: (i) develop fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control schemes aiming at locating, and alleviating the effects of faults that can degrade the performance of hydraulic actuators, (ii) develop controllers that allow hydraulic or pneumatic actuators to interact, individually or cooperatively, with dynamic environments, and (iii) develop new tools for control synthesis and stability analysis of highly nonlinear fluid power systems. Overall, the outcome of this research will have impact on addressing fundamental and practical issues involved in realization of full potential of fluid power technology in current and future applications. Our state-of-the-art experimental facility will ensure swift migration of our research results to industries.



Many graduate students will be involved in this research. The challenging nature of the projects to be carried out, will ensure excellent training of these students, whose new expertise will benefit fields such as aviation, robotics, manufacturing, and assistive technology.

"Numerical analysis is the area of mathematics and computer science that creates, analyzes, and implements algorithms for solving numerically the problems of continuous mathematics. Such problems occur throughout the natural and social sciences, psychology, engineering, medicine, and business. In the 21st century, the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. We use a wide variety of methods, but finite element methods are some of the most powerful methods in modern computational mathematics.

One of the prime targets of many efforts in numerical simulation is the computation of the solutions for the convection-diffusion (CD) physical phenomena which are modeled by the CD equations. These latter are our model problem in this project.



The convection-diffusion problems are of great practical importance since they arise in fluid flows, reactive flows, groundwater flows, traffic flows, two-phase flows in oil reservoirs etc. They also govern a variety of physical phenomena that appear in aeronautics, astrophysics, meteorology, semiconductors, financial modelling, and other areas. However, the numerical approximation of those problems is a major source of trouble, and no standard finite element can be used to approximate them. The weaknesses of the classical finite element methods to treat such problems, have pressed upon the attention to improve some methods and/or to develop new methods for more precise representative simulation.



For these reasons, the objectives addressed here are to improve the popular Streamline-Upwind Petrov-G method and to develop new finite element methods, in order to avoid undesirable pathologies in the approximation of the solution of the CD equations. We apply these methods to perform numerical simulations of the general convection-diffusion physical phenomena, to the semiconductor, and to traffic flow problem, etc.

"Our research program is truly multidisciplinary, cutting through many areas of basic and applied science. The projects are analytical, and physical in nature; we seek a basic, fundamental understanding of materials properties through materials characterization for specific applications. Applications include: 1) Surface coatings for better lubrication/performance; 2) Novel, ultrasensitive biosensing schemes; 3) Antibacterial surface coatings; and 4) New photonic materials. 

A major thrust of our research program is the study of conformational changes of solid support immobilized polymers, and how polymer conformation and behavior is influenced by proximity to another surface, i.e., confinement. Frequently, the structure/morphology of molecules, e.g. polymers, at interfaces between surfaces dictates the strength of the surface-surface interactions, directly impacting adhesion and friction. Our studies will lead to an understanding necessary to tailor make surface coatings with improved lubrication properties. Furthermore, we will investigate the influence of confinement on the behavior of stimuli responsive polymers. Another project will focus on developing polymer/nanoparticle hybrid thin films as ultrasensitive biosensing platforms. The ultimate goal is to develop ultrasensitive biosensors for the Alzheimer's disease biomarker amyloid derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs). We will use this sensor to study fundamental aspects of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, e.g., how the variety of different molecular weight amyloid aggregates corresponds to disease progression. The group will also focus of developing diblock copolymers as antibacterial coatings. Initial research will focus on protecting hydroxyapatite (HA) surfaces; HA is the mineral that comprises teeth. By protecting teeth, using the developed diblock copolymers, bacteria attack can be minimized, reducing the frequency of tooth decay and loss. The group will also develop approaches for asymmetric nanoparticle functionalization. The ability of the synthesized particles to self assemble into photonic materials, and the optical properties of the resultant materials will be studied.

"The proposed equipment supports multidisciplinary research programs of a number of researchers of Microsystems and Nanotechnology (MiNa) group of UBC, related to clean and sustainable energy generation, nanotechnology, biosensors and electrodes and drug-delivery. More specifically, a thermal evaporation system enclosed in a glove box requested in this proposal will allow: safe and uncontaminated handling of nanomaterials (e.g., nanowires, nanotubes, nanoparticles) and organic compounds, fabrication of test electrodes and novel device structures on developed nanocomposite materials without exposure to air, use of low work-function metals (e.g, Ca, Li, Mg) and multi-layer electrodes, and development of complex surface modification processes. These capabilities are critical to a number of research programs carried out by the applicants including: NSERC Strategic Project on transparent nanomesh electrodes for low cost photovoltaic (PV) devices, NSERC Discovery Grant for catalytic growth of nanostructures, collaborative research with US universities for development of stretchable and flexible intelligent skin with distributed sensors and actuators, development of novel catalyst support layers for low cost fuel cells, development of flexible microelectrode arrays for research on neuroprosthesis and microfluidic systems for drug-delivery. The proposed equipment is urgently needed due to the present demand and will contribute to training of a large number of students in a multidisciplinary environment.","Enclosed evaporation system for flexible nanocomposite electronics, photovoltaic and other devices","Alternative energy resources",CANADA,CANADA,"Electronic materials and components"
"The growing need for clean and sustainable energy has signified sunlight as an abundant and distributed resource. However, this resource is heavily underused, mainly due to the high cost (>$2 per watt) and the low conversion efficiency (~19% for multicrystalline silicon) of today's photovoltaic (PV) panels. To reach a retail cost parity <$1 per watt for solar energy, novel solutions are required to cut manufacturing cost and to improve efficiency of PV devices. Silicon PV panels are finished with metallic fingers that collect the current and let the sunlight reach the device through the openings, but inevitably lead to ""shadowing effects"" over ~10% of the panel area. Amorphous silicon thin film PV devices are deposited on glass coated with transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) such as indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO is expensive, brittle and can only be deposited at high temperature (250C) without compromising on conductivity and transparency. The objective of this proposal is the development of a nature-inspired multiscale mesh of nanocomposite fibres (NCFs) for replacing metallic grids and TCO electrodes of PV panels so as to reduce the cost and efficiency losses associated with this electrode. A thin (<20 nm) mesh with embedded conductive nanostructures such as nanotubes (NTs) and nanowires (NWs) can carry a high current but absorb light negligibly (>90% transmission). Novel multiscale ordering and alignment in the structure of the mesh will be used (similar to veins of a leaf) to achieve desired conductivity levels while minimizing the amount of NWs and NTs needed. The NCF mesh will be deposited by an electrospinning process that is scalable to substrates including plastic in a roll-to-roll manufacturing system. Challenges for integration of the NCF mesh with Si and thin film PV panels will be addressed to

achieve high-surface-area contacts. The proposed research will have short term impact on improving efficiency and cutting cost of well-established PV panels, and develops materials and processing technologies that will revolutionize manufacturing of future panels. This research is critical for strengthening Canadian industries in clean energy and nanotechnology and training of highly qualified personnel.","Transparent conductive mesh electrodes with multiscale ordering for efficient solar energy harvesting","Electrical energy",CANADA,CANADA,"Electronic materials and components"
"The objective of this proposal is to launch a research program on growth and characterization of one-dimensional (1-D) silicon (Si) nanowires (NWs) with the aim for assembly of novel NW devices for applications ranging from integrated circuits to photonics and flexible displays.  Vertical transistor architectures based on wrap-around gate electrodes and 1-D NW cores with ballistic transport are the preferred choice for future transistors.  The prospect of morphological engineering of electronic transport and photon interaction (e.g. diameter-dependent NW band gap) due to quantum effects has put the spotlight on NWs for photodiode, and laser applications.  In addition, NWs released from a growth substrate can be inkjet-printed, sprayed or stamped onto arbitrary substrates (including plastic, paper, or latex) to form semiconductor films and electrodes for future flexible displays.

In view of the urgent demand, this grant in conjunction with an RTI grant enables us to investigate growth, fabrication and modeling of Si NW devices.  Growth of Si NWs with controllable diameter, morphology (e.g. straight, tapered, and jagged NWs, and nano-chains), alignment, and location is the key for fabrication of nano-scale devices with specific functions.  For example, controlled use of plasma and gaseous precursors coupled with intelligent modeling of growth mechanisms can lead to uniform growth of vertically aligned Si NWs, which are invaluable for vertical wrap-around transistors, field-emission electrodes, and photo/bio-sensor arrays.  In addition, novel fabrication methods are required for cost-effective and scalable integration of morphologically-engineered NWs into electronic devices and systems.  The research program will exactly address these challenges by systematic theoretical and experimental investigation of morphology-dependent electronic properties of Si NWs and their application to novel devices.  This grant serves as the core resource for launching a unique Si NW research team, and training of students in this highly-demanded field, which targets a wide range of electronic, photonic, and bio applications.

"Three themes are proposed. The first one concerns the relationship between phonological short-term memory and learning of new language. The proposed research aims to add to our understanding of the data relating the ability to immediately repeat back relatively meaningless verbal material, for instance, digits or pronounceable pseudowords, with first language acquisition, normal progress in learning to read, and successful learning of a foreign-language. Such findings led Baddeley, Gathercole and Papagno (1998) to propose that the type of memory tapped by these tasks constitutes a language learning system. The explanation states that phonological short-term memory forms a gateway to long-term storage of language material. We explore here an alternative hypothesis that phonological short-term memory tasks provide us with a snapshot of the learning process, and that a fundamental ability underlying language learning is that of encoding well-specified phonological traces that survive the high-interference conditions in short-term memory tasks. The second theme concerns the character of phonological working memory representations and their interaction with phonological long-term knowledge. This theme is investigated in traditional list learning experiments that tap the importance of different language information (on the level of sensory features, phonology, morphology and prosody) for later retrieval. A final theme addresses the language learning process itself by attempting to develop brain measures that mark different types of learning. These are used to characterise language learning over the life span. The aim is to investigate age-dependent qualitative differences in language-learning processes. In the future, such knowledge can be used to develop better-suited teaching methods for target groups.","Phonological short-term memory and language learning in different populations",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Cognitive science -- fundamental"
"Due to government instability in countries where most of our global oil resides, we are forced to look for  alternative sources of energy. Gas hydrates are a possible solution to this crisis because of the enormous amount of stored energy they possess.  Hydrate reserves exceed conventional carbon reserves and mostly contain natural gas, the cleanest burning of all available fossil fuels. They are also being viewed as a potential method for removing harmful carbon dioxide emissions from thermal power plants in order to abide by the Kyoto protocol.  The proposed research program will attempt to provide necessary information for the design of safe, economical, and environmentally acceptable processes and facilities to deal with hydrate-forming systems, and for the exploitation of in-situ methane hydrate as a future energy resource.  The outcome of such work has the potential to place Canada at the forefront of technology related to the recovery, storage and transportation of natural gas trapped in hydrate form as well as carbon dioxide emissions capture and storage. The work will primarily be performed on methane and carbon dioxide hydrates  and can be broken down into phase equilibria, morphology and kinetics studies of these hydrate systems.

"The Province of Ontario has recently identified Wellington County as an area to focus urban growth in southern Ontario under the ""Places to Grow"" initiative. As a consequence, the combined population of the City of Guelph and Wellington County is projected to increase rapidly by 85,000 people to a population of >280,000. This unprecedented rate of growth will not only strain water and wastewater infrastructure, it is likely that the primary receiver in Wellington County, the Speed River, may not have sufficient assimilative capacity to receive the additional wastewater effluent without the risk of serious environmental degradation. This proposal is a proactive research initiative to evaluate tissue and whole organism responses associated with exposure to emerging contaminants in wastewater discharges in fish communities adjacent the City of Guelph Wastewater Treatment Plant on the Speed River. We propose a two year plan to explore the spatial and temporal responses in fish communities exposed to Guelph wastewater effluent through multi-season field assessments regularly sampling impacted and reference fish communities. This plan will also monitor physiological and reproductive changes in a sentinel species (greenside darter, Etheostoma blennioides), one of the most  ubiquitous members of the Speed River fish community. These field studies are supplemented by controlled cage/lab experiments which will evaluate both the mechanism behind population and community-level changes in wild fish, and establish exposure thresholds for endocrine disruption in wastewater effluent. As bioactive compounds found in wastewater effluents are anticipated to be an emerging issue with increasing urban densities, the proposed study is expected to form the basis for future research integrating remedial action and evaluating the efficacy of wastewater treatment for the protection of aquatic ecosystems. While the results of this research are of immediate relevance to the City of Guelph and other researchers working on this water body, information gleaned from this project is also directly applicable to other studies investigating the impacts of intensive urban development on Canadian inland water systems.

"Hospitals are demanding Wireless networks in order to reliably access/transfer information to/from the point-of-care, allowing healthcare professionals to make faster decisions and diagnosis.  In warehouses, homes, office, etc., information, products and documents need to be distributed and tracked. The objective of this project is to develop an asymmetric wireless network experimental system with centralized processing and distributed access points that provide wireless service to picocells (cluster of room, etc.) using Bluetooth devices and sensors. Access points are fitted with multiple antennas (MIMO) and are connected to the processing centre via optical fibers or cables. The access points are generic (non-standard specific) and therefore enables the network to support other standards such as IEEE 802.xx. Signals on the reverse links are down converted, amplified and sampled at the access point, and transmitted to the processing centre where the bulk of the processing is done according to signal format or standard. On the forward link, signalling format such as modulation, error correction coding, space time coding, beamforming, encryption, etc. are generated at the processing centre and transmitted to the access points. Optical fibers or cables provide the wide bandwidth required for data transfer to/from the access point. This asymmetric configuration provides numerous opportunities. The access points need not be replaced as standards evolve. There is more flexibility with respect to processing power requirement, ease of signal format or antenna reconfiguration and security processing.  The test bed is, therefore, useful for multi-standard operation and for testing new standards and algorithms. Novel, low complexity, low power MIMO processing algorithms will be developed to improve transmission rate, co-existence with other wireless systems and user capacity. These solutions will lead to a new design of local/personal area networks and multi-standard access points that will significantly impact, for example, how Canadian healthcare professionals handle and share patient inormation for speedy diagnosis and treatment.  Other Canadian services that will benefit are warehouses, offices, schools etc.

"STPs are a significant source of environmental loading for many organic contaminants of historical and emerging concern.  These loadings, which may be in the form of sludge applied as biosolids on agricultural land or as final effluent discharged into receiving water bodies, directly affect toxic chemical dose of humans and the environment through various routes of exposure. The health concerns associated with these contaminants include (but not limited to) possible bioaccumulation in the food chain, non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health effects, and potential for endocrine disruption.  As in other aquatic environments, organic matter (solid and dissolved) plays an important role in controlling the fate of organic contaminants during the sewage treatment process, and the resulting environment loadings.  However, the role of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in contaminant fate during the process is poorly understood.  This project is aimed at characterizing the  DOC present in municipal sewage and quantifying the role it plays in altering contaminant fate during the treatment process.  Better understanding of the fate and transport of contaminants during the STP process, as envisaged in this proposal, will significantly impact human and environmental exposure to toxic organic contaminants through better process control of the sewage treatment process, resulting in reduced environmental loadings.  Improved knowledge of contaminant partitioning to various forms of organic matter should also lead to the development of new strategies, process options, and identify data gaps for dealing with all organic contaminants, including the ""modern"" more polar ones. The results are also expected to help the scientific community in better understanding the role of DOC in contaminant dynamics in various other environmental matrices, such as natural waters, soils and sediments.

"Radiation therapy makes use of ionizing radiation to destroy malignant cancerous tissues. The 

success of a radiation treatment depends in part on the degree of accuracy to which the prescribed radiation dose (energy deposited per unit mass) can be delivered to the tumour. One generally assumes that the dose in the tumour needs to be accurate to within ï¿½5% for a treatment to be effective. The first step involved in determining the dose to the tumour, is the measurement of the output of the irradiating device, which is, for many types of treatments a linear accelerator but is sometimes also a radioactive source. What is being determined at first is the dose at a specific reference depth in water, because the properties of human tissue with regard to radiation energy deposition are almost identical to water. In further steps, algorithms are being used to calculate dose in the patient at all points of interest based on this measured dose in water and based on anatomical information of the patient in particular. Our research aims to improve the accuracy of dose determination for radiation treatments that are composed of many small radiation fields. Knowing the dose accurately in such combined irradiations is very complex since the individual fields have different intensity. We have developed a special instrument, called a water calorimeter, which measures dose in water directly, by measuring the temperature rise at the point in water for different types of radiation used in the clinic. Since we believe that, with this method, we can measure the dose in different beams to an accuracy of better than 0.5%, we can also calibrate and study the performance of other dosimeter devices which are more easy to operate but whose characteristics are, at this point, only known from calculations. The overall long term effect of better accuracy of clinical dosimetry is better outcome of radiation therapy.","Accurate reference dosimetry of non-standard beams using water calorimetry, ionization chambers and Monte Carlo dose calculations","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Biological and Medical Physics"

"The objectives of the proposed research project are: (1) to use numerical techniques to compute, accurate to second-order-terms in the ellipticity of the equipotential surfaces, the frequencies of the Earth's normal modes, especially those of wobble and nutation for which observed frequencies are known; (2) to study the effects of elliptical instability on the viscous coupling between the Earth's fluid core and the inner core and mantle; we also plan to study the role of the elliptical instability on the planetary magneto dynamo; (3) to use experimental techniques to study the wave number one modes of a fluid shell proportional to the Earth's fluid core. These will improve the accuracy of the predicted frequencies of these modes and, therefore, help improve our knowledge of the Earth's deep interior properties. This, in turn, will help better predict the future state and behaviour of our planet.

The conventional approach to the normal mode theory suffers from two major shortcomings: (a) it is accurate to first order in the ellipticity of the equipotential surfaces, and (b) the heavy truncation of the coupled chains of ODEs resulting from the expansion of dependent variables in series of spherical harmonics makes it impossible, for almost the entire spectrum, to check the convergence of the results. This is particularly a problem in the fluid outer core where severely truncated series are unlikely to satisfactorily represent the complicated geometry of the eigenfunctions of long-period modes. In order to minimize the effects of these shortcomings we have developed a new approach in which the number of equations is reduced to three and, with the application of a Galerkin method, the order of the ODEs is reduced to one. We have used this approach to compute the periods of some of the long period core modes. We plan to extend our approach to the Earth's nutation modes. This is an important step as in recent years, with the help of very-long-baseline radio interferometers (VLBI), the accuracy of the observed periods of these modes has improved significantly. Therefore, the theory needs also be revised in order to better present the physics of the interior of our planet.

"The explosive growth of wireless and Internet technologies have facilitated the transmission of information data, and created an increasing demand for new family of sensors and antennas, to detect and monitor various phenomena, and communicate the results. Simultaneously, the progress in a number of scientific and technological areas shows promise for development and implementations of new design concepts. One important area deals with the simulated materials, where conventional materials, like conductors and dielectrics, are used to develop novel materials with new properties and superior performances. Examples are the photonic and electromagnetic crystals with band gap structures, metamaterials with negative constitutive parameters and resonant surfaces with artificial magnetic and impedance properties. Their utilization is causing revolutionary impact in hardware design. However, the realization of their full potential, especially in control of their properties, depends heavily on the fabrication and implementation concepts using MEM and nano-technologies. This project proposal is aimed at addressing such issues. We propose to develop active and/or smart surfaces, where their properties can be changed during operation, from being reflective to becoming absorptive or transparent, when illuminated by a spectrum of electromagnetic wave. There are unlimited applications for such adaptive surfaces, and in this project we will emphasize the microwave and millimeter wave bands. In the near-field zone they will be designed to behave as an electric, a magnetic or an impedance surface, and controlled using electrostatic actuated membranes. These active surfaces will be designed as matrix like structures to facilitate the control of their properties at small cell or pixel level. Applications for developing novel sensors, antennas, signal processing surfaces, and elimination of blockage effects will be considered, designed and studied.

"Basic control has matured to the point where many advanced control algorithms are now standard products in most DCS systems. For many critical loops it is desired to obtain the highest level of control performance given a specific type of control strategy, e.g. Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) or Model-based Predictive Control (MPC). Such fundamental limits to control performance are due to specific process, actuator and sensor characteristics and can be expressed in terms of the bounds due to Bode's integral theorem on the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions. An understanding of these types of factors and their impact on the performance that can be attained with a 'well designed' controller are important factors and can most easily be described if the process model is known. 



Therefore the specific focus of this research proposal will be to explore the limits of control performance from a model-based perspective, unlike the historical data-based perspective. The data-based performance monitoring approach is now well established and its focus has been on computing performance metrics from routine process data and comparing them to a benchmark, for example the minimum variance benchmark or other used-specified benchmarks.  The topic of the best achievable control given some knowledge of the process dynamics and controller type, for example a PI(D) controller, will be the main focus of this research proposal.



Over 90% of the controllers used in industry are (PID) type and yet the issue of the best achievable PI(D) control for a given class of first order plus time-delay or a second order plus time-delay process is an open problem. This proposal is to explore these fundamental limitations of PI(D) controllers when applied to the most common industrial processes.

"The explosive growth of communication demands in recent years has attracted special attention to the issue of reliability of telecommunications infrastructure and backbone networks. The importance of large-scale failure problems in communication networks cannot be overstated. Such failures could paralyze the backbone networks and completely disrupt essential network-based voice and data services across the country. Fast and cost-efficient recovery of communication service is essential in today's world. A number of different options for network restoration exist, including local (link-based) restoration or end-to-end (path-based) protection, using shared or dedicated capacity, offering different restoration times and redundancy costs. 



The main objectives of this research proposal are to analyze the impact of large scale failure scenarios arising from security attacks or natural disasters on the telecommunication infrastructure, and to design multi-layer restoration schemes, methods and algorithms for integrated protection and traffic restoration of access, metropolitan and backbone layers of the network. Survivable topology design, cost analysis, and administrative and management issues related to large-scale failure recovery in the communication infrastructure are among the topics that will be tackled in the proposed research program.

"This proposal considers the problem of synchronization and channel estimation for turbo multiuser detection (MUD) in CDMA systems operating over multipath fading channels. 

The aim of this project is to investigate using the estimated synchronization and channel parameters in a manner motivated by the general turbo principle. Specifically, we consider the synchronization unit to be another decoder, which will be employed in a turbo scheme. Instead of passing a synchronized signal, the synchronizer passes extrinsic information for each of the coded bits to the next stage. 

Finally, in this project we propose a receiver structure that takes all the necessary signal processing operations into account simultaneously. In other words, the proposed iterative receiver can jointly perform synchronization, channel estimation, channel equalization, blind/group-blind MUD, and channel decoding. The  proposed  iterative (turbo)  processing  approach  allows  earlier  stages  (or submodules) of a receiver (e.g. the synchronizer and the channel estimator) to refine their processing based on soft information obtained from later stages (e.g., the channel decoder) to provide a refine estimate of some signal parameters. 

The expected results in this work are as follows: the applicant and his research group can develop a mathematical framework for the design of turbo receivers that can perform jointly synchronization and channel estimation with muliuser detection according to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm or the space alternating generalized expectation and maximization (SAGE) algorithm.

The performance of the proposed turbo receivers can be expected to be much better than that of the conventional (or non-iterative) receivers but very close to that of the ideal receiver which assumes perfect knowledge of synchronization and channel parameters as well as all the signatures of active users in the system.

"Researchers in the fields of optical sciences and microwaves have dubbed the terms Photonic Bandgap (PBG) and Electromagnetic Bandgap (EBG) to signify structures that inhibit the propagation of electromagnetic waves at certain frequency bands.  Such structures have been the subject of intense research in the past few years. The EBG technology has thus far been widely applied in optical applications such as: guiding, dispersion engineering, self-collimation, wavelength multiplexing, negative refraction, and etc. At the core of this proposal lies the development of a theoretical basis and novel practical schemes for the utilization of EBG concepts in the construction of EBG-based phased-array antennas which are antenna systems that consist in multiple antenna elements. The upward frequency shift of emerging applications and the general trend of integration of antennas into RF circuitry strongly justify the necessity of the proposed investigation.



The achievements of the proposed research will impact the wireless industry, as the various standards and operating conditions will then be handled by a single platform. The findings and incremental knowledge base acquired as a result of this project will be used to come up with novel applications of EBG concepts in RF applications. This will provide many economic benefits to the Canadian telecom industry, and to the end users.  It is anticipated that the principles developed herein can be transferred to other disciplines and related industries such as automotive radar systems, direction finding and military applications.

"1) Enhanced context aware with agents, WSN and RFID

Entities, ranging from any kind of objects to users, are equipped with WSN and RFID tags as the means for gathering their context information. The integration of agents, WSN technology and RFID that provides unique identifiers explores a new technical horizon leveraging the simultaneous ID and sensor data manipulation intelligently. Our aim is to investigate how to simplify and enable on-demand access to RFID stored information and integrate it with the information sensed about the environment to enable identity and context aware applications, also to enhance WSN efficient algorithms with RFID. Our research will lead to efficient, intelligent and cost-effective context aware services, which would involve integrating agents, WSN and RFID. The outcome of this research will improve the quality of health care such as medication error reduction and also provide merit to applications such as accurate location tracking and condition monitoring of products. 



2) Intelligent calendaring management system 

Despite the widespread adoption of calendar or schedule management software applications, they still require significant user input, especially when users are attempting to schedule group meetings. One of the main challenges associated with this application relates to conflict resolution. The aim of this research is to significantly enhance the calendaring experience by developing an agent-based software application that will automatically and autonomously (with built-in user control) book meetings on behalf of meeting originators and participants. The ultimate goal of this research is to bridge the gap between all calendaring applications. Agents do not override user preferences or book meetings before the user has authorized the agent's decision.

"Characterization of paving materials has a central role in the implementation of mechanistic-empirical design methods. Characterization encompasses the suite of laboratory and in-situ tests and fundamental material models required to fully reproduce the material response at the various loading and environmental conditions. Moisture effects can be observed in bound and unbound layers of asphalt and concrete pavements. The scope of this proposal is limited to asphalt concrete materials of the predominant types used in Manitoba and the prairie region. 



Moisture damage is a primary mode of distress which accelerates structural degradation of pavements. Moisture reduces the stiffness of certain binders through diffusion and degrades the bond between the mastic and aggregate particles. The identification of the damage mechanisms of asphalt concrete in the presence of water is difficult. A promising approach is to identify fundamental material properties of the compacted mixtures that are impacted by moisture damage and then compare these properties before and after moisture conditioning.



This proposal identifies the need to develop a rational and practical test method, particularly one that takes into account Canadian traffic volumes and climates. The research is motivated by the opportunity to use advanced characterization methods (dynamic modulus, resilient modulus and several environmental conditioning methods) to improve the understanding of moisture damage mechanisms and to analyze mitigation strategies.

It is also an innovative framework for the integrated modelling of other travel choices. Currently, MILATRAS is restricted to the transit assignment problem only. The proposed research program consists of 2 components. In the first component, we will develop a ""mode shift"" model within the framework of MILATRAS.

"Skolem-Langford type sequences are generalizations of Skolem sequences. ASkolem sequence is a sequence of pairs of numbers from 1 to n, such that the 1s are one position apart, the 2s are 2 positions apart, etc. For  example, 3,5,2,3,2,4,5,1,1,4 is a Skolem sequence of order n=5. This concept which was discovered by Skolem is closely related to important mathematical concepts such as the golden ratio, Steiner triple systems and difference number sets.

Skolem-Langford type sequences also help

as research tools that serve several branches in combinatorics, cyclic designs, mandatory representation designs and graph factorizations. 

Recently, applications of Skolem-Langford sequences were used to construct statistical

experiments and optical orthogonal codes.

We intend to work on proving several open conjectures concerning in these sequences (near-extended Skolem...) and several applications of these sequences. 



We also planning to generalize results in  packing and covering designs. These generalizations are important to statistical designs of experiments and the creation of perfect insertion/deletion  error correcting codes which, in turn, important for the development of methods to recover DNA sequences from error.

"I propose to investigate problems combining aspects of theoretical computer science, combinatorics, algebra, and number theory, along the lines of the topics in my recent monograph with Jean-Paul Allouche, ""Automatic Sequences:  Theory, Applications, Generalizations"", published by Cambridge University Press in 2003.  In particular, I plan to work on problems involving the topics of descriptional complexity, conbinatorics on words, formal languages, and finite automata.



In descriptional complexity, we are concerned with how succinctly objects can be described (as opposed to the resource consumption of algorithms, which is the domain of computational complexity).   The techniques used in this area are taken from algebra, number theory, and combinatorics, and problems frequently make use of deep results in these areas.



Combinatorics on words is concerned with the properties of strings of symbols.    For example, given two words, when do they ""commute"" (that is, read the same no matter which word is taken first)?   Although of interest in its own right, recently there are also some applications to cryptography, where it is used in constructing hash functions resistant to certain kinds of attacks.



Formal languages is the study of the mathematical properties of languages, which are sets of words.  This area is of particular interest because of applications to parsing and compiling.



Finite automata are simple models of computation.  By studying the properties of these simple models, we hope to gain deeper insight into the nature of what can and cannot be computed.

"To unravel the mystery of the behaviour of materials on the electronic level is the central theme of the proposed research. Of particular interest is materials of the size of one thousandth of a human hair, commonly known as nanoscaled materials or simply nanostructures. This research area has generated a great deal of excitement in recent years partly because of their many peculiar properties, which deviate significantly from their bulk counter parts and partly and more importantly because of the advent of nanotechnology fueled by the idea of miniature, and discoveries and innovations based on the unusual properties of nanostructures. 

Our proposed research centers on designed synthesis, assembly and characterization of nanowires/nanotubes of semiconductors such as elemental carbon, silicon and germanium, compound semiconductors, CdS, CdSe, ZnO, SnO2, GeO2, among others as well as heterostructures, i.e. assembly of more than one type of nanostructures. We focus on the optical/transport properties and surface chemistry of nanostructures. The former has profound implications to light emitting/sensor device applications, the latter can lead to catalyst design for a large number of energy related applications such as hydrogen storage, battery, fuel cell, capacitors etc. since nanowire assembly anchored on a conducting substrate provides an enormous surface area for catalyst support and enhances electrochemical processes.

The most important tool in our research in understanding the behavior of materials in general and nanomaterials in particular is the synchrotron light source, an accelerator based light bulb that is brighter than the sun. Synchrotron light is generated when electrons are circulating in an orbit close to the speed of light. We have been involved in developing synchrotron light source capabilities at the Canadian Light Source (CLS) in Saskatoon, the only national laboratory of this kind commissioned in 2004. We will continue to utilize and develop advanced capabilities at CLS for the investigation of nanomaterials through investigations of the interaction of synchrotron light with matter via absorption and scattering processes.

"This project aims to explore how external loading on the limbs during a variety of repetitive physical activities translates to internal load levels in major joints and muscles of these extremities. The information obtained will guide future design and engineering of equipment meant to increase human performance efficiency and to reduce physical injuries such as Overuse Syndrome. Specifically, our objectives are to quantitatively determine the effects of a) load intensity, b) load time, c) load pattern, and d) posture on internal load levels of the arms and legs. Soft tissue injuries (vocational or recreational) affect a significant portion of Canada's population, creating both health and social problems. Due to our lack of understanding of biomechanics, much of the professional equipment designed for biological enhancement of repetitive physical capabilities leaves much to be desired. This research aims to reduce the level of repetitive injuries by improving personal awareness and the ergonomic design of equipment. A synchronized test unit (3D motion capture, force measurement & EMG) will be applied. Motion capture supplies quantitative kinematic description of a subject's movement. Force measurements provide the interaction between the human body and the contact surface. These data serve as input for a biomechanical model, which determines the internal loads on joints and muscles. EMG captures muscle activity, providing information on the timing of muscle group coordination and neural control. The novelty of the research lies in the external loading conditions. It will be the first time that internal loads during violin versus viola performances are contrasted. Such a comparison is highly desirable for equipment design because the 2 instruments are identical in both form and performance techniques; the only difference is their size. Thus the comparison will provide a clear conclusion on the effect of size on internal loading. For lower extremities, we will be using a newly developed forward-and-backward-pedaling-power-generation bicycle (designed by PI) that generates forward-power for the bike irrespective of the pedaling direction. It provides a rare opportunity to explore the effects of combinations of forward & backward pedaling and future bike design.

"Before a spacecraft system/subsystem being sent to its orbit, sufficient ground tests must be done to make sure it will be working properly and effectively in space.

Currently, most optical telescope tests are conducted manually that are time-consuming and cost-consuming. This research project is to develop an automated assembly integration and test (AAIT) system for NEOSSat's optical telescope.

"Active vibration control is a crucial issue for modern flexible spacecraft because the flexible dynamics may interact with the attitude/orbit dynamics, which makes high-precision attitude/orbit control more difficult. To address this issue, a strategy that combines modified input shaping technique and adaptive positive position feedback is proposed to control vibration of flexible spacecraft. Modified input shaping will be integrated with spacecraft actuators, momentum wheels and jet thrusters, to suppress several low-order vibration modes, while adaptive positive position feedback will be applied to piezoelectric smart actuators to control the dominant high-order vibration modes. The research work will be conducted as follows. Firstly, the basic principles of modified input shaping will be investigated and an adaptive algorithm will be developed for automatic tuning of parameters of the positive position feedback filters. Secondly, a detailed 3-axis dynamic model for flexible spacecraft will be developed based on flexible multi-body dynamics. The actuator configuration problem will be studied and the optimal configuration will be determined. Thirdly, the hybrid vibration controller that combines modified input shaping and adaptive positive position feedback will be developed. Method will also be developed to minimize the interaction of these two vibration controllers. The stability of the hybrid vibration controller will be proved through stability theory. Different spacecraft on-orbit operation modes will be considered as well. Then, numerical simulation will be conducted using MATLAB/Simulink to validate the theoretical analysis. Finally, hardware experiments will be conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed vibration control strategy. By using the proposed strategy, it is expected that the flexible vibration of spacecraft can be suppressed to an allowable level quickly so that high-precision attitude/pointing control can be achieved.

"In industry, distributed parameter systems are widespread. Many high performance control methods have been proposed for distributed parameter systems but most have not been able to be applied in practice. However, high fidelity models are necessary to promote advanced control methods to industrial applications. This research program proposes to develop identification techniques using empirical data so that distributed parameter models for industrial systems can be obtained with high accuracy. 



State space models have been one of the most preferred model forms in system engineering. 2-dimensional state space models that can be used to represent distributed parameter systems were proposed in the 1970's and have interested many researchers since. Identification of 2-dimensional state space models has been considered a very challenging topic and only limited results are available. In this research program, it is proposed to explore 2-D discrete state space models and the identification techniques of the model forms. Methods for extending the subspace identification methods available for lumped parameter systems to distributed parameter systems will be investigated. It is expected that the identification methods from this research program will generate high fidelity models for distributed parameter systems for process industries, and will help to promote application of distributed parameter control techniques.

"CDS is a novel rheo-casting process to facilitate the net shaped castings of Al based wrought and cast alloys by Controlled Diffusion Solidification.  The objectives of the first phase of this project were achieved and the knowledge base for the mechanisms involved in CDS and the control required on the processing parameters have been successfully developed. CDS as a process has also attracted significant interest from the automotive sector and specific projects to develop novel alloys for automotive parts have been initiated. The proposed second phase of this project will pursue the development of specific alloy chemistries and the process parameters required to process these alloys. Specific aluminum wrought alloys from the 2xxx, 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, 6xxx and 7xxx alloy series will be developed for the the CDS process and cast into net shaped components and their mechanical and performance properties quantified. Two main processes will be used for this study: high pressure/squeeze die casting and tilt pour permanent mould casting. The process parameters identified as critical in the first phase of this project are melt superheats for the two precursor alloys, mass ratio of mixing, rate of pour of second alloy into the first alloy, wait time prior to casting the mixed alloy, mould pre-heat temperature. Each final desired alloy chemistry has a specific windows of operation for each and every process parameter mentioned above. The objectives of the proposed research program include the design and development of individual precursor alloys and optimize the above mentioned process parameters. The alloys being developed are specifically from 2xxx, 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, 6xxx and 7xxx families of Al wrought alloys. The specific tasks are to quantify the effect of pouring method and rate of second alloy on the resultant microstructure and properties, optimize process conditions for high pressure/Squeeze die casting and tilt pour permanent mould casting processes for CDS, develop a guide book to present the specific detailed instructions on the procedure to cast various alloys by CDS, and evaluate mechanical properties such as Tensile, Fatigue, Creep and Wear for all the alloys being cast.

"For years, processor designers were able to fully leverage Moore's Law, which states that the density of components integrated on a single chip grows exponentially over time.  In conjunction with increasing chip density, chip clock rates have previously been following a trend of doubling  approximately every 18 months.  However, due to the increasing power requirements of processors, this clock frequency scaling is no longer possible.  Instead, processor manufacturers have moved to designing multi-core processor systems, increasing possible parallelism instead to leverage the increasing chip density while clock rates remain relatively constant.  It is predicted that the number of processors in multi-core systems will eventually scale to the 10s and 100s.  This becomes a significant challenge for the Operating System (OS), which has to determine how to schedule tasks effectively on these complex systems.  How will the OS determine how to schedule threads so as to minimize cache contention and which processor(s) meet each task's execution requirements on heterogeneous systems?  Currently a number of hardware counters are included as part of a processor's architecture that enable limited profiling of applications at run time.  However, these do not provide sufficient flexibility or information to effectively guide the OS in task assignment.  While existing counters report the symptoms of a problem (i.e., how large the cache miss rate is), they do not provide insight into why the problem has occurred and how it could be fixed. The proposed profiling core will provide both operating systems and applications with detailed information about run time performance bottlenecks and will enable them to address these bottlenecks via scheduling or dynamic compilation. As a result, application software will be able to better leverage the intrinsic nature of the multi-core hardware platform, be it homogeneous or heterogeneous. Furthermore, the profiling functionality will be isolated on a separate core, and this will facilitate inclusion of rich profiling functionality into new processors via IP reuse. This research project has the potential to significantly improve a customer's experience and productivity when used in conjunction with commercial multi-core processors.

"Emerging areas such as bioinformatics, geothermal modelling, environmental applications, and modern data visualization platforms require significant computing resources.  Existing computing systems do not support these applications well; compared to traditional applications, these new applications have unique data and processing requirements.  Scaling the processor's speed, or even using two processors on one chip, provides more computational power, but not enough to support many of these emerging applications.   This can lead to computer processing times on the order of weeks for researchers to obtain the desired data.



However, if the designer optimizes the processor's architecture for a given application (or class of applications), creating an application-specific processor, sufficient computing power can be provided.  Creating an application-specific computing platform is a time-consuming task, even for an expert in the design of computing systems.  Thus, the proposed research explores application-specific computing system architectures and programming paradigms that work in concert to abstract low-level details from programmers.  Ideally, designers should easily be able to include application-specific components that accelerate the computations for their application.  Computing system components should be optimized for performance/power/area, while the programmer remains unaware of these low-level design issues.  Achieving this objective would be significant as it could reduce the design time of new computing systems.

"Concrete blocks are widely used in buildings for foundation and partition walls. In comparison to cast-in-place concrete, masonry block structures represent a low environmental impact construction system. It consumes less material, produces lower emissions and offers better insulation. Manufacturing of concrete blocks has the potential to go even greener through an early age carbonation process, an accelerated curing technique that utilizes carbon dioxide as the curing agent in place of steam and converts gaseous CO2 into solid calcium carbonates. For the same volume of concrete, the carbonation process requires 50-90% less energy than steam and the reaction itself is a CO2 sequestration process. The combined benefits of the process significantly reduce the carbon footprint and make it possible to reach a state of zero emission. The proposed research aims to investigate the possibility of using carbonation technology to manufacture concrete blocks and establish a

network for profitable operation. A wet dynamic CO2 system will be developed to facilitate reaction under ambient conditions and an innovative mix design with calcite seeding technology will be formulated to promote reaction. The CO2 system will be built into a portable model kiln that will be situated next to a block production line in order to conduct full size block carbonation and allow comparison of performance and energy use with steam curing. To enhance CO2 uptake capacity by blocks and reduce the use of natural aggregates, calcium rich industrial wastes (such as slag and waste cement) will be treated by flue gas carbonation to examine their capacities to absorb CO2 and their quality for the replacement of natural stone. With both aggregates and their concrete blocks carbonated, it is estimated that one 18 kg block can sequester 1.31 kg of CO2. At this rate, the block industry in the US and Canada as a whole could collectively sequester 4.4 Mt of CO2 per year. A network model will be established to investigate whether both sides of the network, CO2 sources (such as power plants) and CO2 sinks (such as block plants), can profit from network operations. Durability of carbonated concrete blocks is expected to improve and will be thoroughly evaluated.","Manufacturing of green concrete blocks using carbonation process","Manufacturing processes and products",CANADA,CANADA,"Structural materials"
"The proposed research will study fundamental science on timely controlled precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) technology for carbonation induced hydration and its associated CO2 sequestration in concrete for combined environmental, technical and economical benefits. A significant fraction of the CO2 discharged to the atmosphere comes from point sources. Finding commercial uses of as-captured or recovered CO2 at point sources is critical to greenhouse gas emissions reduction. One of the promising approaches is to sequester carbon dioxide in concrete through their productions. Research at McGill University has shown that approximately 1.8 million tones of CO2 can be sequestered annually in concrete products such as blocks, pavers, cement boards and fibreboards, if all four products in US and Canada are carbonation treated. It reduces CO2 emission from cement industry by 2.6%. It is significant but still modest. To further enhance the sequestration capacity by concrete, higher reaction efficiency and more products of niche applications should be explored. The proposed research will focus on carbonation of general use concrete at early ages to establish a process in which carbonation and hydration can occur sequentially to sequester sufficient carbon while maintaining hydration features. The objectives are (1) to understand the mechanism of PCC formation at early age (0.5 to 24 hours), (2) to quantify CO2 uptake by carbonation at different ages, (3) to investigate the advantages of having PCC in concrete, (4) to develop pressurized and vacuum PCC technology using recovered CO2 and flue gas, (5) to fabricate concrete pipes by carbonation for carbon uptake and sulfate resistance, (6) to perform controlled carbonation to precast concrete for carbon uptake and alkali silica reaction (ASR) reduction, (7) to perform strong carbonation to precast concrete reinforced by GFRP rebar for carbon uptake and durability, (8) to develop a vacuum carbonation for cast-in-place concrete for carbon uptake and fast setting. The proposed carbon sequestration technology is sustainable because it is an integrated part of economy and can be used anywhere worldwide for decades to come.","The role of timely controlled PCC in concrete performance development","Structural engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Structural materials"

"We propose a multi-faceted research program based on our proven capabilities in the field of coherent-control. We wish  to produce ultracold molecules and control both inter- and the intra-molecular dynamics of diatomic and polyatomic molecules. Due to their sluggish motion, ultracold molecules behave more like waves than particles, thus forming an ideal target for exercising coherent control, a field capitalizing on quantum interferences between matter waves in order to manipulate chemical reactions by lasers. The proposal has two major objectives: (i) To lay the foundations for the new research field of ""Ultracold Coherent Chemistry"". As part of our activities in this  field we intend to study the production of ultracold molecules via the coherent photoassociation of laser-cooled atoms (first suggested by us in 1997) . Once produced, due to their long matter waves, the laser-induced manipulation of collisions and reactions between ultracold molecules becomes possible . (ii) To link the above studies to the development of new quantum mechanical tools for controlling the the internal dynamics of polyatomic molecules at room and ultracold temperatures. Such studies are currently limited, due to the near impossibility of performing quantum dynamical calculations on large polyatomic molecules.  Based on our ""overlapping resonances"" method, initiated in our study of the control of the intramolecular dynamics of Pyrazine, we intend to develop techniques that allow, given an experimental absorption spectrum, to derive and optimize in an easy manner the intramolecular time-evolution. This would enable the enhancement (or suppression) of both transitions between excited electronic states and the ratio between radiationless vs. radiative events. Some of the applications are:  controlling bi-molecular reactions between ultracold molecules; performing logic-gates operations in arrays of molecules trapped in optical lattices and controlling their entanglements with each other; and suppressing/enhancing fluorescence of polyatomic molecules (of great importance to Single Molecule Spectroscopy).

"The proposed research will address problems in dynamics and control of mobile robotic systems within three contexts: (1) space systems for on-orbit servicing of satellites; (2) quadrupedal robots for fast locomotion on rough terrain and (3) small unmanned aerial vehicles, focusing specifically on their autonomous landing. 

Motivation for research in (1) comes from the interest in servicing and retrieval of damaged satellites by using a chaser satellite equipped with a robotic manipulator. The applicant has developed a laboratory for experimental testing of robotic capture of an emulated satellite: a helium balloon, equipped with six propellers to emulate motion in space. The facility has been used to demonstrate capture of a hovering and slowly translating airship. In this work, we will continue to expand the capabilities for this task by developing planning and control algorithms to capture a tumbling satellite and to stabilize the system after capture.  

Research in fast dynamic locomotion of artificial legged systems has been inspired by biological systems. The applicant uses a wheeled quadrupedal platform PAW to study dynamic gaits, and to develop hybrid modes of locomotion which use wheels and legs. We will continue research with PAW to increase its autonomy by building up its repertoire of dynamically stable, hybrid and transitional behaviours. As well, we aim to understand how the parameters of the platform, such as body weight or leg length, affect its performance.

The third research direction has been motivated by increased interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our research will address a critical obstacle to their autonomous operation: that of autonomous landing. This is a challenging task and we will focus specifically on landing of a UAV on a moving base, for example a ship or a ground-based vehicle for refueling. We will develop path planning and control algorithms for a UAV to arrive to a moving target, taking into account its dynamics constraints, and additional performance requirements, such as time to landing. The new algorithms will be tested with the airship and the robot on the translating base in the applicant's laboratory and will be expanded to other UAVs as the research progresses.

"Avian influenza virus (AIV) is a disease-causing virus, which is of great importance to human and poultry health. This virus has already caused significant economic damage to the Canadian poultry industry. During the recent epidemic of AIV in the Fraser Valley, BC, over 17 million chickens were culled. In addition to its impact on viability of the global poultry industry, there are human health concerns associated with epidemics of highly pathogenic AIV. There have been several reports of transmission of the virus from birds to humans in East Asia, Turkey, and Africa. Although human-to-human transmission of the virus is suspected to be extremely rare at this time, the pandemic flu virus will have gained the ability to transmit from infected humans to other individuals. Several strategies may be envisaged for control of AIV in chickens and its transmission to humans. Among these strategies, vaccination is of importance. A suitable vaccine will not only prevent infected chickens from showing clinical signs of disease, but it will also help control virus shedding from the infected birds. This will have an impact on the ability of the virus to spread to other animals and possibly to human populations.  Thus, the proposed studies seek to: 1- design a vaccine formulation with superior ability to elicit protective responses in chickens; 2- test various compounds to further enhance the ability of this vaccine formulation to induce immune response and reduce virus shedding; 3- elucidate the immunological correlates of protection against AIV in chickens. It is expected that the findings of the proposed studies will enhance our knowledge of chicken immunity against AIV and, more importantly, will lead to the development of an efficacious and rational vaccine for control of AIV infection in chickens.

"Maintenance of poultry health has been identified as a major objective by the Canadian poultry industry.

Marek's disease (MD) is an infectious disease caused by a virus, which afflicts poultry operations in North

America and across the globe. The total losses caused by this disease are estimated to be around $1-2

billion/year. MD is characterized by formation oftumours and immunosuppression in infected chickens.

Prevention of MD is highly dependent on vaccines as well as enforcing biosecurity. There are several

commercial vaccines for control of MD, however, none of these vaccines can prevent chickens from shedding

virulent (disease-causing) Marek's disease virus (MDV) should they become infected. Shedding ofvirulent

MDV to the bam environment may lead to spread of the virus to other chickens within the same bam or

neighbouring poultry farms. Moreover, shedding and spread ofMDV leads to an increase in its ability to cause

severe disease in chickens. Therefore, it is important to develop vaccines that could not only control the

disease, but they could also control shedding ofthe virus. The main objective ofthe proposed study is indeed t

develop vaccination strategies for control ofvirus shedding from vaccinated birds. In order to do that we will

investigate: 1- how vaccine viruses can induce host immune responses in various tissues of the chicken, 2- how

these responses can (or caunot) control the virulent virus, 3- how to develop more efficacious vaccines to

control the virulent virus and reduce its shedding. Overall, the proposed studies should lead to better control of

MDV and its ability to gain more disease-causing capacity.","Towards the development of novel vaccines for control of Marek's disease and shedding of Marek's disease virus from feathers","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)",CANADA,CANADA,"Veterinary sciences"

"We are physical beings. We evolved through interaction with natural physical surroundings and elements and much of our experience relies on physical objects and environments. Computers on the other hand were designed initially as abstract generic machines that crunch numbers and do not have direct physical function or meaningful physical form. An important effort in current human-computer interaction research attempts to bring computers closer to our physical reality by allowing them to exploit the users' physical environments as well as humans' innate and learned physical abilities. I explore how humans interact with physical environments, entities and artefacts, I implement these lessons in the form of physical computer interfaces and evaluate how these interfaces affect user interactive experience and behaviour and which lessons can be learned for future interaction design.

In this research I approach two emerging physical interaction themes: human-robot interaction and physical games interfaces. Robots are physical interfaces, capable of sensing their environment as well as of acting and altering it. With robots becoming more common, fundamental questions of physical interaction with humans need to be investigated and answered. I will design intuitive physical robotic interfaces and tools for rapid prototyping and evaluation of collaborative human-robot interfaces. I will also develop high-level interaction techniques that will allow robots to provide users with sociable cues about their state and function.

Current computer games and entertainment experiences are rapidly introducing meaningful physical interaction to the home environment as was recently manifested by the commercially successful Nintendo Wii and its novel mappings between inexpensive accelerometers and gameplay. More evolved physical interfaces will allow an even more immersive gameplay experiences. I will explore ways in which physical touch between players and physical interfaces can enhance gaming experience, and in which computerized games can be played as if they are an integral part of the user's real physical surroundings.","Exploring physicality in interaction","Information systems and technology",CANADA,CANADA,"Information technology"

This proposal is about quantification of colour in digital imaging systems. It relates to how colour information can be accurately communicated and reproduced between devices, for example digital camera to computer monitor or monitor to printer. The increased use of colour in imaging workflows and the development of new digital camera technologies creates the need to better understand how humans see colour in order to produce successful research and products in the world of colour images.



The research has three related objectives. (i) To build upon recent developments in the field of colorimetric and perceptual accuracy of ICC colour profiles for scanners, digital cameras, computer displays and printers. (ii) To study the mathematical processing of camera raw image data for accurate calibration and processing of digital camera data. (iii) To analyse the new generation of LCD flat-panel displays in order to correlate emissive measurements with reflective measurements of colour samples, in order that there is an industry accepted procedure for verification of colour reproduction on soft-copy displays.



The proposal seeks to create a nucleus for colour science studies in Canada. An active collaboration will be pursued with Dr K Plataniotis at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto. This proposal will also provide computer science students (on a new MSc program in Computer Science at Ryerson University) with skills in computational colour science. If funded, this research will begin to create colour imaging science research that combines aspects of camera image processing with practical applications in printing and imaging.

"The province of Saskatchewan is the world's largest potash producer. There are currently 10 potash mines in operation in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan potash industry has been regulated to minimize land use requirements and the environmental footprint of the tailings piles.  This means that any future tailings deposition must be done at steeper side slopes and by increasing pile heights in excess of 50 m. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly critical to ensure the stability of these tailings piles. Already, the potash industry is experiencing an increase in the number of incidences of excessive deformations and instability in these piles. The response of the potash industry has been to place greater emphasis on the design and installation of field monitoring systems to guide the placement of tailings and to provide early warning of excessive deformations and potential failures. This, unfortunately, has not resulted in a significant drop in incidences of pile instability.        Many of the potash tailings piles in Saskatchewan are founded on glaciated soils, which are quite stiff and have fairly high strength. As such, these soils do not approach failure condition under 'normal' loading conditions such as those imposed by buildings and other similar structures. The loading imposed by a tailings pile, however, is anything but 'normal'. A tailings pile, which is essentially a very large embankment, has the potential to cause failure of the glaciated soil over which it is placed. These tailings piles provide a unique opportunity to study the response of glaciated soils subjected to 'near failure' loading conditions and can be regarded as field-scale testing facilities. The proposed research aims to use the monitoring data from the tailings piles as field-scale tests in conjunction with advanced laboratory tests and sophisticated numerical modelling to provide a better understanding of the pre-failure deformation behaviour of glaciated soils. The outcome of the proposed research will lead to safer design of tailings piles and other large structures (such as dams, bridges, tunnels, etc.) founded on glaciated soils and result in significant savings in construction and operations costs.

"The formation of the elements that make up our universe, from the remnants of the big bang that created it, continues to be a fascinating conundrum. While some success has been achieved in the explanation of the production of the light isotopes the mechanisms responsible for the production of the bulk of the heavier elements are still not clear. Calculations based on normal, quietly burning stars do not reproduce the observed abundances for the elements in the universe today. It is thought that at least part of the production of these elements took place during explosive astrophysical events (supernovae and x-ray bursts etc.) that are powered by nuclear reactions among short-lived, radioactive nuclides at the limits of nuclear binding. The atomic masses of these nuclei are essential to understanding these processes because they determine the energy released and determine the path of the nuclear reaction chains that take place in these events. 

The atomic masses of nuclei that participate in super-allowed beta-decay provide a unique opportunity for tests of fundamental symmetries in the standard model for particle physics. The atomic masses of such nuclei, in combination with information about their lifetime and branching ratios, provide an exciting opportunity for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.  

We have constructed a unique instrument system, the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer (CPT), to accurately measure the masses of a wide variety of these short lived, exotic nuclei with great accuracy and sensitivity. The CPT operates on line to the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). With this apparatus precise atomic mass measurements are possible on a wide variety of proton- and neutron- rich isotopes with half-lives as low as 30 ms.

The CPT spectrometer has been used to measure the masses of about 60 isotopes so far. Our results address many exciting scientific issues in nuclear astrophysics and weak interactions.

"The accumulation of misfolded or aggregated protein in a fibrillar form is characteristic of several human diseases including amyloid diseases, such as type II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, as well as spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases).  These diseases are related to the misfolding of different proteins, and exhibit different mechanisms for infectivity, however growing evidence points to a common mechanism for the cytotoxicity of the misfolded proteins.  Specifically, it has been proposed that cell death is caused by small protein aggregates.  Recent studies have indicated that these toxic aggregates are able to directly kill cells by disrupting their membranes; possibly through formation of channels or holes in the plasma membrane, or simply by inducing leakage of cell contents, and that this leads to cell death and progression of the disease state.  In order to unravel this common mechanism for amyloid protein toxicity, we will characterize the molecular structure and membrane-binding behaviour of a neurotoxic fragment of the mammalian prion protein (PrP).  In addition to forming amyloid fibrils, PrP(106-126) has been shown to form small, neurotoxic aggregates and to disrupt membranes, making it a suitable model for our studies.  Using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we will determine the molecular structure of the toxic aggregates formed by this peptide, and define the interactions of PrP(106-126) with model cell membranes.  Specifically, we will:

(1) Determine the structure of oligomers formed by PrP(106-126).

(2) Define the structures formed by PrP(106-126) in lipid bilayers.

(3) Characterize the effects of PrP(106-126) on membrane integrity.

This research will provide the first high-resolution details of the structure of the toxic form of an amyloid-forming peptide, and will illustrate the biophysical basis for protein-lipid interactions which contribute to increased permeability of cell membranes and thus to cytotoxicity in diseases of protein aggregation.

"The tremendous amount of data produced since the sequencing of the human genome raise hopes for understanding biological processes underlying common complex diseases and for curing them. To effectively use the data and realize these hopes, computational analysis tools - carefully tailored for specific biomedical needs - must be developed. In broad terms, the goals of the proposed research are to develop computational, intelligent, statistical data analysis tools for biomedical data, and to model complex biological systems in a way that supports explanation and prediction of disease.



In the past few years, I and my group, in collaboration with prominent researchers throughout the world, have developed several highly effective tools that address eminent current problems in biomedicine. For instance, we developed SherLoc, the most comprehensive and accurate system reported to-date for predicting proteins' location within the cell, by utilizing text and sequence data. We introduced F-SNP - an integrated system for assessing and predicting the functional impact of small mutations on the genome, known as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). We also proposed a new way to use image data within published documents as a step toward well-targeted biomedical text mining.



Building on our proven success in effectively using and integrating text and sequence data, I propose to develop methods for identifying biologically informative areas in text and in images within scientific publications, as well as highly informative functional mutations on the genome. I then plan to specialize and apply the resulting tools to a wealth of disease-related data (specifically Autism and Cancer), supporting early prediction, intervention and effective drug-design.

"Green chemistry is a set of chemical ideals that drive many chemists towards sustainable and environmentally friendly operations. These concepts include: (i) atom economy, where ideally 100% of the atoms you put into a reaction vessel end up in the product, (ii) reduced toxicity, where toxic reagents are exchanged for bioassimilable alternatives, (iii) renewable feedstocks, replacing depleting petroleum-based products with sustainable resources, and (iv) catalysis, where specialized transformations can be performed without the wasteful use of stoichiometric reagents. In particular, the use of petroleum-based non-renewable resources in the production of plastics and polymers and the environmental impact of the associated waste necessitates research into alternatives. Poly(lactic acid), or PLA, is a commercially relevant, non-toxic and biodegradable thermoplastic which is readily produced through the ring-opening polymerization of a chemical called lactide. This lactide monomer is also renewable, as the lactate from which it is ultimately produced is derived from the fermentation of agricultural by-products. Research into PLA has placed it at the forefront of biodegradable polymer research, however applications remain limited to the clothing and packaging industries. Expanding the use of PLA requires chemists to improve and tune the properties of the polymer. Just as our left and right hands cannot be overlain, many molecules also have a characteristic handedness. By controlling how these hands, or stereoisomers, fit together in a polymer chain, we can improve polymer properties: a random arrangement gives a sticky glass, an alternating arrangement gives a white solid, while the desired stereocomplex form of PLA offers enhanced thermal properties. This project designs new catalysts for the stereocontrolled polymerization of lactide. These catalysts will be based on inexpensive metals including iron and vanadium supported by novel phosphorus ligands. Stereocontrol will also be incorporated into larger polymer architectures, including shapes resembling brushes and stars to produce new value-added products. Production of these new materials will expand the applications of environmentally friendly biodegradable polymers to the benefit of society.

"Rocks are the building blocks of our planet and the relationships between the minerals in all rocks provide a record of their history and thus reveal important clues about the earth's evolution.  Field studies of volcanic rocks and their textures lead to development of hypotheses about the history of and reasons for the eruption of volcanoes.  Experimental studies of texture formation allow us to test these ideas and more importantly to place time constraints on texture development, that will aid in developing predictive models for eruptions.

   My research focuses on reading the history of igneous rocks from their textures; in particular, I focus on using experiments to simulate texture development and apply the results to understanding the behaviour of magma in the plumbing systems that lie below volcanoes. In particular, I focus on understanding the rate at which magma moves into magma chambers and the length of time it remains in these chambers prior to its eruption.

   The experiments will be carried out in furnaces capable of reaching temperatures up to 1600 celcius and in high pressure apparatus capable of generating pressure and temperature conditions equivalent to depths of 120 km within the earth.  We will perform several different types of experiment to examine how minerals react with and dissolve into magma within the earth's mantle and crust.  We will also perform experiments with real and analogue magmas that examine how magma is intruded into wet sediments and how such intrusions can lead to large scale volcanic explosions.

  Funding from NSERC will support research projects for three graduate students and five undergraduate students over the next five years.

We are evaluating the feasibility of deconvoluting measured IR and RAMAN spectra for asphaltenes and heavy oil fractions using Density Function Theory based quantum mechanical calculations for aromatic and naphthenic substructures anticipated to be present in ill-defined hydrocarbons, as a basis for refining molecular substructure. Our goal is to make use of quantum mechanical computations without scaling, and to provide quantitative evaluation of substructures present. Significantly improved phase behavior and phase composition prediction for ill-defined hydrocarbons is anticipated, if this project is successful. 

        

        Energy Model Development for Hydrocarbon Mixtures: 

Our recent work on constant pressure heat capacity prediction for pure and complex hydrocarbon mixtures suggests that robust energy models for both pure hydrocarbons and complex hydrocarbon mixtures can be built upon knowledge of elemental composition alone, irrespective of phase state. This is a significant simplification over current approaches, and has the potential to: reduce the number of experimental measurements required, and the uncertainty of energy property predictions for all hydrocarbons.

"In this proposal, we are requesting a Collaborative Research and Development (CRD) grant of $120,000 per year from NSERC to supplement a Grant-in-Aid agreement between BC Hydro and the University of British Columbia.  The grant is to support an ongoing phase in a long-range research program sponsored by BC Hydro and follow on from a previous CRD grant. The overall objective is to develop a way of optimizing the operation of a hydro system. It is not possible to use a single technique to optimize the operation of the whole system as it is much too complex and there are too many planning and operational complexities and uncertainties.  Instead, our approach is to develop a number of ""modules"" that address parts of the overall ""problem"", which are useful in their own right to provide decision support to BC Hydro system planners and operators in the immediate term.  Feedback from BC Hydro planning and operations engineers indicated that the CRD program has improved the way in which the system is operated and have resulted in significant productivity and efficiency gains. Other objectives of the BC Hydro Grant-in-Aid have been to enhance the Civil Engineering program at UBC and strengthen collaboration between the Department and BC Hydro.  We propose to continue these ""bridge-building"" activities and strengthen the CRD program through this application. The research component will focus on the development of useful ""modules"", that will help the system planners and operators to operate the system at or near their maximum potential, and, in addition, to build towards a comprehensive modeling framework for the whole system, which is not available elsewhere, but which is critical to planning and operating large-scale hydro systems. We plan to expand our research program to address policy changes in the electricity sector in Canada and the US to integrate more renewable, clean and green energy sources into existing power systems and we plan to investigate how a hydroelectric system could optimally integrate a portfolio of these new sources of energy while maintaining a high degree of reliability, flexibility as well as technical and economic efficiency.

"In recent years, residential, business and mobile users are combining high speed internet access with real-time applications such as voice and video which results in high data rate wireless communication systems. In these systems, achieving high reliability is a very challenging task due to multi-path fading. The recent technology called ""Multiple-Input Multiple-Output"" (MIMO) promises a solution for this problem.

 

A common drawback of MIMO transmission schemes is that they are not flexible in rate-performance tradeoff. Some work has been reported to address this problem but more novel approaches are required for addressing increasing data-rate requirement of mobile users. Another drawback of MIMO systems is complexity of the mobile receiver due to availability of multiple antennas. To resolve this problem, technologies will be developed to achieve small and low cost mobile units.



For more efficient use bandwidth in today's multi-rate wireless systems, signaling parameters must adapt to varying channel conditions and required quality of service. Therefore, adaptive coding and modulation which is a standard feature of modern wireless systems including MIMO-OFDM has to be developed. This is another topic to be investigated in the proposed research.



Design of a new Space, Time and Frequency spreading technique for MIMO OFDM-CDMA is another important task to be performed in this project. In addition to improved performance via diversity, space-time-frequency spreading offers increased degrees of freedom in multiple access scheduling. Motivated by the fractional frequency reuse in WIMAX standard, multiple access scheduling schemes will be developed to fully taking advantage of the increased degrees of freedom in MIMO OFDM-CDMA.

"The main objectives of this proposal are to carry out large-scale numerical simulations of seismicity using a realistic fault-based computer model and also to develop new statistical methods and techniques in the analysis of seismicity. The primary output of simulations will be catalogs of synthetic earthquakes spanning long periods of time to which we will apply state-of-the-art statistical analysis in order to extract ""signals"" from the ""noise"". Due to complex behavior, the physics and mechanisms of earthquakes are still far from being fully understood. Further research is required to develop realistic models and to use these models to analyze past and future seismic activity. These studies are also crucial from the earthquake hazard assessment point of view where probabilistic forecasting plays an essential part.

    Numerical simulations of earthquake activity are one of the most promising approaches in understanding the mechanisms and physics of earthquakes, the earthquake hazard, and ultimately their forecasting. This approach resembles the ensemble forecasting currently used in weather prediction. However, existing computer models of seismic activity are still in their early development phases and do not reproduce the whole spectrum of the observed properties of earthquakes.

    In summary, in this project we propose to develop a comprehensive computer earthquake simulator in order to better understand the complex interactions between faults in a tectonically active region. We also propose to study various aspects of seismicity in Canada by our recognized methods and techniques, particularly, the statistical distribution of interoccurrence times between earthquakes, in addition to the temporal statistics of seismicity, to analyze its spatial scaling properties. The methods that are employed and the analytic and computational tools that are developed are widely applicable to self-organized complex systems encountered in geophysics. The proposed research will provide a basis for the development and testing of novel earthquake forecasting algorithms based on model simulations.","Seismicity analyses utilizing large-scale computer simulations","Earth sciences",CANADA,CANADA,Geophysics

"Of the senses, vision loss arguably has the greatest impact on quality of life. With the aging population and an increasing incidence of age related blindness, there is a need for devices to replace or augment ocular function or to deliver pharmacologic agents. The discovery of new agents for treating devastating diseases of the eye such as macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy has led to an unprecedented treatment opportunity but a significant need to overcome the challenges of delivering these drugs to the back of the eye.   The equipment requested will enable the biological characterization of the materials developed through this research.","Microscopy equipment for characterization of cells, materials and cell material interactions","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical materials"
"Vision, arguably the most critical of the senses, is dependent on healthy ocular tissues. Unfortunately, disease, aging and congenital defects affect the health of these tissues. 20/20: NSERC Network for the Development of Advanced Opthalmic Materials brings together 11 Canadian researchers from 4 institutions with a goal of developing innovative materials based solutions to solving existing and emerging vision related problems. 



Materials based systems have been used extensively in the eye but not without complications. Contact lenses and intraocular lenses, in particular, are widely accepted by the general public although these are far from perfect solutions. Contact lens complications and comfort continue to remain serious issues. Intraocular lenses, which are used restore sight to patients following cataract surgery, suffer from a 5 year post surgical failure rate as high as 40% due to the formation of secondary cataracts.  Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS), a secondary inflammation following cataract surgery, has recently seen increased incidence.  



The 14 20/20 research projects will lead to the development of materials which may for example result to contact lenses without end of day dryness and discomfort issues, intraocular lenses with a low complication rate, delivery systems for the back of the eye to take away the need for monthly painful and inconvenient injections.

"Vision loss in Canada due to such diseases as age related macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy , is increasing at a dramatic rate with the aging of the population. Estimates suggest that the current 2.1 million Canadians with AMD will triple over the next 25 years.  In addition to the obvious consequences, vision loss also has a significant effect on patient quality of life. People with vision impairment, compared to the visually competent population of the same age, are admitted to nursing homes three years earlier, suffer from depression at a rate that is three times higher, fall twice as often, suffer hip fractures at a rate that is four times higher, and are twice as likely to die prematurely. While the real costs of these diseases are unknown, it has been estimated that total direct cost to governments in Canada for glaucoma alone in 2001 was CDN$300 million.  The effectiveness of novel therapeutics under development for treating these diseases, particularly diseases of the back of the eye, is limited by the inaccessibility of this tissue. Furthermore, reversal of these diseases will ultimately require cell replacement through delivery of cellular components. The Sheardown research program is aimed at developing novel biomaterials for treatment of vision disorders by replacing diseased or damaged tissue with appropriate cellular components coupled with a biomaterial scaffold or by augmenting existing treatment methods by controlling and prolonging delivery of therapeutic agents. The program encompasses a broad range of ocular diseases and vision disorders including diseases of front and back of the eye as well as refractive problems. By exploiting the biological characteristics of the specific ocular system, we will, through this program, develop a suite of materials, comprised of both synthetic and natural polymers with various properties, for treating vision disorders.

"The purpose of this proposal is to develop a mathematical framework for sequential stochastic decision making when the set of available actions, and their effects, changes over time.  Modeled as nonhomogeneous Markov decision processes (MDPs), such situations apply to decisions about equipment replacement, facility location, and workforce planning.  Our motivation comes from medical decision making questions.  For example, when should a patient initiate or switch drug therapies when billions of dollars are invested annually in the research and development (R&D) of new therapies? Standard decision models do not consider this dynamic, yet websites have recently been created to disseminate information to physicians and their patients on clinical trials under way and results from trials already completed. Presumably, models that explicitly consider the uncertainty around effective therapies becoming available in the future would yield different results than models that do not consider this uncertainty.  

   The proposed research aims to quantify differences between models that do not consider evolving actions and effects, and models that do consider these dynamics.  In doing this, we will develop methods for estimating model parameters that describe R&D, such as probabilities of therapies becoming available at different times in the future, along with their effects.  Other methodological contributions will include discovering structural properties of optimal solutions and finding efficient solution algorithms. The overall contributions of this research are both in the practical applications to medical decision making problems as well as the discovery of fundamental insights when considering time-varying action sets in MDPs.

"How do we learn from our mistakes?  How does practice improve performance? How do we become experts? My students and I study cognitive and attentional control and the brain processes underlying the changes that occur as a novice becomes an expert, particularly the experience dependent changes to cognitive, attentional, and memory processes. We study neural events by measuring scalp potentials from a high density array of electrodes which detect millisecond resolution voltage changes generated by neurons.  The high temporal resolution of event-related potentials (ERP) allows us to ask specific questions about neural changes related to practice and learning. Of particular interest is how performance is monitored during practice, how errors are detected, and how behaviour is altered in response to errors. Action video game players who play games for long periods of time over many years develop particular visual spatial skills that can be operationally defined and measured in the laboratory.  Most published work on video game players focuses on the social aspects of game playing, and only recently have people started studying the cognitive and attentional changes that gamers experience. We study video game players to understand how their expertise develops and how it generalizes to performance on other tasks. A domain in which we are all experts is face recognition. Most face recognition research focuses on perception, identity, and visual memory. Fewer studies look specifically at associated semantic information, yet the face identification that we experience every day involves retrieval of person-specific information. We are studying alterations in behaviour and brain correlates of face processing as knowledge about a person is acquired. Our goal is the exploration of cognitive and attentional control mechanisms, experience dependent changes in attention and memory, and development of expertise.  Loss of control is debilitating as observed in disorders such as attention deficit, autism, depression, and addiction. Our results will help improve models of cognitive and attentional control, and help to develop cognitive remediation strategies for brain damage or disease, and declines in normal aging.

"The heart, circulation, lungs, and chest wall all act together in a highly coordinated fashion.  Studying each system in isolation can provide valuable information but examining how these systems act together provides a more comprehensive understanding of human physiology.   The objective of my research program is to use intermittent hypoxia (Part I) and respiratory muscle work (Part II) to study the mechanisms by which the respiratory and cardiovascular systems influence each other.  



PART I.  Intermittent hypoxia, or repeated episodes of low oxygen, has unique effects on the control of breathing and the cardiovascular system.  In Part I the different components of cardiovascular regulation will be assessed in humans following exposure to two weeks of daily exposure (1 hr) to hypoxia.  This is important to our understanding of how low levels of oxygen in the blood affect multiple biological systems.  The model of intermittent hypoxia is based on previous NSERC work.  



PART II.  The diaphragm and other respiratory muscles are unique skeletal muscles in that they must cyclically contract for 24 h/day in order to sustain life.  In Part II, I will study the mechanisms by which respiratory muscle work affects the distribution of blood from the heart.  This is a relationship that has been typically underappreciated.  Specifically, there is a significant 'cost' to breathing and Part II will determine the contributing factors.



It is anticipated that the information from the proposed studies can be applied to future studies of healthy humans and those at risk of respiratory and cardiovascular disease.

"My research addresses the algorithmic aspects of geometry modeling and processing. Since shape is a fundamental property of real-life objects, any virtual representation of reality begins with a description of the geometry of the objects involved. The general objective of my research is to develop new technologies to broaden the foundations of geometry processing and extend the range of its applications. In particular, one of my long-term goals is to make the creation and manipulation of 3D geometry accessible to a wide range of users. Currently this is not the case, as most existing modeling systems are targeted toward expert users and require significant time, expertise, and artistic talent to create or modify such models. In my research I aim to make 3D modeling ubiquitous, providing intuitive and simple interfaces for the user, while introducing sophisticated algorithmic tools to perform the actual data processing. 

In this research proposal I would like to cater to users with different backgrounds and levels of familiarity with computerized tools: animators developing games or movies, artists using computers as a new tool or media, engineers, and home users.  To address these audiences the emphasis within this framework is placed on a number of specific applications:

- Developing easy-to-control techniques for static and dynamic realistic looking deformation of geometric models.  

- Investigating analysis techniques for ""shape understanding"" that enable computer systems to automatically perform the geometrically challenging modeling tasks, enabling even novice users to easily create sophisticated models. 

- Providing tools for artistic modeling in 3D that simplify the spatially challenging data manipulation allowing the artist to focus on the creative aspects of the modeling process. 

- Developing tools for engineering shape design, particularly focusing on design with developable surfaces.

"In our everyday experience, particles trapped inside energy wells can escape only if they have more energy than the energy barrier; a marble trapped in a bowl stays inside unless it has enough energy to rise to the top of the bowl and get out. For microscopic particles it is possible for a particle to escape even if its energy is less than the barrier. This phenomenon is call ""tunnelling."" Tunnelling has been investigated almost solely for single particles. Investigations into the tunnelling of molecules began relatively recently. The simplest molecule consists of two atoms and thus has an elongated structure: this is what makes the study of tunnelling of molecules interesting and challenging. In order to escape confinement inside an energy barrier, both atoms need to tunnel out, and there are several ways this can happen. For example: the molecule breaks up into two atoms.

  In the proposed research we investigate how the possible breaking up of the molecule affects the probability of tunnelling. In previous work we found that for special values of the molecule's total energy, the probability is 100%, and is called ""resonant tunnelling."" In the case of molecular tunnelling, we want to find out how the possibility of molecular break-up will affect these resonances, i.e. we know that the probability will go down, but the question is by how much and why that amount?

  We will first consider a molecule moving along a straight line. We will extend our work to the more realistic case where the molecule moves in three dimensions.  Our goal is to understand why the probabilities of tunnelling and reflection have the values they do and why they change with the energy of the molecule as they do, and not some other way. We will also study the special case where the molecule is very weakly bound, i.e. it will certainly break apart in attempting to tunnel. This will also be done for one and three dimensions. Our ultimate objective is to extend our study so that it can be compared with real molecules and other pairs of particles. We will also do two other investigations in the behaviour of quantum mechanical systems.

  This work will eventually have practical applications; the specific details are not known at this time.

"The concept of sustainable development has been gaining increasing attention in North America and worldwide. The concept calls for meeting our current needs without compromising the needs of future generations. In construction, sustainable development is achieved through different approaches including: (a) minimizing the use of natural resources, such as stones, and maximizing the recycling of reclaimed construction materials in new structures, (b) conservation of lands through reducing the amount of construction and industrial wastes disposed in landfills, (c) reducing the consumption of Portland cement through increasing the use of supplementary cementing materials (SCM) in concrete and construction materials, and (d) producing construction materials of enhanced durability and longer service life. This research project is designed to target the aforementioned approaches. Specifically, the objectives of this project are threefold: (1) to develop practical applications in which demolished concrete, known as Reclaimed Concrete Aggregate (RCA), can be used in lieu of natural stones (these applications include trench filling, structural fill, and concrete for public works), (2) to evaluate some durability aspects in regards to the effects of alkalis contributed from RCA on the reactivity of natural aggregates used with RCA in the same concrete mix (this will complement current research in the area of RCA at other Canadian universities), and (3) to investigate the properties and durability of concrete containing more than one type of SCM (namely slag and fly ash).



Recycling demolished concrete as aggregate in different applications reduces the consumption of natural aggregates and helps in land conservation by reducing the construction wastes disposed in landfills. The same can be said for SCM which are industrial by-products that have been proven to be beneficial to concrete when the right type and amount are used.  Promoting the use of both RCA and SCM will significantly contribute to construction sustainability in Canada.

"The aging infrastructure presents a serious challenge to the engineering community especially in the light of recent bridge collapses in North America. These structures designed in accordance with the existing codes are now deficient to various degrees. One of the greatest risks in Canada is the collapse of concrete buildings and the associated loss especially during an earthquake. Clearly more work is needed to move towards better sustainability of reinforced concrete structures. This can be accomplished: 1) by better design to improve the performance of structures and 2) by making the rehabilitation and repair of existing structures more feasible and efficient, thereby extending their service life. This will have an added advantage of reducing the ecological harm to the planet. 



This research is designed with these goals in mind thus directly addressing society's needs. Better analytical tools and design procedures will be developed. Newer materials such as glass and carbon fibre reinforced polymers, high performance concrete and innovative techniques will be investigated for new structures as well as retrofitting existing structures. Results obtained so far from the ongoing research program have already influenced the engineering practice in a significant manner. Innovative techniques developed have been used in practice such as upgrade of bridges along Highways 400, 401 and QEW. Results and design procedures have also been incorporated in various design codes and design manuals in Canada and elsewher. Future work will be carried out with the same methodology, and will focus on concrete columns, beams and floor slab systems.

Spin Electronics (or spintronics) is a new and emerging field of science and engineering that exploits the spin of electrons, in addition to their charge, for the purpose of information storage, transport, and manipulation. The ultimate aim of research in spintronics is the discovery and invention of new devices, such as spin transistors, and their integration into semiconductor technology so as to create better functionality and performance at lower cost and complexity. The purpose of this research is to explore circuit techniques for spin-based devices that are suitable for nonvolatile memory applications, replacing conventional memory technologies such as DRAM, SRAM, Flash, and EEPROM.



The basic structure of a spin-based memory cell is a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) that consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a thin layer of insulating material. One of the two ferromagnetic layers is a thick layer whose magnetization if fixed. The other one is a thin layer, also called free layer, whose magnetization can be switched between a direcation that is either parallel or anti-parallel to that of the fixed layer. This corresponds to storing a digital 1 or 0 in the cell. Reading the stored bit is achieved by examining the resistance of the cell. This resistance is low for the parallel state and high for the anti-parallel state. 



There are several challenges in the operation of the MTJ device that must be addressed before the spin-based memory could compete favourably against Flash. Our goal, in this proposal, is to devise circuit techniques in order to circumvent the device shortcomings and ease the requirements on the underlying technology.

"Currently, about 30-40% of the fresh market apples produced in Canada (farm gate value of $164M) is treated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), which helps to maintain fruit quality and extend shelf life, thereby increasing marketing opportunities. The only negative response has been increased susceptibility to low temperature- and CO2-related disorders in certain apple cultivars during controlled atmosphere (CA) storage. CA conditions can result in an imbalance between oxidative and reductive processes at the cellular level and in the accumulation of a metabolite called gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA). While GABA accumulation is a well known response to all stresses in photosynthetic tissues, its role and the mechanisms associated with its accumulation in non-photosynthetic tissues are largely unexplored. In this proposal, we intend to investigate whether GABA and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a closely related metabolite whose accumulation is regulated by redox status, and their potential precursors (polyamines versus glutamate), are associated with external injury and flesh browning in apples from two popular Canadian cultivars ('Empire' and McIntosh'). The apples will be stored under various CA conditions of temperature and CO2 with or without 1-MCP treatment and metabolite profiles, as well as fruit quality, will be determined as a function of storage time using reverse-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry. Also, we intend to investigate the relative importance of polyamine- and glutamate-derived GABA production in apple fruit using a combination of biochemical (enzyme activities, tracer) and molecular (gene expression) analyses. This project should lead to improved

understanding of the mechanisms responsible for physiological disorders in stored apples, and could lead to  development of diagnostics/technologies for assessing injury potential and genetic engineering and marker-assisted selection strategies for ameliorating injury.","Impact of 1-MCP and controlled atmosphere on physiological disorders in stored apples: GABA and polyamine metabolism",Agriculture,CANADA,CANADA,"Stress physiology"
"At a time when the entire set of gene and protein sequences in plants is becoming available, there is increasing need to understand protein structure/function and metabolic regulation. For the past two decades, my laboratory has developed internationally recognized leadership in the metabolism and function(s) in plants, of the amino acid gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and the short-chain fatty acid gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), which closely resembles GABA. They are endogenous constituents of the mammalian nervous system, wherein GABA plays a role in neural transmission and development, and functions through interactions with specialized receptors, and GHB serves as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator postulated to act via a GABAB receptor or an independent GHB-specific receptor. The physiological roles of GABA and GHB in plants are not yet clear, but evidence suggests that they are linked to stress and communication. Our research involves an innovative and integrative approach using physiological, biochemical, and biotechnological methods to identify and understand the regulation of genes/proteins and pathways associated with these metabolites. Our results will not only advance fundamental knowledge, but also suggest potential targets for engineering stress resistance or the synthesis of novel bioplastics in plants, as well as biomarkers for stress-induced injury.","Metabolism and functions of GABA","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Plant and treebiology"
"Genes and proteins that control epithelial cell differentiation (specialization) and survival control cell fate during tissue development. We use the model system of the mammary gland to study the process of differentiation from undifferentiated mammary epithelial stem and progenitor cells (capable of forming all the epithelial cells of the gland) to the final specification of the milk secretory cells. We use a novel, multidisciplinary approach to study stem cell function that combines the enrichment and novel culture of stem and progenitor cells, with their assessment in an in vivo stem cell assay. Our research identified a new key regulator of mammary epithelial differentiation in a gene-array screen for genes that regulate development. We have additional candidates awaiting characterization. Overall, we propose a mechanism by which upstream signals in undifferentiated mammary epithelial stem cells establish a permissive microenvironment in which final functional differentiation and control of survival is regulated by prolactin. Prolactin is a peptide hormone essential for mammary gland development. We also identified two prolactin-regulated genes that alternatively control cell survival or apoptosis. We hypothesize that they regulate the switch from survival to apoptosis in the mammary gland. We believe that prolactin regulated target genes not only promote survival but alternatively can sensitize the cells for the imminent destruction of prolactin-responsive cells that occurs with weaning. Our work will provide an understanding of the molecular controls governing stem cell differentiation and cell survival, using a tissue development model that is perfectly suited for this investigation. It is essential to understand these functions in order to understand tissue development, tissue regeneration and even cancer.","Mammary gland biology - differentiation and development","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Cell differentiation"

Significant progress has been made in the last three decades in determining the general mean circulation from various oceanographic observations and numerical model results in the region. Less progress was made, however, in quantifying the seasonal and inter-annual variability of circulation and hydrodynamic connectivity in the region. The long-term objectives of this proposal are to examine the seasonal and inter-annual variability of circulation and assess the effects of physical processes on the marine ecosystem dynamics on the eastern Canadian shelf. The short-term objectives of the proposal are (1) to study the variability in the last 50 years using three-dimensional ocean circulation models, (2) to calculate the retention/dispersion and hydrodynamic connectivity; and (3) to develop a coupled bio-physical numerical model for the study region.","Variability of circulation and hydrodynamic connectivity over the eastern Canadian shelf","Oceans, seas and estuaries",CANADA,CANADA,"Physical oceanography"
"Funds to purchase a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) protein purification system are requested to aid the structural and functional studies of the yeast Plant Homeo-Domain (PHD) finger proteins led by the new investigator Dr. Yi Sheng at York University.  The PHD finger proteins are small zinc-binding proteins, found to be involved in many important cellular processes such as gene regulation, immunity and development. The requested equipment will be used to purify yeast PHD finger proteins for three-dimensional structure determination and interaction studies with other cellular proteins. The outcome of this research will provide insight into the functional divergence of PHD finger proteins and reveal how mutations in these PHD finger affect cellular processes.  The FPLC system is essential to the success of the proposed research.

Aerial/space remote sensors acquire overwhelming amount of data at the present time for opto-electronic surveillance with multi-spectrum, multi-temporal, georeference data and significantly increased spatial, spectra! and radiometric resolutions. High-resolution aerial images permit to extract 3D information on the grounded objects. Manually processing those data for image registration and fusion, environmental change identification and object detection could be time-consuming and inconsistent for the large-scale image bank. The similar problematic exists in the civil digital libraries, which contain huge amount of visual data in the multimedia and database, thanks to rapid growth in the multimedia acquisition, storage, transmission, visualization, and interaction technologies.

The proposal consists of two related projects: context-driven surveillance and component-based 3D object detection, addressing two of the basic problems in aerial surveillance: where to search and how to detect the objects. Context-driven focusing of attention will be studied using the new beamlet transform, which searches for object-of-interest and the neural networks and support vecotr machines for context operations. Detection of 3D object will be studied in terms of invariant feature and component feature extraction and of height information estimation using simultaneous localization and map building techniques.

The proposed research will deliver internal reports, publications and effective software to the three partners: Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC) Valcartier, Optronic Surveillance Data Exploitation Group and Lockheed-Martin Canada (LM). The objective of the proposed research is to acquire, develop and generate new knowledge and expertise on the state-of-the art technologies in the aerial/space electro-optic image surveillance and 3D object detection.

"The upper atmosphere near 100 km is a complex region influenced by the atmosphere above and below. From above, solar ultraviolet radiation is absorbed, splitting molecules into atoms, and removing electrons to form ions. The resulting chemistry produces airglow, visible light that may be sensed using optical instrumentation on the ground below, or from space above. Atomic oxygen is a long-lived driver for airglow, and so may be used as a tracer for atmospheric motions, providing a way to study the dynamics at these altitudes, in part using a Canadian space instrument (WINDII) of the applicant's design flown on a NASA satellite from 1991 to 2003. A Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager (SATI) developed in his laboratory and located on the ground at Resolute Bay (74 N) in northern Canada has measured upper atmospheric airglow and temperature since 2001. Large winter to winter variations are found to be controlled by solar variation, as well as by the east-west wind at the equator, a remarkable dynamical influence. Large correlated variations in airglow and temperature during the winter are found to originate with planetary waves, weather waves, coming up from below. It was also discovered that the temperatures in the upper mesosphere at 87 km correlate with those at 22 km, in the lower stratosphere.  These discoveries will be exploited in moving towards understanding this variability. It is proposed to extend the Resolute Bay dataset from its beginning in 2001 to cover one solar cycle of eleven years and at the same time to explore the coupling between the upper mesosphere and lower stratosphere through atmospheric models. The satellite data acquired from 1991 to 2003 will be further analyzed and data from other satellites will be employed as well. In addition, the applicant is involved in the design and fabrication of an airglow camera to be flown on a Kazakh spacecraft, to determine if earthquake precursors produce perturbations in the airglow. With the understanding of airglow variability that has been established, it will be possible to detect earthquakes in advance, a very unusual and important form of atmospheric variability if it is found to exist.

"Biosensors are a class of device engineered to recognize a target biomolecule in a given environment. They have been used in the medical community for the early detection and treatment of disease but are also desirable as methods of detecting biological warfare agents. As such, the attributes of a sensor often include minaturized size, high specificity, multi-functionality and the absence of false positives. With the ever changing requirements of the sensor, new methods for the creation and characterization of the sensor material are ongoing. Typically the bio-recognition event is based on molecular binding with a substrate and surface modification strategies exist to functionalize the material with specific receptor groups. To enhance possible multi-functionality, a variety of receptor groups is desirable and is made possible through surface patterning methods. Our research focuses on the use of electrochemical techniques to uniquely design and characterize a surface coated with organic-receptor materials in a patterned geometry. We will combine our experience with surface patterning of bulk surfaces to decorate gold nanoparticles in a similar manner. Coupling the device to a spectroscopic method of Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy (SPR) will enhance our detection schemes beyond typical SPR investigations.

"The objective of the proposal is to analyze correlative measurements of temperature, water vapour and aerosols throughout the middle atmosphere (20-100 km height) and study the coupling of the stratosphere and mesosphere. Temperature, water vapour and aerosols are the three main themes in this proposal. Temperature is a central theme that links the presence of thin aerosol layers (e.g. Polar Stratospheric Clouds, Polar Mesospheric Clouds) to the amount of H2O, CO2 and CH4 in the stratosphere and upper mesosphere. The temperature is also a key factor in determining the dynamical structure of the mesosphere/lower thermosphere region. Water vapour content is also a central theme since it can be used as a tracer for various dynamical processes in the stratosphere and the upper mesosphere far from its source region in the lower atmosphere. Water in the middle atmosphere is the most important greenhouse gas crucial to climate change, because of its influence on Earth's radiative budget, and the human influence on the production of CH4, which is an important source of H2O in the middle atmosphere. Temperature change is a critical element in the conversion of water from vapour to liquid form, so the formation of solid water is an indicator of global change that can readily be monitored. Aerosols in the stratosphere can significantly impact atmospheric chemistry, dynamics, radiation and climate by absorbing outgoing long-wave radiation and thus change the thermal balance of the middle atmosphere. They can also affect climate by enhancing upward air motion in the lower stratosphere and alter stratospheric dynamics, in turn influencing the dynamics of the mesosphere. Knowledge of the properties of stratospheric aerosol is also important in analyzing data from space-borne instruments, whose measurements are affected by aerosol presence. The stratospheric aerosols could be quite sensitive to input from the tropical troposphere (volcanic eruption, burning), while meteoric material descending into the stratosphere from the mesosphere may be important to the morphology of stratospheric aerosols, particularly in polar air and perhaps globally, similar to their role in the summer mesosphere.

"Our research has included attachment of peptide units to rigid organic scaffolds to create template-assembled synthetic proteins (TASPs). We propose further work in this area. We also propose research in a new but related area, template-assembled synthetic G-quartets (TASQs).



The proposed TASP work entails the challenge of creating and characterizing synthetic proteins that have structural integrity on par with those of natural proteins. We have recently shown that we can attach different peptide units to our organic scaffold, as opposed to four identical units. These hetero-TASPs may enable us to create better-packed proteins, and may find application in catalytic systems. We have also created larger helical bundles (i.e., those containing 5 and 6 helices). We will attempt to enhance their native-like qualities. We have recently obtained a crystal structure of a TASP, the first ever. We will explore this futher, in an effort to lead to evermore sophisiticated synthetic protein structures.



We have recently embarked on the creation of TASQs. We have been successful at efficiently synthesizing an organic scaffold configured with four guanines. This TASP manifests G-quartet structure in chloroform solution, even in the absence of cations. Such a cation-free unimolecular G-quartet is highly unusual. We will explore the morphology of this system in the presence of cations, and will endeavor to create hydrophilic TASQs. Potential applications include creation of aptamers with anti-cancer activity, and screening of G-quartet binding proteins from cell extracts.

"Go into most Canadian backyards and you are likely to see numerous examples of apparently protective colour patterns: moths that resemble their backgrounds, warningly-coloured ladybugs, and harmless hoverflies that gain protection by resembling stinging wasps or bees. These phenomena have played a unique role in shaping the way both academics and the general public think about evolutionary processes. Thus, the theory of mimicry has been described as ""perhaps the greatest post-Darwinian application of natural selection"" (Fisher 1958), while documentaries regularly showcase adaptation by reference to exquisite examples of protective coloration.



Over the last century, scientists have come to understand precisely how particular defensive traits serve to protect individuals from being eaten. However, a more fundamental question relates to the diversity of anti-predator adaptations themselves: why do some species evolve one form of defence, while other species evolve another?  In this research program we will test - using field experiments, comparative analyses and evolving artificial life - a series of fundamental hypotheses concerning the conditions that govern the type of anti-predator strategy that evolves in a given species. We will also develop mathematical models that recognize the possibility that the defence that evolves in one species influences the nature of the defence that evolves in other species, and we shall test these insights by quantifying the distribution of different defensive strategies in a range of natural food webs. Finally, although the need to avoid predators has traditionally been considered in isolation from other selective forces, we will ask whether the evolved defence influences an organism's rate of ageing. Do palatable species senesce more rapidly than unpalatable species?  Nobody knows, but the answer not only provides a test of evolutionary theories of ageing, but also helps to set the study of anti-predator adaptation in a broader life-history context. This research is not about adding footnotes, but testing ""big picture"" hypotheses as to how and why the diversity of anti-predator adaptations is generated and maintained.

"Infrastructure deterioration is one of the most significant challenges facing the profession of Civil Engineering in North America. The Government of Ontario, for example, acknowledges that deterioration has resulted in a $100 billion ""infrastructure deficit"" in Ontario alone. An unprecedented effort must be undertaken to not only address the current infrastructure deficit, but to plan for an expected population increase in Ontario of 4 million people over the next 25 years. 



Deterioration is a particular concern for reinforced concrete structures, such as bridges, parking decks, and buried structures. Current construction techniques, however, typically employ the traditional materials and design methods that have lead to the current rates of deterioration. Hence, it is important to research the integration of modern, durable materials with current reinforced and prestressed concrete construction. Fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) is one such material which holds considerable promise to improve infrastructure durability. The addition of steel or polymeric fibres to the concrete mix results in higher concrete tensile strengths, smaller crack widths and reduced reinforcement requirements. These improved characteristics lessen ingress of deleterious substances that can result in concrete deterioration.



The main barrier to more widespread implementation of FRC is the lack of appropriate design methods for the material. This study will focus on experimental studies focused on understanding the behaviour of FRC elements subjected to shear loads.  These experimental studies will result in simple, rational design methods appropriate for design professionals.

"Contamination of groundwater by organic contaminants represents one of the most urgent challenges facing environmental scientists, industry, government regulators and society. This application addresses directly the Target Area Healthy Environment and Ecosystems, specifically addressing the research topics under Waste Management and Site Remediation, and Water Resources. The proposal focuses on an important group of priority pollutants - chlorinated hydrocarbons - many of which are toxic and confirmed or suspected carcinogens, and which are among the most common contaminants found at sites across Canada in both rural and urban settings. Degradative processes, both biological and abiotic, are a major focus of research on remediation of these contaminants. Estimating the effectiveness of these methods on contaminant attenuation has to date relied primarily on measurement of the concentration of pollutants in field tests, column experiments and laboratory microcosm experiments, and on microbiological approaches to identify key organisms and degradation pathways. In complex, naturally variable field settings however, it is often difficult to quantify reaction rates, and to determine the relative importance of degradation versus other processes of mass loss such as dilution, sorption, and volatilization and to distinguish which of a variety of potential degradation processes are at work. New analytical tools to measure the effectiveness of these methods and technologies are urgently needed. The proposed research addresses this target directly by investigating the use of Compound Specific Isotope Analysis (CSIA) to improve assessment of remediation effectiveness and to predict time required to achieve target clean-up levels (by providing a novel method for estimating rates), and to improve capacity for trouble-shooting and optimizing remedial schemes.

"Scientific investigations of the energy basis for deep subsurface microbial environments on earth are at the forefront of interdisciplinary collaboration between geologists, planetary scientists, microbiologists and astrobiologists and a major focus of my research program in Isotope Geochemistry of the Earth and Environment. Our deep biosphere research on the stable Precambrian cratons of Canada, South Africa and Finland has demonstrated that microbial life based on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis is not limited to those parts of the earth where significant magmatic or hydrothermal activity occurs. In the highly fractured geologically quiescent Shield terrains, over timescales of tens of thousands to millions of years, the products of low temperature (< approx. 200oC) water-rock interaction (WRI) can accumulate and serve as substrate for deep microbial communities. In particular, the Precambrian Shield sites we are studying contain mM levels of dissolved H2 - levels that place these waters among the most H2-rich environments on the planet. Our research also addresses developing diagnostic environmental parameters to distinguish between abiogenic hydrocarbons produced by WRI, from hydrocarbon gases produced by microbial processes, or found in sedimentary basin natural gas deposits. These discoveries have expanded our conception of the habitability of the earth's subsurface environment and may significantly increase estimates of the relative importance of the subsurface biosphere.

"Newborns of all species are exquisitely susceptible to infection; thus, nature has provided for immediate passive immunity by transfer of maternal antibodies (MatAb) across the placenta (humans) or in colostrum (calves).   Even so, this may be inadequate if the dam has not mounted a strong antibody response herself, or in calves, if the newborn fails to ingest sufficient colostrum. Early induction of active immunity by vaccination would ensure protection for calves with low MatAb and provide continuity of immunity for those with higher passive titres. To achieve this, innovative approaches are needed since induction of active immunity in neonates is compromised both by immaturity of the immune system and, ironically, by down regulation due to MatAb. In natural infection, the protein complement component C3 binds irreversibly to potential pathogens, and the bound fragment, C3d, enhances immune response by reacting with receptors on cells that present antigens to the immune system and on antibody producing B cells. Experimentally, the threshold for B cell activation was reduced 10,000 fold in mice when multiple C3ds were bound to vaccine antigens. To investigate C3d's potential to enhance active immunity in neonatal calves, we have cloned and sequenced the gene coding for bovine C3d and expressed the recombinant protein (BoC3d) in several forms. Neonatal calves have low serum C3, but BoC3d bound to vaccine antigens may compensate for limited natural C3, and could override suppressive signals from MatAb. Initially, we will use fluorescence activated cell scan (FACs) to document changes in expression of receptors for C3d on B cells as calves age, to assess activation of B cells in response to BoC3d complexes, and to evaluate the effects of MatAb on B cell function in the presence of BoC3d.  Constructs with optimal activity will then be tested for capacity to enhance active immunity in neonatal calves. As a model, we use vaccine containing C3d and the leukotoxin (Lkt) of Mannheimia haemolytica, a common bovine pathogen.  Its role in calfhood pneumonia makes this a relevant target for study and our extensive experience with Lkt facilitates assessment of immune response and vaccine efficacy.","Bovine complement component C3d as an adjuvant to facilitate early calfhood vaccination",Agriculture,CANADA,CANADA,"Veterinary sciences"

"The proposed research concerns with the study of soft materials including polymers, liquid crystals, surfactant solutions, colloidal suspensions, and biological materials such as lipid membranes and biomolecular assemblies. The application of basic physics ideas to the study of soft matter is one of the major growth areas of modern physics. My research projects focus on self-assembly of soft materials. These projects are designed to elucidate fundamental principles and guidance for the design and optimization of soft materials with controlled internal structures, as well as providing a useful paradigm for understanding self-assembly of general physical systems such as surfactants, lipids and virus. 



Specifically, block copolymers are chosen as a model system for the study. This choice is based on the importance of block copolymers in technology, the richness of their phase behavior, and my expertise in theoretical polymer physics. Block copolymers are macromolecules composed of chemically different blocks tethered together, which spontaneously form a variety of ordered phases with domain sizes in the nanoscopic range (1-100nm). Understanding the structure and phase transitions observed in block copolymers has been the one of the most active research areas in polymer science in the past decades. The current proposal continues my past success in this area, focusing on the self-assembly and thermodynamic properties of block copolymers with complex molecular structures. We will study a few inter-related projects. (1) The studies of the structure and phase transition of multi-block copolymers, focusing on the occurrence of complex ordered structures. (2) The investigation of the phase behavior of block copolymers containing semi-flexible and/or chiral blocks, focusing on the effects of chain structure on the self-assembled phases. (3) The examination of the effects of external fields such as applied electric field or confinement field, focusing on how self-assembly processes can be purposefully manipulated by external forces.

"Numerous academic research results have been obtained and a number of business solutions have been developed for supply chain management. However, all the research results and business solutions have not been implemented in business practice as much as we want. One key reason is that most existing models and solutions assume that agents (e.g., individuals and firms) are risk-neutral and adopt the objective of (expected) profit maximizing. However, in business practice, agents are oftentimes risk-averse and engage in target-based decision making. That is, they have performance measure targets to achieve and they adopt the satisficing objectives, i.e., they maximize the probabilities of achieving those targets. Further, agents oftentimes adopt multiple objectives based not only on profit but also on other performance measures such as revenue and market share. The long-term objective of my research is to develop models and solutions of supply chain management when the satisficing objectives or multiple objectives are involved. The potential research results will contribute to the development of both theories and practical business solutions.

"Infants face many challenges during early language development. Spoken words are not separated by blank spaces. Infants must find word forms from running speech, much like the challenge we face when we first hear a foreign language. In addition, infants must classify words into grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, prepositions, etc. They also need to map word forms to appropriate meanings. These tasks are not trivial because parents provide neither explicit lessons, nor overt feedback to infants. Based on the theory that I have proposed, the solution to these problems may lie in the processing of function morphemes (such as auxiliaries, articles, etc). These elements are extremely frequent in the language and have distinct spoken forms when compared to content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs). Previous research including studies from my research group showed that infants during the first year of life can perceive function morphemes and use these items to find words from running speech. As part of my long-term NSERC program, the proposed research will test the hypothesis that infants rely on function morphemes to break into early language. We will examine the role of function morphemes in infants' initial learning of morphological parsing (for example, the interpretation of word roots and suffixes), grammatical categorisation of words, and mapping of meanings to word forms. In doing so, we will specifically investigate the interactions of different learning mechanisms (for example, frequency versus prosodically based learning) associated with function morphemes, and attempt to determine the influence of the native language to infants' initial biases. These studies may contribute to the fundamental debate on the nature-nurture question in language acquisition.","Functional morphemes and mechanisms of early language processing",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Cognitive science -- development"

"The wide acceptance of Internet-based technologies, the pervasiveness of transaction-based techniques in a multitude of systems (such as telecommunication ones), as well as the emergence of Grid systems, all strongly emphasize the paramount importance of distributed algorithms in today's computing world. Also, the use of mobile agents is becoming increasingly popular when computing in networked environments. But the presence of security threats greatly complicates solutions for all but non-trivial tasks. That is, in systems supporting mobile agents, security is the most pressing concern, and possibly the most difficult to address. The overall objective of this research consists in developing efficient and testable distributed algorithms that use mobile agents to solve non-trivial tasks in unsafe networks, that is, in the presence of security threats. The proposed research is organized into three broad goals: Goal 1: Investigate distributed algorithms in the presence of harmful hosts;Goal 2: Investigate distributed algorithms in an unsafe network using the mobile faults model.;Goal 3: Develop a testable model for the validation of distributed algorithms in an unsafe network. Goal 1 specifically focuses on networks with harmful hosts. We are particularly interested in solutions that constrain as much as possible the requirements imposed on agents and network (in order to maximize the feasibility of the realization of such solutions on actual networks supporting agents). More specifically, we aim for algorithms that are as efficient as possible while not requiring loosely constrained (possibly unrealistic) mechanisms. All work pertaining to Goal 1 is rooted in the use of the processor failure model, that is, a model in which faults are localized in nodes of the network. In contrast, Goal 2 adopts the more general mobile faults model. Goal 2 is two-fold: a) investigate how to adapt distributed algorithms that use the processor failure model in an unsafe network to instead use the mobile faults model and b) develop new efficient distributed algorithms in unsafe networks that adopt the mobile faults model. Finally, Goal 3 addresses the testing of distributed algorithms in unsafe networks.","Distributed computing with mobile agents in unsafe networks","Information, computer and communication technologies",CANADA,CANADA,"Distributed and parallel processing"

We will use two laser-based ionization methods, i.e., vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) single-photon ionization (SPI) and laser induced electron impact ionization (LIEI), coupled with time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) to identify the nature of the gas-phase film growth precursors and to determine the chemical kinetics that govern their formation. Laser spectroscopic techniques, including resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) and zero kinetic energy (ZEKE) photoelectron/mass analyzed threshold ionization (MATI), will be used to characterize the structure, bonding and energetic properties of gaseous silicon carbide (SixCy) and silicon nitride (SinNm) clusters. This will help develop highly sensitive and selective diagnostic method for these reactive species and contribute to the understanding of growth mechanisms since these gaseous clusters can be viewed as prototypes for the interactions of carbon and nitrogen atoms with silicon sites at surfaces. We will also characterize the structural and compositional changes of the silicon carbide and silicon nitride thin films prepared using different source gases and various deposition parameters. The results will be correlated with those from our studies of gas-phase chemistry using laser ionization mass spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques for a complete picture of the growth processes, both in the gas-phase and on the substrate surfaces. The proposed research will provide importance guidance towards an efficient and rational optimization of film formation in HWCVD to obtain superior quality silicon-conatining thin films for industrial applications.

"The D"" layer is located at 200-300 km above core-mantle boundary and is regarded as one of the most mysterious regions in the Earth. The D"" layer is a potential graveyard of ancient oceanic plates and the buffer layer between lower mantle and outer core.  Hence, the D"" layer is characterized by chemical heterogeneity and thermal anomalies. The recently discovered post-perovskite phase is the high-pressure form of perovskite phase and may be the most abundant phase within the D"" layer. Therefore, knowledge of the physical properties and chemical compositions of the post-perovskite phase is important to model deep mantle convection and dynamics of the Earth. In this proposal, the structure and elasticity of Fe- and Al-bearing post-perovskite phase will be systematically examined at lower mantle P-T conditions. In a separate but related mantle study, the radial x-ray diffraction method, together with lattice strength theory, will be employed to study mixed mantle phases and to provide a wealth of new information under high-pressure and high temperature conditions. Finally, the electronic structures of planetary materials are an important key to identify the stable phases in planetary interiors and help to understand the structural variations under extreme condition, which is fundamentally important. To achieve those goals the high-pressure diamond-anvil cell, together with the first custom-built high-temperature laser-heating  diamond-anvil cell system in Canada which is currently being set up, will be used for these experimental investigations. The results obtained in this proposal will be of great help in providing insights into the structure of planetary materials and to model the structure and dynamics of the Earth and other planets.

"Today, with the rapid growth in the world's energy consumption, photovoltaics, a technology that converts light

directly into electricity, provides a much-needed green power solution and has experienced an explosive

expansion. Central to this development is a low-cost and high-efficiency solar cell. In this project, we propose

to develop novel solar cells utilizing III-V and I-III-VI semiconductor nanostructures, that can significantly

enhance the conversion efficiency for photons with energy from 1.0 to 1.2 eV, a spectral range in which current

devices exhibit very poor efficiency. We will first investigate the Bridgman growth of high quality large-area

CuInxGa1-xSe2 crystals, a technology that has been carried out in our laboratory since the 1980s. We will then

study the passivation of CuInxGa1-xSe2 surfaces and solar cells, with the objective to achieve an efficiency of

more than 17% under AM1.5 conditions. In parallel, we will investigate the growth and characteristics of

InGaAs metamorphic and InAs quantum dot heterostructures, with an effective energy bandgap in the range of

1.0 to 1.2 eV, on both silicon and CuInxGa1-xSe2 substrates. We propose to demonstrate high efficiency

(>28%) single-junction solar cells on silicon and CuInxGa1-xSe2 substrates under AM1.5 conditions, which

will form the key element for the integration with existing technologies to potentially realize next generation

ultrahigh efficiency multi-junction devices. During the final phase of the project, a quadruple-junction solar

cell, comprising of CuInxGa1-xSe2, InGaAs metamorphic, InAs quantum dot intermediate band, and InGaP

cells, will be monolithically grown, fabricated, and characterized.

Combining the PIs' demonstrated expertise in III-V and I-III-VI semiconductors and solar cells, as well as the

industrial proven experience in solar cells of Spectra-Nova Technologies, ICP Solar Technologies, and the Fox

Group Inc., this project is advantageously positioned to address some of the fundamental materials and device

"Wide-spread commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) for use in vehicles and portable electronics is presently very costly due to fuel cell inefficiency. The foremost target in this research area is new ion transporting materials (electrolytes) that can conduct protons above 100 ï¿½C. The higher temperature enhances the reaction rates of the electrodes and diminishes poisoning effects on the catalysts greatly enhancing fuel cell performance. Unfortunately, the vast majority of electrolyte materials, which are based on polymer materials, rely on water as the proton carrier and so lose function upon dehydration. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of materials characterized by having regular arrays of pores on the size scale of single molecules.

The Shimizu group has found that lining the pores in MOFs with acidic sites can form solids that can transfer protons both with water and with less volatile molecules as proton carriers. Importantly, these MOFs can conduct protons at 150 ï¿½C in the absence of any hydration. The present proposal makes systematic advances to the first generation MOFs to enhance the proton conduction, operating temperature ceiling and stability to fuel cell conditions of these materials.

"A community of plant species consists of all those species occurring together in an area small enough to allow individuals of these species to interact.  The ""rules"" that determine which species will not be found together, which will be found together, and which of these species will be dominant or rare, are termed ""assembly rules"".  The objective of this research program is to test and refine a mathematical model that I have previously developed that specifies these assembly rules in mathematical form.  The model uses a method from statistical physics (Maximum Entropy Formalism) using community-averaged values of plant functional traits.  These average traits are derived from the principle of natural selection and from quantitative genetics.  One important extension of the model is to extend it to ecosystem processes such as decomposition rates, carbon cycling and nutrient leeching.  As such, this proposed synthetic research program incorporates methods and results from physiological and functional ecology, from statistical physics (Maximum Entropy Formalism), from quantitative genetics, and from community ecology. When completed, it will provide quantitative predictions of community and ecosystem processes.

"Fifty years ago, most people believed that we had successfully defeated all bacterial infections and that the cure

for cancer was just around the corner. In more recent times however, increasing numbers of infections and

tumours are showing resistance to the drugs that are most commonly used. This has started a race where we

work to discover new drugs faster than resistance can develop to the old ones. In this proposal I will study a

new way to generate drug candidates.

There are currently two traditional routes to finding bioactive molecules to use as drug candidates. The most

common method involves the extraction and purification of compounds from natural sources. Chemical

synthesis of novel compounds, or derivatives of natural products, is the second main source.

An alternative method that would result in the production of novel compounds would be by modification of

one or more biosynthetic genes involved in the production of an interesting structure to generate structural

analogues. Since the parent molecule has demonstrated bioactivity, the odds are greater for generating other

bioactive compounds by this method. Often the genes are already present in, or can be expressed in, an easily

culturable microorganism making the production of the compound inexpensive.

In this study, I propose to generate mutants in the asukamycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces

nodosus spp asukaensis, rendering it unable to produce the starter unit to the ""upper"" portion of the molecule.

Feeding of analogues of this starter unit will result in the production of a variety of novel compounds to use in

drug screening assays. Asukamycin is an excellent candidate for a mutasynthesis study in that the CoA ligase

required for priming the polyketide synthase with the starter unit has been demonstrated to have low substrate

specificity. It has also been shown that the manumycin family of antibiotics, of which asukamycin is a

member, has a wide range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antitumour, and antiinflammatory

responses.","Mutasynthesis of asukamycin analogues","Human pharmaceuticals",CANADA,CANADA,"Bio-organic chemistry"
"High Definition channels and large flat panel LCD and Plasma TVs are invading consumer market and consumers expect high quality, sharp images. Conversion of Standard Definition (SD) images into good quality High Definition images is now a central issue for broadcast and television industries. High Definition broadcast channels need to convert existing Standard Definition archives, films, advertising into HD format. Moreover, online video is experiencing tremendous growth including purchased or rented videos, advertisement-supported professional content and user-generated video. Most online videos today are low

resolution and low quality, diminishing their entertainment value. The tremendous challenge of converting ST and Internet video to HD is to compute missing pixels of HD images from pixels of the input SD image. Signal processing techniques can be employed to obtain a high-resolution image from multiple low-resolution images. Recently, such a resolution enhancement approach, called super-resolution image reconstruction, has been a very active research area. A high quality solution to the super resolution problem has to take advantage

of the recent advances in image processing. In the last few years a new class of image representations has been introduced. Examples of these new multi-directional, multi-resolution image representations are ridgelet, bandlet and contourlet. These image representations have shown very promising results for some image processing applications and seem to have great potential for solving other image processing problems. Our

main objective in this research is to develop a contourlet-based super-resolution algorithm for HDTV applications. The outcome of the proposed research will be a set of algorithms that can be used to convert an SD source to a detailed, sharp set of HD images.

"3D imaging and broadcasting technologies have drawn a great deal of attention from the industry and the research community, and represent an important future growth area of digital media industry and services. These technologies aim to offer consumers much enhanced and immersive experience in watching videos, and therefore could lead to a multitude of new multimedia applications for education, medicine, surveillance and entertainment. One way to achieve 3D imaging is to use multi-view video (MVV), where the system uses several cameras to acquire multiple video sequences of the same scene simultaneously. The data are then compressed and transmitted to the users. In this project, we will study and develop algorithms for multi-view video coding, 3D modeling, multi-view video processing and analysis, and multi-view based resolution enhancement. In particular we will devise compression algorithm(s) capable of removing all three types of redundancies in MVV sequences: intraframe, interframe and inter-view. Also, for the transmission of MVV via heterogeneous networks our MVV codec will be made scalable. Existing MVV systems require dedicated camera arrays and the corresponding expensive controlling hardware and software, making the mass deployment of these systems difficult and impractical, especially in the consumer markets. In this project, we propose a low-cost user-driven client-server alternative to these high-end 3D systems that can provide some basic multi-view video functionalities. The spatial, temporal and perspective redundancies in multi-view video suggest a great potential of improving video quality by superresolution techniques.  Through motion estimation and geometric warping we can register multiple views in subpixel precision and upsample each of these views to a higher spatial resolution.   We will formulate and investigate a new inverse problem for multi-view superresolution reconstruction, and develop an algorithm to solve the problem. This project will result in the development of new scientific knowledge and perhaps intellectual property that could ultimately be commercialized. Another important aspect of the project will be the development of highly qualified personnel.

"Disorders in the human musculoskeletal system affect majority of population and are the leading cause of disability in people during their active working years. Although the etiology of many of these disorders (e.g., low-back pain, arthritis) is often a matter of uncertainty, there is ample evidence suggesting that mechanical factors play a prominent role. Identification of the role of these factors in observed injuries, deformities and degenerative processes benefits broad segments of the society by improving quality of life and productivity to reducing health care cost especially in our ageing society. This proposal aims to perform realistic finite element model studies of the redundant human passive-active trunk system, single- and multi-motion segment lumbar spine, intervertebral discs, passive-active human knee joint including tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints in intact and reconstructed conditions, articular cartilage and joint replacement materials. These models perform 3D coupled nonlinear diffusion, elasto-static, dynamic, viscoelastic and poroelastic analyses under various mechanical loading, muscle recruitments and postural/kinematics/boundary conditions. Our own in-house developed programs as well as commercially available package programs (e.g., Abaqus) will be used to carry out the proposed studies. The foregoing biomechanical model studies in combination with in vivo/in vitro measurements (done by us, our collaborators or taken from the literature) will: (1) markedly advance our understanding of functional biomechanics and stability of the human trunk, knee joints and their components as well as associated injuries, failures and degenerative processes; (2) suggest methods and standards for safe and optimal performance of occupational/recreational tasks; (3) investigate and improve current exercise, evaluation and rehabilitation programs as well as surgical replacement methods and finally (4) analyse and improve designs for prosthetic replacement systems.","Model studies in orthopaedic biomechanics","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,Biomechanics
"This research aims at development of advanced data management techniques, which uses and/or extends existing database theory and technology for modeling data and processing queries required in numerous emerging applications. Examples of such data includes logical data, uncertainty data, web logs, sequence data, etc. Our focus is on logical data and sequence data. We consider logical data in information integration and study query rewriting and evaluation of conjunctive queries using views, where the queries and views are logical rules possibly extended with constraints which are linear arithmetic comparisons. Literature discusses attribute comparisons and for certain classes of connstraints practical solutions are developed to find maximally contained rewritings, when exists, for queries with all but inequality comparisons. We will develop constraints resolution and optimization modules for the rewriting algoritms in our context above. This extends our results in CoopIS 2005, where we considered constraints which are linear arithmetic expressions with equality.

In another research theme in this proposal, we investigate modeling and processing sequence data, which do not have any structure. Emerging applications generate and use enormous amounts of such data. We focus more on biological sequences: DNA and proteins. The main issues are the required uge storage space and lengthy process of index construction. Further, efficient support for exact match and approximate searching is central to such applications. Hence a desired solution should be space efficient, scalable, with resonable index construction time and efficient various search tecniques. While string searching is not new, the enormous size of ever-growing biological sequences, and the variety and volume of queries to be supported pose new research challenges. There is a growing need for more sophisicated indexing structures and techniques. Based on our results in CIKM 2005, the expected contributions of this work include both theoretical and practical advances in the management of biological sequence data.

"High Definition Teleconferencing (HDTC) can be thought of as teleconferencing where the video is of High Definition Television (HDTV) quality; i.e., 1920x1080 pixels frame size at 30 frames per second progressive scan, commonly referred to as 1080P. HDTC will significantly improve the quality of teleconferencing in terms of presence, awareness, realism, and details, providing a rich user experience. While some attention has been devoted to this topic, many challenges are yet to be overcome before true tele-presence can be achieved with HDTC. In addition to high bandwidth and high processing power requirements, HDTC also needs to address issues such as adaptation to network conditions, intelligent context and content awareness, automated videography, Quality of Service (QoS) limitations, multicasting, and heterogeneity of some of the receiving devices. These issues become specially challenging for HDTC, due to the very high processing speed and computational power drawn by HD video. In this proposed NSERC CRD research, we will work with the Ottawa-based Magor Communications Corporation to address the above research issues and to design and develop CAVIAR: a context aware videography and adaptation system for high definition videoconferencing. Magor has developed an HDTC application that has been successfully field-tested and is now being offered as a commercial product. Our approach will be to use this application as the nucleus of the research prototype, and to architect, design, implement, and test a number of solutions for the research challenges inherent in this application. As a result of the research proposed here, new knowledge and expertise in the area of high definition videoconferencing, HDTV, automated videography, media adaptation, and context aware synthesis will be generated. In addition, the research will produce beneficial and important technology that is immediately transferrable to the Canadian industry, enabling our industrial partner and other companies in Canada to be among the first to go to market and stay competitive in this field, which in turn allows Canada to continue to be a leader in the area of information and communications technology.

"Massively Multiuser Virtual Environments (MMVE) set out to create an environment for thousands, tens of thousands, or even millions of users to simultaneously interact with each other as in the real world. Interestingly, and to some extent counter-intuitively due to inherent technical challenges, it is this massiveness that has made MMVEs more successful than traditional virtual environments which could only support about a dozen simultaneous users interacting in real time. For example, Massively Multiuser Online Games (MMOGs), now a very profitable sector of the industry and subject to academic and industry research, is a special case of MMVEs where hundreds of thousands of players simultaneously interact with each other. Although originally designed for gaming, MMOGs are now widely used for socializing, business, commerce, scientific experimentation, and many other practical purposes, and are among the few industries unaffected by the global economic downturn. One could say that MMOGs are the ""killer app"" that brings MMVEs into the realm of eSociety. In parallel, haptics, has emerged as a new media that will significantly change the way human-human and human-computer interaction is done. The potential of haptics technology is highly significant and can affect fields as diverse as modeling & animation, geophysical analysis, medical training, virtual museums, engineering design and planning, surgical simulations, tele-operation and control of scientific instruments, gaming, and robotic manipulation in hazardous environments. The impact of haptics becomes even more significant when networking is added to it, called tele-haptics, and used in human to human communication, collaboration, and tele-operation using the sense of touch. Beyond the obvious extension to remote collaboration, however, recasting haptics as an intrinsically networked technology allows reconsideration of the entire architectural model for CVEs and MMVEs. This research sets out to design and implement an architecture called MASSIVE GAIN that could be used as a platform for interaction among massive number of users, not just through conventional audio/visual media, but also through high fidelity haptic media.

"The first half of this project deals with the structure and properties of simple rings, mathematical objects that are of fundamental importance in many branches of pure mathematics, as well as in applications to other areas of science. One of the goals of this project, for example, is to gain a precise understanding of projective representations of groups - important tools in such areas of science as the study of the structure of atoms and crystals, and solid-state physics.  



The second half of this project deals with the theory of coagulation/fragmentation. This theory was discovered almost a century ago as a result of the chemical study of the formation of polymers. It has found numerous practical practical applications in science and engineering, ranging from oil extraction, manufacture of plastics, dispersion of hazardous materials, and hematology, to theories of planet and galaxy formation. Our group has been investigating the behavior of systems of particles which grow and decline by clustering or splitting apart (such as radioactive dust inside a damaged reactor, or gas bubbles forming in underground oil tables). The way such systems develop over time, and in particular the way external factors influence their evolution, is the focus of our research. The practical applications include the ability not only to predict the behavior of such systems, but to control that behavior.

"My research expertise is in the kinetic theory and hydrodynamics of systems far from thermal equilibrium. The theoretical models are based on transport equations for the velocity distribution functions of different species and/or the hydrodynamic equations for the lower order moments of the distribution function namely the density, mean flow and temperature. The physical systems considered include the energization of ions in gases by external electromagnetic fields, the relaxation of energetic particles created in the laboratory or that occur in the atmosphere, the escape of planetary atmospheres,  the kinetic theory of granular materials and reaction-diffusion models for excitable systems directed towards the study cardiac arrhythmias. The nonequilibrium neutral and ionized systems are modeled with kinetic theory based on the Boltzmann and/or Fokker-Planck equations. Fundamental aspects of these relaxation processes are considered as well as the interpretation of laboratory experiments such as Doppler spectroscopy. Pseudospectral methods are generally the method of choice for the solution of the appropriate model equations and the further development of these numerical methods is an ongoing research activity. I am planning to apply these methods to two-dimensional problems such as reactive systems governed by a Kramers equation and the calculation of the vibrational states in some triatomic molecules  The Kramers equation models a reactive system coupled to an equilibrium background characterized by a viscosity or a collision frequency.  The problem is thus analogous to a similar problem in rarefied gas dynamics for which solutions are sought for all degrees of rarefaction, that is, for all collision frequencies. Occasionally, Monte Carlo methods are used in the simulation of the systems described above.  I am also proposing further work on the resolution of the Gibb's phenomenon and the analysis of images in applied science and tomography. Many aspects of the research described here have practical applications to medicine and industry.

"In this application, funding is requested for a system that can guide the placement of neural recording devices using a procedure known as 'neuro-navigation'. This system makes use of images of the brain obtained using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners, of the type commonly available in hospitals. MRI images are used that describe both the anatomical structure of the brain (structural MRI), and its activity in response to external sensory stimuli (functional MRI), such as pictures of objects. The neuro-navigation system registers images of the brain using an internal coordinate system, which is specified by a reference device attached to the head during an MRI scan. This reference device is visible in the MRI images. Subsequent to the scan, the system can help guide the insertion of neural probes into specific brain sites, as selected by a researcher from the given MRI images. In order to guide implantation, the system aligns the MRI coordinate system to the physical space of the operating room using infra-red light, which is projected back from the reference device. The device is attached to the head in the same position as it was in the MRI scanner, thus it can be used as the link to align the new physical space to the MRI images. Similar systems are used in neurosurgical suites, for MRI guidance of neurosurgical procedures. The system will allow my laboratory to probe brain activity in our continuing investigation of how the visual brain areas function. It will also allow us to accurately position probes in specific brain sites while studying the mechanisms underlying brain imaging signals, research that has applications in pure science and in diagnostics of neurological diseases. Furthermore, it will allow us to accurately position coils used to stimulate specific brain sites non-invasively with magnetic fields. We use these coils while studying the mechanisms underlying magnetic stimulation of the brain, research that has applications in pure science and in therapy of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Lastly, we intend to improve upon current neuro-navigation techniques, which will be beneficial to researchers who use it in studies of brain and cognition, to clinical neurosurgeons and the Canadian health system as a whole.","An neuronavigation system for structural and functional MRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation and neurophysiological recordings in non-human primates",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Sensory systems and perception"
"The equipment requested in this application is a fast camera system optimized for optical imaging of the brain using special solutions. The molecules of the solutions adhere to the cells in the brain, and emanate light that changes with changes in activity of these cells. The requested system will be combined with an already existing camera system that is capable of imaging blood flow in the brain. This combination will create the first imaging system capable of recording blood signals and brain activity simultaneously. This novel system will support several research programs, all of which are in the field of understanding how brain activity and blood flow in the brain interact. One program seeks to understand this relation under resting condition, when no sensory stimuli or tasks are presented to the subject. A second program investigates the role of different cell types in coordinating the interaction between brain activity and blood flow. A third program will use the system in order to investigate how EEG brain waves are related to blood signals. The fourth program will test existing mathematical models of the interaction between brain activity and blood flow using data obtained by the system.","Spatio-temporal simultaneous measurements of neurophysiological and hemodynamics signals using dual methods of optical imaging",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Sensory systems and perception"
"Visual or auditory stimuli presented to human subjects evoke increases in brain activity in the visual or auditory parts of the brain, respectively. These and other similar phenomena indicate that specific regions in the brain are specialized for processing specific information. The areas with specific function are connected via a dense network of connections, through which they communicate. The code through which brain areas communicate is largely unknown.

Modern Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanners are capable of detecting increases in neuronal activity in an indirect manner. These scanners are capable of detecting changes in blood flow. Since increases in brain activity draw more blood to the active regions of the brain, these increases in blood flow can be detected by the scanners, and interpreted as increases in brain activity. This method is termed 'functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging' (fMRI). 

In the currently proposed program, we will investigate the code through which brain areas communicate. We will detect areas with specific function in the visual brain by presenting visual stimuli and measuring activity with functional MRI. We will then guide measurements of electrical activity in the brain to the active sites detected by functional MRI. We expect that the guidance by functional MRI will enable precise measurement of neuronal activity, which will allow us to reveal mechanisms of communication between areas of the visual brain. 

The results of the proposed experiments may potentially reveal mechanisms of communication between areas in the brain. The findings may inspire development of sophisticated artificial communication systems based on models of neural networks. Importantly, the findings may serve as the basis for understanding malfunction of communication between brain regions in psychiatric and neurological diseases, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.

"The sympathetic nervous system is an important regulator of moment-by-moment changes in blood pressure through changes in vascular contractile state.  This system emits bursts of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) consisting of multiple neurons discharging at more-or-less the same time. This research program tests the working hypothesis that the discharge patterns of SNA variously impact vasomotor control through the differential release of multiple neurotransmitters. The major objectives are: 1) Quantify the coded patterns of neuronal action potentials present within integrated bursts of SNA, their reflex-specificity, and their species-specificity. Wavelet denoising methods and other Matlab-based algorithms will be used to expose and characterize individual action potentials in the multi-unit nerve recordings. 2) Establish the receptor-based mechanisms that differentially affect the mechanical properties of the vascular tree in skeletal muscle. Using a modified Windkessel model, the lumped parameters of resistance, compliance, viscoelasticity and inertia will be measured in the skeletal muscle of the human forearm and the rat hindlimb during reflexive manoeuvres along with their receptor-based mechanism of control. 3) Quantify the impact of physiologically relevant SNA discharge patterns on vasomotor mechanics and their post-junctional receptor-based mechanism of control, emphasizing baroreflex versus muscle chemoreflex activation. We will simulate patterns of SNA action potentials that replicate SNA bursts of varying sizes, groupings, and inter-burst spacing. These will be played back into the femoral nerve of an anesthetized rodent and the impact on receptor-based changes in vascular resistance and compliance will be measured. The experiments will provide novel and innovative approaches to examine the manner in which sympathetic neurons communicate with blood vessels to exert short-, and longer-term vascular control. These studies embrace integrative animal physiology and offer a unique opportunity for scientific discovery and for training of highly qualified personnel.","Sympathetic neural discharge patterns, co-transmitters and neurovascular control","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal circulation"
"The primary aim of this research is to develop models to predict the evolution with time of industrially and environmentally important materials corrosion processes. Key areas of interest include corrosion of important materials in high level nuclear waste repositories and gas transmission pipeline steels. The primary goal of an environmental performance assessment model is the demonstration that the chosen scenario will meet the set regulatory goals. The primary goal of an industrial corrosion model is to either demonstrate that the system is fit to remain in service or to optimize the scheduling of maintenance operations for minimal process disturbance. In the majority of these applications oxide films and/or corrosion product deposits on the surface of the materials are the primary defense against corrosion. A thorough understanding of their properties and how they respond with time and exposure environment is essential if their use is to be justified. The primary focus of this proposal is the experimental development of the necessary mechanistic understanding and the determination of the values of essential model parameters. It is proposed that all aspects of localized corrosion processes be studied, from the properties of the films and deposits which must fail for localized processes to initiate, to the development of damage functions for specific corrosion processes, which describe how damage accumulates over the important exposure period. This will be achieved by coupling electrochemical techniques, which have a long history of application to these problems, with a range of novel surface analytical techniques which we have developed or adapted to these applications over the past few years. These include the novel coupling of electrochemical methods and neutron reflectometry and the adaptation of scanning electrochemical microscopy, a technique which can map inhomogeneously distributed corrosion sites.","Electrochemical studies of general and localized corrosion processes","Physical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,Electrochemistry

"Advanced biomaterial design is critical to targeting diseased tissue.  Understanding the interplay between biomaterial design and targeting capacity requires thorough characterization of the nano-sized biomaterials.  Whether based on inorganic or organic materials, the novel nanoparticles created and studied in the laboratories of Molly Shoichet, Mitchell Winnik, Raymond Reilly and Walid Houry must be described in terms of their physical size, which is provided by dynamic light scattering, and their surface charge, which is provided by zetapotential.  The information obtained from the combined dynamic light scattering / zetapotential instrument will allow us to advance knowledge key to our knowledge-based economy, particularly in the fields of targeted drug delivery and imaging in cancer and proteins at the cell surface called molecular chaperones.  



The multidisciplinary fields of biomedical and chemical engineering, chemistry, pharmacy and biochemistry are represented in the proposed infrastructure and will benefit over 100 researchers in the combined laboratories of the investigators and their collaborators.  Importantly, the proposed dynamic light scattering / zetapotentiometry instrument has become a mainstay of the modern laboratory and without which our progress has slowed and even led to incorrect analyses.

"Regenerative Medicine holds tremendous promise for overcoming diseases and disorders that the body cannot

heal on its own. By combining tissue engineering with stem cell biology strategies, we propose to create an

artificial retina that will be available for transplantation to restore vision when it is lost due to disease or

degeneration.

This proposal advances exciting research at the interface of engineering and medicine. We will build on our

fundamental invention that combines advanced laser technology with photochemically activated hydrogels to

create 3-dimensional, chemically patterned hydrogel scaffolds. These hydrogels will mimic the laminar

structure present in the retina and have specific factors immobilized in defined volumes that will preferentially

guide and differentiate retinal stem cells to the four main cell types of the retina that are required to process and

produce signals. By incorporating endothelial precursor cells into the scaffold design, we will achieve a

vascularized retina tissue analog where the nascent blood vessels will ensure cell and tissue survival. We will

test the tissue engineered retina for function in vitro and for biocompatibility and cell survival in vivo.

Our multidisciplinary team is poised for success in this challenging project that combines engineering,

photochemistry, stem cell biology, electrophysiology and animal studies. Each team member brings the

complementary expertise that is required to achieve the proposed goals. The HQP trained in this project will

benefit from the diverse expertise and the consequent breadth of training received. With a view toward

translation, the team is supported by an industrial partner who will work with us to patent and commercialize

inventions derived herein. Together we aim to advance the underlying science required in tissue engineering to

restore vision.

"Polymeric biomaterials have been designed with great success for applications in medicine and this has spurred the fields of drug delivery and tissue engineering, where polymers are being specifically engineered to engage the cells within the body.  My research laboratory at the University of Toronto has been specifically focused on designing polymers to influence cellular activity.  These include projects in both: tissue engineering where polymeric scaffolds are engineered to enhance cell survival, differentiation and tissue formation; and drug delivery where biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles are designed to specifically kill tumorigenic cells.  For the scaffolds project, a novel three-dimensional patterning approach is proposed that advances chemical patterning of hydrogels to spatially guide stem cell differentiation.  Here the focus is on the engineering design strategy of the 3D scaffold.  For the drug delivery project, novel biodegradable polymeric nanospheres are proposed which can be specifically modified to target cancerous cells.  Here the focus is on the polymer synthesis and the nanoparticle processing.  While the projects are disctinct, the program is unified by advances in fundamental polymer science and engineering in the context of tissue engineering and drug delivery.  These comprise two key areas strength in Canada and have been identified by the Federal government as priorities in Canada for investment.  The high quality personnel supported herein will gain critical skills and develop innovations that will contribute to the global knowledge-based economy of the 21st century.

"The outermost translucent layers of a star comprise the star's atmosphere, and is the part of the star that 

we can observe most directly.  The primary observational data that we have for studying the atmosphere is 

the spectrum of the light emitted by the star.  The physics of how the spectrum is determined by the 

structure of the atmosphere is sufficiently complex that we can only extract information about the star by 

computational modelling of the atmosphere and the spectrum.  It follows that the accuracy with which the 

atmospheric structure is inferred depends on the physical realism of the computational modelling.  Due to 

limitations in computational power and numerical methodology, models to date have been somewhat 

unrealistic approximations to actual stellar atmospheres.  I propose to make improvements to a number of 

areas of realism in stellar atmosphere and spectrum modelling, including the geometry and horizontal 

structure of the atmosphere, the treatment of the thermodynamic state of the gas and radiation field, the 

inclusion of outflows (winds), and the realism with which atoms absorb, then re-emit, photons.  This is an

ambitious program, but the approach will emphasize making approximate improvements in some of these 

areas while making more realistic improvements in others of them to study the net combined effect of 

improvement in several areas at once.  These improvements are especially relevant to the study of 

relatively cool stars such as the Sun and red giants.  There are two broad scientific problems that will be 

addressed: 1) Increasing the accuracy with which the chemical composition is spectroscopically determined 

for very old red giant stars that trace remote global structures in our Galaxy, the understanding of which 

will help elucidate the history of structure formation and chemical element synthesis in the Universe, and 

2) The structure of the mysterious dramatic temperature inversion that is found in the outer atmosphere of 

the Sun and most cool stars, the understanding of which will reveal physical processes that occur in such 

stellar atmospheres that are currently unknown.

"As the major primary producers in aquatic environments, phytoplankton play a fundamental role in aquatic food webs and influence global chemical cycles. Besides nourishing the vast majority of aquatic life, phytoplankton remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by converting it into organic carbon; a significant portion of the organic material produced by marine phytoplankton sinks out of the surface waters into the deep ocean where it remains isolated from the atmosphere for hundreds, or thousands of years. The discovery that viruses are abundant in aquatic environments, and that many phytoplankton species are susceptible to virus infection suggests that viruses are an important source of phytoplankton mortality that may influence aquatic food webs and global chemical cycles. Despite the growing scientific interest in aquatic viruses, empirical data directly demonstrating the effects of viruses on phytoplankton populations and communities is extremely limited. Therefore, the long-term objectives of my research are to determine if aspects of phytoplankton-virus ecology are predictable, and if the effects of viruses need to be included in models of primary production and phytoplankton ecology. These long-term objectives will be accomplished by working towards four specific objectives that focus on poorly described, but critical topics in phytoplankton-virus ecology. The specific objectives are: 1) to determine the biodiversity and seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton viruses in different freshwater environments, 2) to quantify the relative importance of viruses to phytoplankton mortality, 3) to determine if viruses influence phytoplankton competition, and 4) to determine if environmental conditions influence phytoplankton susceptibility and resistance to virus infection. Ultimately, this work will develop and promote advanced research technologies for aquatic microbiology, and will increase our understanding the role of phytoplankton in global chemical cycles by enabling more accurate, realistic models of phytoplankton ecology and aquatic primary production.

"Galls are atypical, organ-like growths on plants caused by specialized insects that have evolved the ability to control the growth of plants to the insect's advantage. Only the insects gain in the association as they are surrounded by thick layers of cells that provide food and shelter. Several kinds of insects induce plant galls as part of their life history strategies, but the most common and diverse are midges and gall wasps. Most gall wasps attack oaks and wild roses and each species induces a structurally distinct gall. Wasps of the genus Diplolepis are restricted to inducing galls on wild roses. There are about 42 species of Diplolepis in the world and 13 in Canada with galls that vary in size from small pea-like structures on leaves to large swellings the size of golf balls on stems. Studying the anatomy and development of galls provides a novel tool for understanding how plants control their own development. Galls represent discrete microhabitats that support closed communities of specialist inhabitants and the ease by which galls can be collected, their occupants observed and counted, and the interactions among them inferred, make them useful study systems in subject areas ranging from population dynamics to the evolution and zoogeography of animal communities. Studying gall communities from southern Canada to the tree line in the NWT and northern Ontario provides insight into how flora and fauna moved into Canada following glaciation. They also provide an opportunity to study how global warming is allowing both roses and the gall insects associated with them to move further northward. Some domestic roses, such as Rosa rugosa, have become weeds in eastern Canada, the USA, and Europe, and two of the Diplolepis gallers found in Ontario are being considered as agents for their biological control.

"The proposed research is related a number of practical applications in the power and metal processing industries where the simultaneous flow of liquid and vapour is encountered, e.g. heat exchangers, refrigeration equipment and power plants. The proposed research program is concerned with developing methodologies, and understanding the underlying physics, for designing and evaluating the performance of engineering equipment involving heat transfer and fluid flow. 



Three particular problems are of interest. The first involves the cooling of hot surfaces in the metal processing industry. This is achieved by impinging cold liquid jets on the hot surface. An experimental apparatus is designed to carry out a range of experiments aimed at obtaining results in support the design and performance optimization of such a cooling system. The second project involves predicting the performance of industrial systems where liquid and gas flow simultaneously in large pipes. The results are relevant to the accurate prediction of the performance and safety of large-scale engineering systems encountered in power plants. The third project is concerned with increasing the effectiveness of heat exchange equipment. By applying high voltage-low current electric field to a fluid flowing in a conduit, additional fluid motion is created causing fluid mixing and as such increasing the heat transfer rate. Increasing the heat transfer rate allows the development of more compact heat exchange equipment for a variety of applications.



An important aspect of the proposed research program is the training of highly qualified personnel. We expect eight graduate students and three postdoctoral fellows to be trained through the proposed program.

"Digital signal processing (DSP) enables many technologies that are in widespread use including cellular telephones, wireless data networks, digital audio, digital video, speech coding, voice and video compression, etc.  In data networking applications, DSP is used to reduce the effects of noise, interference, and signal distortion so that higher data rates can be achieved along with lower error rates.  In compression applications, DSP is used to analyze and modify signals and thereby reduce the number of bytes required to store or transmit the signal.  In audio and video equipment, DSP is used to enhance the perceived quality of the signal.



This proposal requests support for an ongoing research program that includes the optimal design of the digital filters that are used in these applications.

"We study so-called Frobenius manifolds - objects endowed with a rich and nonstandard geometrical structure. Originally arising in physics, these manifolds now appear in very different areas of mathematics, leading to unexpected relations between them. 

   We propose several directions of research which could contribute to the current understanding of such relations. In particular, we plan to exploit the link between Frobenius manifolds and the theory of random matrix ensembles which has applications in many areas of mathematics and in the theory of interacting particle systems. We plan to use this link to bring the technique developed in Frobenius manifold theory over to the theory of random matrix ensembles.

"Pacific salmon must undergo a remarkable transformation to maintain internal equilibrium as they migrate between fresh- and seawater. The change from stream dwelling parr to migratory smolt is characterized by a complex series of developmental events that prepare fish for entry into seawater. Hormonal changes in response to springtime increases in daylight and temperature stimulate the physiological phenomenon known as smolting. We know considerably less about the physiological changes that occur in maturing adult salmon as they migrate back to freshwater. Among and within species, the mechanisms for maintaining internal salt balance are similar. There is considerable variation, however, in the age, size and timing of migration between seawater and freshwater. This variability in life history traits provides a mechanism for fish to exploit new habitats or respond to rapid changes in their environment that occur naturally or due to human disturbance. The role genetics plays in the physiological adaptations that allow salmon to exploit new, or survive in disturbed habitats, is not well understood. The objective of the proposed research is to compare physiological performance of salmon from divergent geographic regions and examine their growth, development and survival under environmental conditions to which they are naturally adapted. In addition, changes in physical factors will be used to assess performance among different populations. A further approach for these investigations will be to alter the genotype through the creation of families from different populations of salmon and by modifying ploidy. The investigation of environmental, developmental and genetic bases of phenotypic expression is a novel approach to understanding the mechanisms controlling ion balance in salmon. The proposed work will provide insight into the ability of salmonids that differ genetically to respond to changes in the environment. In addition, there are a number of practical applications to this work. Understanding the interactions between genetic and environmental factors will benefit selection of strains for re-establishment of wild runs and for aquaculture production.","Environmental and genetic factors affecting physiological performance in salmonids","Environmental impact of economic activities (including agriculture)",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal physiology and metabolism"

"Creativity is essential to engineering design. Objectives of the proposed research are to: 1) develop methods to support creativity during engineering design, and 2) apply these methods to address environmental issues.

     Creativity methods researched entail presenting appropriate stimuli to engineering designers during concept generation. Biological analogies have been especially useful as design stimuli. I developed a method that systematically identifies relevant biological analogies for any given engineering problem. This method searches through natural-language information, e.g., textbooks and research papers, to take advantage of the vast amount of knowledge already in this format. Research objectives to improve this method aim to 1) present search results more concisely so that promising phenomena are not overlooked, 2) incorporate other sources of biological information to expand search space; and 3) improve identification of biologically meaningful keywords, not obviously related to engineering keywords, to enable search results otherwise not possible.

     This biomimetic design approach has been applied to environmental case studies in the past. However, just as technological solutions to environmental problems are required, so too must human behavior align with environmental goals. Although more people are becoming environmentally concerned, social psychologists report that such concern does not necessarily lead to environmentally related behaviors. Therefore, I also aim to identify and address impediments to personal environmentally relevant behavior, specifically in the use of mobility and indoor-temperature control products and services, as these have significant environmental impact. Solutions developed to address environmentally significant behavior will enable an increasing number of people with environmental concern to follow through with environmentally conscious behaviors. It is anticipated that enabling these behaviors through implementation of such solutions will not only encourage other environmentally conscious activities, but also increase the number of people who engage in such activities, thus maximizing the relevance of other technology-based environmentally related research.

"This proposal is centered around two broad themes.



The first theme concerns the construction of theories of computation and complexity which work over the real and complex numbers and are parallel to those of theoretical computer science, but are intended to address the algorithms of scientific computation and numerical analysis. Particular interests are the P versus NP problem of theoretical computer science in this new context and Newton type methods for solving systems of polynomial equations. The condition number and metric play a crucial role. The methodology presents a new paradigm for the solution of problems which may be only approximately solved.



The second theme concerns the prediction and analysis of chaotic behaviour

of dynamical systems, especially the relationship between algebraic topology and

chaos and the extent of validity of statistical robustness as a property of chaotic dynamical systems.



I have been involved with both these themes at least since the 1980's

and expect to be for the indefinite future. In the recent past my work has been divided between these two areas with emphasis on the second. I expect to emphasize the first theme in the coming years although there are still some problems related to the second which interest me and which I may pursue.","Complexity and real number computations and dynamical systems","Mathematical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Pure mathematics"

"This project deals with the development of a new vascular stent device to improve blood flow in coronary arteries which have been affected by arteriosclerosis. Coronary artery disease characterized by a progressive narrowing and blocking of blood vessels, is major cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world and accounts for about a fifth of the deaths in Canada. Angioplasty which is an interventional procedure used for reopening blocked arteries without major surgery is a common and effective procedure to reestablish blood flow in the blocked arteries. In 80% of the cases, a stent or wire mesh is often placed to keep the vessel open following the balloon angioplasty procedure. The major limitation to this effective treatment is the reblockage or restenosis of the stented arteries opened after the initial dilatation procedures. Angioplasty and stenting however, causes damage to the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. We propose a new type of biomedical stenting device which will use nanoparticles containing baculoviruses which carries genes coated on the polymeric membranes. The specific genes will promote the rapid repaving of the damaged arterial lining with natural endothelial cells. The new stent developed is expected to markedly reduce the proliferation of smooth muscles, and therefore, the occurrence of restenosis. This will improve the long-term durability of the stents and also reduce the need for additional interventions or surgery. The development of the new stent would mark a significant advance in the biomedical technologies available for the treatment of cardivascular diseases. A cost effective stent would bring significant benefits to the Canadian healthcare system.","Designing new vascular stents using polymeric membrane containing baculoviruses","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)",CANADA,CANADA,"Medical sciences"
"Research in my lab concerns the origin, maintenance and consequences of biological diversity.  The earth is currently undergoing a crisis of extinction and declining numbers of species at the global scale.  Changes in communities at local scales are often equally dramatic but more variable and context dependent.  The effects of environmental changes are mediated by the complex web of interactions that link species to one another.  We are interested in the forces that shape these interactions, and how these forces depend on the type of habitat.  Diversity is most often represented as the number of species found in a given area; however we can also consider diversity in terms of the range of species traits like size or feeding type, or the evolutionary relationships among the species that live together.  We are performing studies to determine how different kinds of diversity change the way that communities of organisms perform functions such as processing energy or cycling materials.  

Our research is centered on aquatic organisms living in lakes or the ocean.  Aquatic ecosystems are interesting in that the plants at the base of the food web are quite different from those found on land.  Algae are often microscopic and reproduce more quickly than land plants such as trees.  This difference in life form has major consequences for their chemistry that affects whole food webs.  We are studying the effects of differences in the chemistry of algal cells and their environment on the number of species that may coexist.  We are also interested in how the diversity of these micro-organisms affects the sensitivity of communities to changes in the environment like acid rain or warmer temperatures.  We are using long-term sampling of lakes and marine plankton to ask whether more diverse communities are more or less responsive to environmental changes.  The results will help us to understand the importance of diversity of organisms to their collective functioning as ecosystems.

"This research program aims to advance both the fundamental and applied study of electroactive nanostructured graphene devices for chemical and biological sensing applications.  Graphene-based nanostructures are emerging as one of the most powerful classes of new functional nanostructured materials. Graphene is a truly two-dimensional semi-metallic material in which electrons can move without scattering for several hundred nanometers even at room temperature, and more importantly, it's very sensitive to the local environment. The core of this research program will be based on the investigation of the electrical responses of chemical and biological sensors made from (i) receptor sites wired between graphene electrodes, and from (ii) physically adsorbed receptors on graphene flakes. The first part (i) of this project will be based on an efficient process by which graphene sheets can be cut to create molecular-scale (~ 2 nm) gaps. The end cap of the graphene will be functionalized with carboxylic acids that can be used to react with amine-terminated molecular wires (bridges) to reconnect the circuits. The molecular bridges will introduce a reactive site for attachment of biological macromolecules, nanoparticles or small molecules. In the second part (ii), we will take advantage of recent developments in nanotube and nanowire based sensors. Receptor molecules will be attached to graphene through the physisorption of aromatic or polyene anchors. Targets could bind to these sites through complementary chemistry or by guided self-assembly. The electrical response curves of the chemical or biological sensors will be measured using the requested apparatus. Nanofabrication methods will be used to construct these sensors, and the nanofabrication process will be studied using electrical transport, surface sensitive techniques and proximal probes. The proposed work will combine elements of organic chemistry, molecular biology, condensed-matter physics, nanomaterial science, and spectroscopy. The results of this research will help guide the development of new detection methods based on graphene nanostructured materials.

"The University of Western Ontario's Purple Crow Lidar (PCL) measures temperature and composition of Earth's atmosphere from the surface to 110 km altitude. The PCL is able to make these measurements at unprecedented accuracy by using a 2.65 m diameter liquid mirror telescope. The liquid mirror is a Canadian technology which allows large mirrors to be built at a fraction of the cost of traditional glass mirrors. The long-term objectives of this research program are to search for atmospheric change and to help improve weather forecasting. 



The proposed measurements program will look for atmospheric change in three ways. First, PCL temperatures measurements will be used to study temperature change. Temperature change in the middle atmosphere is not directly affected by land, cities or oceans like surface temperature measurements. Second, ozone and water vapor composition change will be measured at both middle and high latitudes. Third, layers of smoke particles at 14 to 16 km altitude associated with forest fires, injected into the stratosphere via a process called pyroconvection, will be investigated. The smoke particles can travel great distances, and affect both ozone and temperature. With the number and severity of forest fires increasing, forest fires play a more complex role in global warming than anticipated, and we are trying to understand these effects.



The PCL also measures disturbances in the air density similar to waves on the surface of a lake called gravity waves. These waves break like ocean waves on a beach, primarily at altitudes above 50 km. Remarkably, even waves that break 100 km above the surface play an important role in determining the behaviour of weather systems which affect us on the surface. Furthermore, the gravity waves alter composition and thus affect ozone.

The main system under study is a web handling system, more precisely a winder as used in many industries: paper, plastic, metal ... Efficient rejection of disturbances is very important to these industries since they can cause breakage, shutdowns or degradation of the product (e.g. wrinkles), henceforth cause rejects or loss of value of the production. Improving motor drive performance in presence of power supply variations, compensation or attenuation of the effect of friction and of air entrainment in winders and efficient control of apparatus to reject disturbances are means that will be researched in this program to improve efficiency of these machines. The control laws and compensation techniques will be validated on two systems: an autonomous vehicle network to demonstrate some concepts and control structures, and an industrial winder for final proof of concept. 



This work will result in development of new knowledge, and better understanding and control of complex systems. Improved performance and lower sensitivity to external disturbances will benefit industries that use multi-drive systems. To illustrate the potential impact, rejects in some industries are as high as 30% and studies have shown that a system interruption caused by supply disturbances, in particular voltage sags, can cost between 10k$ and 1M$US.

"We are requesting a field portable instrument that measures the reflectance of visible and near-infrared radiation down a soil profile.  This instrument is called a visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) spectrophotometeric probe.  This probe can accurately assess soil carbon contents in a soil and is used by simply inserting the probe into the soil.  Because this instrument measures soil carbon very quickly and at no cost, it will allow us to construct very finely detailed maps of soil carbon in the Arctic, provincial Norths and agricultural ecosystem.  We need to do this because soil carbon varies quite a bit across a field and getting a precise estimate using traditional techniques requires a large number of samples which are costly and time consuming.  In contrast, this probe will allow us to do the work of a few weeks of laboratory analysis in an afternoon.



Soil scientists use soil carbon to help characterize a terrestrial ecosystem.  The probe will provide us with real-time results in the field.  This real-time information will allow us to change our sampling and treatment designs in the field to better reflect field conditions.  The majority of the faculty of the department are on this proposal and we anticipate that this probe will be highly used throughout the field season.","Field-portable visible/near-infrared spectrophotometer for mapping soil carbon in Canada's ecosystems","Agriculture and primary food production",CANADA,CANADA,"Soil science"
"Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, has areas that are heavily contaminated with hydrocarbons and metals.  The purpose of this project is to determine how dangerous these pollutants are to the residents of Iqaluit and to their ecosystem.  Most of these pollutants are trapped just above the permafrost.  Although the soil is frozen, some liquid water is still present in it.  This liquid water may allow soil animals to degrade the pollutants.  Soil organisms involved in a portion of the nitrogen cycle, denitrification, are involved in pollutant degradation.  Denitrification is the conversion of inorganic nitrogen to gaseous nitrogen by organisms that breathe inorganic nitrogen rather than oxygen.  We will attempt to identify the organisms responsible for pollutant degradation in the denitrification cycle, and we will determine whether liquid water helps of hinders organism activity in the permafrost

Liquid water in frozen soil may increase the toxicity of the pollutants by allowing pollutants to poison animals living in the soil that perform critical ecosystem processes such as nitrification.  Nitrification is the conversion of organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen.  It mostly occurs in the winter and is essential for plant growth in the summer.  We are investigating whether liquid water in frozen soil decreases or increases the impact of pollutants on nitrification.   The results from this project will provide Iqaluit residents, and all residents of Arctic communities, with Nunavut residents with crucial information for the management of contaminated urban sites.

"Resource companies often cause large scale disturbances in the northern boreal forest. Restoration of these areas, often in the 1000's of hectares, is technologically challenging because these areas are not readily accessible by land vehicles. The purpose of this project is to develop an eco-restoration technology (ERT) for the Flin Flon/Creighton area that is suitable for application across large spatial extents. In the Flin Flon/Creighton area, the simple application of dolomitic limestone has not been universally successful. We will evaluate why liming is not always successful and develop a soil amendment that will promote revegetation of the Flin Flon/Creighton area. These amendments will first be tested in greenhouses and then beginning in year two of the project, applied in field scale plots. The effect of amendments on the type of metals present in the soil and the ability of these metals to disrupt ecosystem functioning will be assessed using advanced techniques available at the Canadian Light Source. In addition, we will investigate how these amendments are improving soil ecosystem functioning and how we can modify the amendments to account for the effects of climate change on the Flin Flon/Creighton area. Finally, at the end of five years, we will test if the amendments have resulted in a sustainable improvement in ecosystem functioning in the Flin Flon/Creighton area. If successful, this project will provide the first ecorestoration technology that will be suitable for application in Canada's northern boreal forests. This technology is expected to be commercialized by Prairie Plant Systems Inc. and be available to other resource companies operating in Canada's northern boreal forest.","Eco-restoration of large-scale anthropogenic disturbances in the Boreal Shield",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Soil science"

"This research program will concentrate on two recent developments in the field of shape analysis. The first has to do with an outward flow by which the boundary of an object is recovered from a medial manifold. Very recent results in mathematics show that it is possible to recover the differential geometry of a bounding surface from appropriate calculations on its corresponding medial manifold. Furthermore, my group's work on hamilton-jacobi skeletons, and in particular our average-outward flux based formulation,  has been shown to be a special case of a more general medial integral. In fact, it is now possible in theory to obtain integrals of measurable functions on surfaces or volumes directly in terms of their medial integral counterparts. I will focus on translating these theoretical results to a computational setting, grounded in my own expertise in the development of algorithms for obtaining and manipulating medial representations. 

In the second development, my group has been investigating the geometry of 3D streamline flows due to approximately parallel curves as they arise in computer vision, medical imaging and graphics. We have developed a differential geometric characterization of such flows, leading to three curvature measures, and have used minimal surface theory to motivate the choice of a generalized helicoid as an osculating object. Thus far our work has concentrated on the use of these models for Diffusion MRI analysis and for the characterization of white matter fibre tracts. Several computational questions remain to be addressed, and the use of this mathematics for other applications, e.g., texture analysis in vision and hair pattern modeling in graphics, is entirely unexplored. The second major aim of this proposal is to develop the computational aspects of 3D streamline flows. Research progress in these two directions will have important consequences for our understanding of the geometry of object surfaces and of streamline flow patterns, and will impact applications in computer vision, medical image analysis and graphics.

"Canada has many sites where the soil or groundwater is contaminated with heavy metals either through mining and smelting activities or by the natural presence of high levels of heavy metals in the soil.  As well, there are many places where hydrocarbons are inadvertently released into the environment during drilling and production operations in the petroleum industry. 



Changing the chemical form of metals (transformation) can reduce their mobility and toxicity in the environment. Similarly, petroleum hydrocarbons can be degraded into innocuous end products that are less harmful to the environment. Microorganisms are responsible for these transformation and degradation processes as they derive energy for their growth. The proposed research will initially focus on the transformation of arsenic (As) in natural systems and Arsenic-contaminated mine sites in Alberta and British Columbia. Secondly, the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons will be examined under sulfate-reducing conditions which exist in submerged soil and ground water. 



Assessing the interaction of contaminants with different soil properties will determine the contaminant's mobility and transport in the environment, and their bioavailability to microbial populations for ultimate degradation or transformation. Indigenous microbial populations are key players in the transformation of inorganic and organic contaminants in soil. Active microbial communities associated with contaminant's transformation will be identified by cloning and gene sequencing, targeting genes that encode contaminant-degrading enzymes. Understanding and developing theories to predict biotransformation of heavy metals and biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons under various redox conditions will help in the development of strategies for in-situ clean-up of contaminated sites in Canada.","Understanding biogeochemical processes that control transformation of heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons under different redox conditions",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Biology and microbiology"

"Funds are requested to replace the old and dysfunctional wind tunnel with a new low-disturbance wind tunnel. The present facility has several technical issues which affect the flow quality in the wind tunnel, and the results obtained from the wind tunnel tests are unreliable. As a result, this facility cannot be used for research activities, which is adversely affecting the research activities of the applicants. 



The requested equipment is a closed-circuit wind tunnel. One unique feature of the requested wind tunnel is the very low level of background disturbance (within 0.1%)  which is very crucial for providing the high quality flows related to the research activities of the applicants. The requested system will also allow use of state-of-the-art optical techniques; particle image velocimetry (PIV), laser induced fluorescence (LIF) and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) for velocity and species concentration measurements. The requested equipment will be used in diverse applications that cover the research areas of the applicants.



The equipment will support research projects mainly funded by NSERC. It is anticipated that the equipment will be used by at least ten graduate students in the coming four years, and will be fully utilized on other research projects in our research group in the future.","Low disturbance wind tunnel",Engineering,CANADA,CANADA,"Fluid mechanics"
"The rate at which heat transfers across fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces is critically important to many environmental and engineering applications. The proposed research is aimed at investigating the fundamental flow and thermal processes that influence/control the interfacial heat transfer. It will focus on the investigations at both air-water and solid-fluid interfaces. At the air-water interface, the physical interaction between air and water involves a number of complex phenomena, occurring on both air and water sides in the close vicinity of their interface. Due to the complexity of the flow and challenging nature of measurements in the vicinity of the fluctuating interface, the fundamental transport processes across the air-water interface are poorly understood. The heat exchange between a fluid and a solid wall is the fundamental heat transfer process in a wide variety of energy systems. Due to the strong interaction of flow and thermal fields in the near-wall region, the nature of flow in this region is quite complex and not well understood and thus, designing and optimization of heat exchanging devices is heavily relied on empirical relations and bulk characteristics.  

        The objectives of the proposed research are to investigate flow and thermal fields in the interfacial/near-interfacial region, and identify and investigate the physical mechanisms that influence interfacial heat transport process. The research is also aimed at improving the remote sensing techniques for accurate prediction of interfacial heat transfer rate.

        The results from this study will improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms that control interfacial heat transfer and more generally, to a better understanding of the transport processes at the air-water and solid-fluid interfaces. The outcome of this research will allow to improve parameterization of air-sea heat flux, and to develop/improve passive heat enhancement techniques that will lead to an improvement in the thermal performance of heat exchanging devices which will enhance the thermal efficiency of a wide variety of energy systems.

"Canada and the US have recently decided to establish geoid-based vertical datums by 2010 and 2018, respectively. The geoid is the equipotential surface of the idealized oceans at rest and thus serves as the reference surface (datum) for elevations. Therefore, its precise determination and refinement is an on-going subject of research in geodesy, as it is indispensable in mapping, navigation, oceanography, geo-referencing of spatial data and geo-hazards monitoring, and for studying the physics of the Earth's interior, sea level changes, ocean circulation, ice motion, and climate changes. A vertical datum requires precise knowledge of the geoid, the Earth's crust and the mean sea surface, together with their variations in time. Such knowledge can only be obtained by combining space-borne observations with other terrestrial/oceanic information. Of primary importance are the data provided by satellites dedicated (a) to the determination of the Earth's gravity field  (CHAMP, GRACE, and the soon-to-be-launched GOCE) and (b) to the monitoring of the Earth's oceans and ice caps (various laser altimetry satellites, the soon-to-be-launched CryoSat-2, etc.). The abundance of such data presently and in the future provides tremendous opportunities for advancing geodetic research and its applications. Therefore, the main goal, and expected outcome, of the proposed research is to enhance Canada's capacity in remote sensing of the Earth system by developing methods for the joint exploitation of data from various Earth-observing satellites for ocean circulation monitoring and gravity field determination. The first major objective is to determine an accurate high-resolution geoid at continental and global scales, and its temporal and error characteristics. For the second major objective, multi-satellite sea and ice altimetry data from current and future missions will be merged to compute a high-resolution mean sea surface and the contribution of ice sheets to the mean global rise in sea level. Combining both objectives will lead to the successful establishment of a geoid-based vertical datum. Other important outcomes of this research will be the use of GRACE and other data for hydrology studies and for postglacial rebound determination in Canada.","Multi-satellite determination of global and regional geoid and sea level variations","Earth sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Survey engineering and remote sensing"

"IEC61850-based Substation Automation System (SAS) and smart grid are the recent upcoming developments in the area of power system, and the University of Western Ontario is the only university in Canada to initiate the research related to power system protection in these important areas. Existing laboratory facilities at the University of Western Ontario are used for accomplishing valuable research projects in the area of power system protection. Since IEC61850 is a new technology for power system protection and automation, most of the existing laboratory facilities do not have IEC61850 capabilities. Currently, there are three PhD students working in this area under my supervision, and the successful completion of their PhD program will not be possible without the laboratory facilities with IEC61850 capabilities. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to purchase new additional equipment for the power system laboratory at the University of Western Ontario. Minimum laboratory facilities needed to implement and test all important aspects of an IEC61850-based SAS include five embedded computers, five network interface cards with IEEE 1588, two DSP boards equipped with Ethernet ports, three Ethernet switches, and network analyzer. 



These facilities are not only essential for the current PhD students, but also it will be critical to conduct future research in the areas of IEC61850 and smart grid. The proposed system will also contribute to train highly qualified personnel in these areas to meet power industry needs.

"Females have a higher risk of whiplash injury than males.The reason for this higher risk is not clear, but this difference between genders provides an opportunity to increase our understanding of how whiplash injuries develops. The overall objective of the proposed research is to identify anatomical and biomechanical factors that potentially explain the increased risk of whiplash injury in females compared to males. To achieve this objective, female/male comparisons will be made of 1) the size and shape of the muscles of the neck, 2) the alignment and motion patterns of the neck vertebra in different postures and during different voluntary tasks and impact exposures, and 3) the muscle activation patterns generated during different voluntary tasks and impact exposures. In order to isolate gender differences from the more obvious size differences between women and men, the proposed studies will be performed on four groups of subjects: two groups of 50th percentile females and 50th percentile males, and two groups of size-matched females and males. Part 1 of this research will use magnetic resonance (MR) scans of the subjects to examine their neck muscles, Part 2 will use x-ray fluoroscopy to examine the movement patterns of their neck vertebra, and Part 3 will be performed using wires implanted in the neck muscles to measure muscle activity in their superficial and deep neck muscles. Based on our prior work, gender-related differences in muscle size, neck vertebral posture and movement, and muscle activation pattern are expected to be present, even in size-matched female and male subjects. The direct benefit of the proposed research will be a significantly better understanding of the reasons for higher whiplash injury risks in females compared to males. The indirect benefits of the proposed research will be the data needed to develop female crash test dummies and computer models that can be used to design seats and head restraints to protect the segment of the population--females--at greatest risk for whiplash injury.

"The evolution equations of nonrelativistic quantum physics were formulated in the first part of the 20th century in Nobel prize winning works of Schroedinger, Heisenberg, Dirac, von Neumann, Pauli and others. In the last 20 years mathematical theory of these equations has undergone revolutionary development. At the same time, partly forced by miniturization of electronic and communication devices,  new powerful applications of the underlying physical phenomena have arisen. Suddenly, thousands of papers have appeared in Physics and Engineering literature applying these equations in traditionally 'classical' areas of communication, electronics and computing. This development has breathed new life into the well established fields of quantum optics, quantum information theory and theory of semiconductors and has given rise to the new fields of quantum devices and quantum computing.

    In our project we will take our mathematical study of evolution equations of nonrelativistic quantum physics in a new direction dealing with dynamics of coherent quantum macroscopic and nanoscopic structures formed by microscopic many-body systems, as well as we will continue our recent investigations into dynamics of nonrelativistic particle systems interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field. Though the main thrust of this project is purely theoretical, one hopes that better mathematical understanding of quantum dynamics will contribute to the applied fields mentioned above.

"The roles of microbial culture collections are to collect, conserve, and characterize microorganisms and to distribute isolates and information about them to foster research and training. For any type of research involving living microorganisms it is essential that representatives be deposited in collections to ensure scientific reproducibility and rigor. Systematic study depends upon having access to type material as well as to material representing the genetic diversity of a species. The University of Alberta Microfungus Collection and Herbarium (UAMH) is a specialized, general service culture collection of filamentous fungi that is part of a Canadian network involved in the conservation and supply of microorganisms. We provide support to a wide range of research programs nationally and internationally by: 1) conserving fungus isolates of scientific, heritage and industrial value using techniques that assure their long-term care; 2) providing a confidential safe-deposit service for valuable industrial isolates; 3) supplying high quality fungal cultures in an efficient and timely manner; 4) providing advice on organisms appropriate for specific applications through personal consultation and through access to a well developed database containing historical, ecological, geographical, epidemiological, genetic and other data collated over 70 years; 5) enhancing the database by integrating new data (e.g. sequence data, digital images) derived from in-house and external research; 6) collecting and cataloguing fungal diversity on a regional and national basis; 7) providing services to users in the form of identifications, sequence analyses and consultation; 8) educating through academic and professional training, 9) ensuring quality management through compliance with biosecurity, transport and other regulations. Central to this mandate is a research program in fungal systematics that contributes to the development of significant collections, identifies uncharacterized isolates, and attracts users to the UAMH through publications. The UAMH is housed at the Devonian Botanic Garden, a facility unique within the University for its living plant and fungal collections available for scientific research, public education and display.

"The rapidly growing interest in molecular nanoparticles, aerosols, and clusters with diameters ranging from subnanometers to microns arises from their increasing relevance in many different fields. Molecular particles of widely varying composition are seen to play an important role, e. g. as aerosols in atmospheric processes or as reactive sites in interstellar dust. In this context it is obviously crucial to know the chemical composition, the size, and the reactivity of these particles and to understand the processes by which they are formed. The ability to control their formation is not only a prerequisite for laboratory studies, but also opens up other fields of application such as nanoparticles of pharmaceutical agents. The major goal here is the preparation of encapsulated or coated drug particles for controlled or even targeted drug delivery in medical applications.

The key objective of our research is the controlled generation and detailed characterization of such complex molecular systems. This comprises the setup and optimization of many different particle generation methods which allow us to investigate particles of a variety of substances. For the characterization of molecular particles spectroscopic methods are of paramount importance because they are sensitive and can be used under a wide range of different conditions. We exploit this advantage with appropriate spectroscopic tools that work from the infrared to the extreme ultraviolet range and that are specifically tailored to study particulate systems. This instrumentation will enable us to set up corresponding reference databases, which are of immense practical importance, for instance in the process control and for the investigation of atmospheric aerosols. The optimisation of particle generation methods, as another example, will mark an important step forward in the targeted production of drug nanoparticles. By combining our experiments with detailed computer modelling we ultimately aim at unravelling the microscopic origin of the characteristic patterns found in the spectra of these weakly bound particles.

"In the broadest sense my research focuses on understanding the fundamental physical nature, history, and future of the Universe.  It has long been known that, in the hot big bang model, the Universe once was in an extremely hot and dense state where high energy particle physics determined its evolution.  There is an important and intimate connection between the physics of the very small (high-energy particle theory and perhaps string theory) and the physics of the very large (cosmology) and development and pursuit of this connection is the central focus of my research.  By combining clues from laboratory experiments, cosmology and astrophysics we have already learned much about the fundamental physics that governs our Universe and I believe, right now, we are on the brink of discovering much more.  



The standard model of particle physics (SMPP) and general relativity (GR) are the cornerstones of the standard cosmological model (SCM) that has emerged in recent years. Yet, these theories cannot account for the most puzzling and, in my opinion, interesting aspects of the SCM.  Cosmological evidence has forced us to adopt the paradigm that: (I) most of the matter in the Universe is an unknown form known as dark matter; (II) that the rate of expansion of the Universe is currently accelerating due to the presence of dark energy; and (III) some mechanism like inflation occurred in the distant past which solved the classical cosmological problems and seeded the fluctuations we now observe in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation and in the distribution of galaxies.  All three of these revelations point towards new, unexpected, or unconventional particle physics at their origin. We are now in an exciting era where observational cosmology is driving particle physics into new directions away from the SMPP.  The driving goal of my research is to work towards a better physical understanding of the physics of the SCM and in particular the phenomena of dark matter, dark energy, and inflation.

The challenge is to learn the physics of the basic flow in order to invent the most effective and efficient control devices. Studying the response of the flow to control inputs gives further insight into the structure and instability physics, and better understanding of this allows refinement of the control mechanism design. 



In the case of turbulent flows, there are large-scale vortex structures and instabilities that can be used as ""levers"" that will amplify carefully implemented input from actuator mechanisms. We will focus on control of an elevated jet in crossflow, such as occurs in a smoke- or sour gas flare- stack; and control of a backward-facing step flow which is a test platform for separation bubbles that occur everywhere, from aircraft wings to semi-trailers. Sufficient understanding offers benefits such as improving the combustion efficiency in engines and sour gas flare stacks; reducing the energy-consuming and greenhouse gas producing flow resistance forces on automobiles, aircraft and within pipelines; and computational prediction of naturally evolving flows like weather and associated climate change effects. 



In the case of increasingly tiny ink-jetted droplets there are charge and polarity forces which left uncontrolled can cause them to be deposited imprecisely, but which if purposefully added can refine the manufacture of micro devices and electronics. We will explore electrostatic control of picolitre and increasingly smaller droplets in DNA microarray and digital materials printing manufacturing techniques with the intent of  ""steering"" them. Anticipated results are techniques and devices leading to marketable technology that will contribute to a revolution in medicine and micromanufacture.

"The universe is filled with spherical objects: stars and planets are familiar examples.  However, the

universe also contains a wide variety of flattened, disk-like objects. Common examples are ""accretion""

disks in which a central object grows in mass by accreting gas from the disk. The protostellar

disks surrounding newly forming stars are examples, and it is in such disks that new planets form.

The physics of accretion disks is very complex and only partially understood. Better understanding of

the physics of disks in general would lead to better understanding of the formation of stars, planets,

and galaxies -- ie. the ""building blocks"" of our universe.



This Discovery Grant Proposal focuses on a novel type of disk known as a ""decretion"" disk in which gas

is flowing outward from a central star. Many of the same physical processes that operate in accretion

disks operate here. Such decretion disks have been detected surrounding hot, massive stars known as

Be stars. These stars are valuable ""laboratories"" for the detailed study of disks because they are

nearby and relatively bright and a wide range of astronomical observations can be made. For example,

light from the disk can be spread into its component colours to form a spectrum.  Another newly emerging

type of observation combines the light from two or more telescopes to allow direct images of the disks

to be made for the first time.  This Discovery Grant Proposal continues a research program into the

construction of computer models for the decretion disks surrounding Be stars. These complex models can

be used to interpret both types of observations mentioned. Valuable information can then be extracted

about the fundamental physical processes that operate in such disks.

"Newtonian mechanics provides a very accurate description of many everyday phenomena.  Nevertheless, physicists believe that a more fundamental description is available in quantum mechanics. It follows that the quantum-mechanical description of a system in which quantum effects are small should behave like the classical description. In many cases, well-defined mathematical models of the classical and quantum descriptions exist. The physics just mentioned leads to mathematical predictions about these models, predictions which can be proven or disproven rigorously.



I plan to study mathematical objects known as ``eigenfunctions on manifolds''.  These arise both in the theory of numbers and more generally in analysis. A driving force behind my research is that these ``eigenfunctions'' can be interpreted as states of a quantum particle moving in a particular way.  Intuition from physics helps 

predict some of the properties of these quantum states. These properties can then be studied with mathematical tools. Such eigenfunctions lie at the heard of modern analytic number theory; achieving them can help solve important questions in the area  (such as approximations to generalizations of the Riemann Hypothesis). In addition to these special examples, I also plan to study the more ``typical'' cases, seeing to what extent ideas from physics can be placed on firm mathematical footing.



Separately, I study questions of geometry of curved (and more complicated) spaces. It is fairly clear what the average or ``center of mass'' of a collection of points in flat space should be. There are no good notions of ``average'' when the points are distributed on the surface of a sphere, but averaging is possible on other surfaces. Understanding averaging in general allows us to construct unusual algebraic structures, ``random groups'', which are much more rigid than those constructed by other means.

"As climate change concerns grow, environmentally-friendly construction methods and materials are of growing interest to industry. Construction and demolition (C&D) waste comprises 30% of Albertan municipal landfills. Buildings consume 60% of all energy and one-third of all fresh water, while one-fifth of all materials consumed in Canada are used in building construction and operation. With very little change in building technologies occurring over the past 50 years, the time is overdue to develop new, efficient methods for this important industry.



This project is timely, as Canada and the rest of the world have recently become concerned with possible solutions to climate change. The design and construction industries are now embracing the potential environmental and health benefits of green building technologies. New research is needed to meet municipal green building targets (one million Net Zero homes by 2030, 80% reduction in landfill waste 2010 and 50% reduction in water usage) while simultaneously addressing federal policies on Green House Gas emission reductions, improved indoor air quality issues and improved building code restrictions.



Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) Applied Research and Innovation Services established a Green Building Technologies (GBT) applied research initiative in 2008 with three main goals: to lead industry in implementing green-building technologies; to provide training for students in green-building technologies; and to enhance commercialization of green technologies for Canadian industry. GBT applied research program's focuses on four main research areas: 1) Net Zero Envelope & Systems Monitoring; 2) Architectural Ecology; 3) Building Integrated Renewable Energy/ Alternative Energy); and 4) Education and Industry Transformation.

"Forest harvesting and natural disturbance by wildfire and insects converts older forests into younger forests and this can have a large effect on regulation of water production from forests in headwaters regions. As young forests grow, increasing water consumption by growth of canopy leaf area increases the amount of water lost by transpiration during photosynthesis and reduces the amount of water entering the forest by intercepting rain or snowfall. Therefore leaf area regulates how much water the forest vegetation consumes through interception and transpiration, which in turn, regulates how streamflow is produced by forests. Thus changes in forest structure can produce very large changes in water production from headwater regions as forests establish, mature, and develop into old growth phases. Other changes in forest vegetation such as slowly changing species composition with forest succession can also cause large changes in the amount of water the forest vegetation consumes because some species use more water than others. Developing a better understanding how much water is used by forests of differing age and by different forest tree species is important to be able to predict how Canadian water supplies might change with both natural changes in forests over time and those related to human use of the forest.

This research will explore how the water consumption by forests changes as forests mature or reach old growth phases and how changes in forest tree species composition drive similar changes in water production.  A series of studies will compare differences in total water use by younger & old forests by combined water use through transpiration in the overstory/understory vegetation and water lost to interception of precipitation. Another series of studies will explore how changes in forest tree species composition that are typical in forest succession produce overall changes transpiration and interception losses to determine if old growth forests use more or less water than early successional forests. These studies will allow for much better understanding and prediction of forest management, natural disturbances, and climate change may affect Canadian water supplies.

"Improving the ability of programmers to make changes to source code is the long-term goal of my research program. Source code needs to be changed for a number of different reasons. For example, a program already in use (possibly first developed many year earlier) may need to be changed to accommodate new business requirements or a changing execution environment. Even creating new programs can be seen as an iterative process of making changes to the code base, beginning with a very simple version of the program. In addition, both new and existing programs often need to have flaws (i.e., ""bugs"") corrected as they are discovered. Some source code changes may be small with only local effect; other changes may be far reaching involving significant structural modifications. Despite existing work in this area, performing change tasks remains difficult for programmers. 



My proposed research program is foundational in this respect; I intend investigate the issues that make change tasks difficult and then explore opportunities for making improvements. Over the long-term, the aim of this research is to develop a theory that can be used as a basis for improvements to change task practices and to tool support.

"The ultimate goal of this research program is to describe, in detail, the evolution of stellar clusters and their constituent stellar populations from birth to death. Globular and open clusters have historically been very enlightening environments in which to study the evolution of isolated stars, and to study the behaviour of self-gravitating systems. However, it is now clear that these two approaches cannot independently describe both the overall dynamical evolution of the cluster, nor the properties of all the constituent stellar populations.  Close encounters and collisions between individual clusters stars have a significant impact on the appearance and evolution of the cluster. And evidence is emerging that clusters may not be the simple stellar populations we had thought, with primordial binaries and very early star formation playing an important role.  My contributions centre on bringing multiple theoretical tools and techniques together to address the outstanding puzzles in cluster populations and evolution. My group and I are currently concentrating on three specific projects. We are providing theoretical models of dynamically-produced stellar populations in collaboration with observers of a variety of environments, including open clusters, globular clusters, and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We are using hydrodynamical and stellar evolution modelling techniques to study specific stellar collision products. And we are looking at the possibility that an early generation of stars in globular clusters could have been dynamically modified to produce the observed variations in stellar compositions.","The interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics in stellar clusters","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,Stellar

"In supramolecular electronics, complex architectures are built with molecular 'bricks', and these structures are designed to have electronic properties that can be used as active components in electronic applications. For example, they may support electrical current in much the same way as silicon, a well-established semiconductor material. This enables fabrication of displays, solar cells, and other electronic devices with materials that are essentially plastics. These materials have caused considerable excitement in the scientific community. Useful applications of these so-called organic semiconductors depend upon the controlled interactions between molecules, and benefit from well-defined intermolecular structure. For example, the efficiency of charge transport is enhanced when molecules adopt ordered conformations with molecular interactions in a direction parallel to the transport direction. Our objectives are to measure, in real time, processes that are important in electronic applications of these nanostructures. We will do so by starting electronic events with short laser pulses (shorter than a millionth of a millionth of a second) and following the time evolution of those processes by mapping light emission or absorption of another laser pulse after the initiating laser burst. Understanding electronic processes in these new and exciting materials is essential for further development of organic electronics beyond incremental optimisation of materials and device parameters. However, the understanding obtained from this programme will have profound implications for other areas of science. For example, we will develop comparisons with light harvesting in photosynthesis and energy transport in DNA. Furthermore, this research is timely because of recent development of model materials to correlate unambiguously structure with electronic dynamics. This work takes advantage of the synergistic efforts of chemists and physicists to design new materials for electronic applications.","Unravelling electronic dynamics in supramolecular semiconductors from femtoseconds to milliseconds","Energy storage and conversion",CANADA,CANADA,"Electronic properties of solids"

"Macroecological patterns of abundance, occurrence, species richness and body size distribution have been described for various taxa including mammals and birds. However, the mechanisms behind most of these patterns have not been tested yet, possibly because they are rooted in different theoretical frameworks. In addition, these mechanisms have often been considered in isolation even though they must be necessary linked, as the same individual organisms contribute to all of them. Landscape and local patterns may differ from these macroecological patterns. Interactions between local and landscape processes are also poorly understood, but potentially complex because many processes co-vary with the level of fragmentation. Recently, it has been suggested that movement and dispersal patterns may also be important determinants of these patterns. The main goal of the proposed research program is to investigate the patterns of abundance, occurrence, species richness, movement, and body size distribution across spatial scales. Specifically, our objectives are: (1) to investigate these patterns at the regional, landscape, and local spatial scales by focusing on the ""anatomy"" (e.g. shape, gaps, skewness) of their distribution as well as the linkages among the variables; (2) to examine the role played by the body size distribution in determining other ecological patterns; and (3) to investigate animal movement and dispersal patterns and their interactions with other ecological patterns. To achieve these objectives, we will obtain data from field studies (live-trapping, radio telemetry, GPS telemetry), computer simulations, and macroecological databases. Analyses will involve the use of the Geographic Information System (GIS), spatial statistics, mathematical-physics concepts, and various univaritate and multivariate statistical tests. This project will improve our understanding of ecological patterns and the mechanisms that create them. It will also help to gain a better theoretical understanding of the effects of the spatial scale on ecological patterns and processes.

"Machine learning research has focused on inducing a model of a function or classification task strictly from a set of training examples.  Consequently, machine learning systems do not take advantage of previously acquired task knowledge when learning a new and potentially related task.  This is unfortunate since prior task knowledge offers the potential to produce more accurate models in less time and using fewer training examples.  My research investigates machine life-long learning (ML3) systems (particularly, architectures of artificial neural networks) that are capable of retaining and selectively transferring task knowledge when learning a new task. Data mining and adaptive software systems can benefit from the use of inductive transfer and ML3 methods.  For example, more accurate medical diagnostic models can be developed from small samples of patients by using previously learned and related diagnostic models.  Adaptive systems can learn more efficiently the interaction model (profile) of a new user by selectively transferring knowledge from similar user models.

    This research program will explore several questions raised by my most recent research into the use of multiple task learning (MTL) methods: What characteristics must a machine learning method have to affect inductive transfer using contest sensitive MTL (csMTL) encoded examples?  Under what conditions will the csMTL approach fail? What is the best use of available training examples?  Does the csMTL method mitigate the need for a measure of task relatedness?  Can the approach be used for domains with real-valued outputs and multiple outputs per task?  Can csMTL be used to accurately consolidate task knowledge? 

    The return on investment in this research will be advancements in machine learning theory, the creation of a valuable machine learning research system that will be shared with the community, the training of several high quality researchers and the application of next generation machine learning to data mining and adaptive software systems.

"In cryptography, a side channel attack is any attack based on information gained from the physical

implementation of a cryptosystem. For example, by monitoring the computing time, power consumption, and

electromagnetic radiation, valuable information can be obtained, which can later be used to break the code.

Silicon chips have always been vulnerable to this class of attacks since it is in general possible to capture and

measure the physical manifestations of silicon and processing and map them against chip processing, and

output or known plaintext in order to break the chip security (key). Whitenoise Laboratories took special

measures against such attacks. First, there is no key transfer; second, after key load every operation is Order 1.

There are no discernible differences in processing activity for data about physical manifestations to be mapped

against. However, a thorough testing is still required to confirm the Whitenoise Lab's approach. This project

will analyze the robustness of an FPGA implementation of Whitenoise Laboratories cryptographic algorithms.

One major goal is to eliminate the key standards concerns of interoperability and implementation of the

proposed cryptosystem. It will also facilitate the transitional path to creating a full-production cost effective

unit (e.g., a full-custom integrated circuit) with a major Canadian partner. This project will constitute a major

step forward in solving a historic problem that has plagued the computer security area since the advent of

silicon processing.","Testing cryptographic algorithms against side channel attacks","Information, computer and communication technologies",CANADA,CANADA,"Information technology"

"Small non-coding RNA molecules are playing important roles in cells. They constitute the central player of two new biological processes called the microRNA and RNA interference pathways that are important for controlling genes expression in animals and plants. Although that both pathways use small RNAs, their mode of action in animals are very distinctive. Our research project will focus on the understanding of the difference and the similitude between the RNA interference and the microRNA pathways.



To achieve this task, we will utilize the round worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to: 1) follow the behavior of RNA molecules implicated in the microRNA and RNA interference pathways in the living animal; 2) study cellular components associated in these processes and; 3) study how proteins associated to the microRNA and RNA interference work in living animals.

"Tree species ranges are predicted to shift dramatically in Canada with climate change, typically with northward migration at the leading edges and extensive mortality at the trailing edges. The ability of trees to migrate will depend not only on their genetic suitability, but also the hospitability of the new environment, including the presence of compatible ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) in soil, the severity of site disturbance, and the intensity of plant competition. Whereas previous research predicting tree species range shifts has focused on climatic and genetic factors, my program makes the novel contribution of examining the contributing biotic effects of EMF and mycorrhizal networks (MNs) in real species migration experiments using cutting edge techniques in isotope tracers, molecular biology (metagenomics, microsatellites, and DNA sequencing) and network analysis. Across a regional drought-stress gradient serving as a spatial proxy for climate change, I will study the roles of: (1) local EMF in facilitating migration of tree genotypes to new environments; (2) MNs formed by mature trees in facilitating natural regeneration, particularly of closely related (kin) genotypes; (3) disturbance severity in reorganizing the MN and affecting natural regeneration patterns; and (4) shifting interplant carbon source-sink gradients in transfer of carbon from dying to establishing trees.  For (1), I will examine the role of EMF in establishment of non-local tree genotypes within assisted migration field and growth chamber experiments. For (2) and (3), I will plant kin and non-kin seed in mesh bag treatments (controlling for the formation and complexity ot MNs) either in natural gaps or within harvesting treatments that remove different levels of hub (highly connected) trees. For (4), I will manipulate seedling carbon source-sink gradients using defoliation treatments emulating natural tree senescence. The contributions of my program on the roles and mechanisms by which EMF and MNs facilitate tree range shifts, and how these affect plant community and soil carbon dynamics, will help scientists to predict forest ecosystem responses to climate change and managers to design practices for maintaining the resilience, carbon storage, and adaptive capacity of Canada's forests.

"In this research program, I will be developing new nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic techniques for studying the structure and dynamics of the major molecular components of biological membranes. Structural information will tell us how, on average, molecular segments are placed relative to each other. Dynamic information will tell us how these molecular segments fluctuate about their average positions, how fast they do it, and with what amplitude. 

   Why is a knowledge of structure and dynamics so important? Recent research advances have led biophysicists to the conclusion that for biological molecules, including those of membranes, structure and dynamics are two sides  of the same coin: both play important roles in biological function. The basic structural features of membranes are now well characterized, but this static or time-averaged picture often found in textbook descriptions cannot possibly do justice to the dynamic character of cell membranes. Providing this dynamic description will fill a significant gap in our knowledge, and help us better understand the structure of membrane molecules, and its relationship to biological function.

   Why have I chosen NMR spectroscopy to carry out my studies? First, NMR spectroscopy will allow us to monitor events at the molecular level without disturbing the system. Selective isotopic labeling of molecules allows us to focus on precisely the molecular segments of interest. Second, through its ability to monitor the local molecular environment, including both the molecular geometry and the degree of segmental disorder, NMR complements other physical techniques such as X-ray or electron diffraction that are dependent upon long-range order or periodicity. This ability to probe the molecular environment is particularly effective in studies of ""soft"" matter, and uniquely situates NMR spectroscopy as a technique that can provide atomic resolution structural information for biological molecules in dynamic membranes.

"Thickening mine tailings prior to surface disposal is an attractive alternative to conventional disposal in dams, as it eliminates the catastrophic risks of dam failure, reduces the total volume of tailings, and reduces the potential for seepage of contaminants. When deposited on the ground, thickened tailings flow like toothpaste, forming gently sloping stacks. However, at present, engineers are unable to anticipate how the tailings flow and how the geometry of the stack will develop, making thickened tailings management difficult. This study investigates the large-scale flow of thickened tailings and will develop a computer code cable of simulating the evolution in stack geometry. This computer code can then be used by engineers to design closure schemes before the tailings are even deposited, which will facilitate rapid isolation of the tailings from the environment.

"The deposition of thickened tailings is an attractive alternative for mine waste management. Conventionally, tailings are deposited as a slurry, which requires the construction of very large dams. Unfortunately, these dams have often failed, resulting in economic and ecological devastation of the areas downstream. Thickened tailings eliminates this risk of catastrophic failure, by dewatering the tailings to the point that they exhibit some strength immediately after deposition, allowing them to be stacked at a gentle slope. The strength of the tailings may increase over time due to further densification from settling and desiccation. Sufficient desiccation has to happen in order for enough strength to develop to maintain stability of the stack. 

 

This proposal aims to develop a methodology for determining the required drying time for a deposited layer of thickened tailings, that can be immediately transfered to industry upon completion of the project.

"Polymer nanocomposites are materials for which at least one dimension of the structure is less than 100 nm. They provide a new way to overcome the limitations of traditional microscale composites. The categories of nanocomposites that our research group has worked on include clays (montmorillonite) and nanopowders (nano-alumina, nano-titania and nano-silica). The challenge is in the discovery of new methods, which are commercially viable, to achieve the proper dispersion of those nanoparticles at the nanoscale level and to stabilize that dispersion at the nanoscale level after processing with a polymers. Because the nanoparticles are so small, the surface-to-volume ratio is considerable high as when compared to microparticles. This significantly increases the importance of controlling the interfacial interaction between nanoparticles and polymers; otherwise the final properties of the nanocomposites will not be better. Polymer nanocomposites have novel and attractive properties that are relevant to the automotive, building, packaging and energy sectors. For example, our previous research has developed coatings prepared with polymer nanocomposites that have improved scratch resistance and hardness, can be transparent and self-cleaning, and be more durable. We have previously investigated and developed effective methods for stabilizing nanoparticles within a polymer matrix using in-situ polymerization where the polymer chains are bonded to the nanoparticles. This research grant will investigate methodologies for manufacturing novel polymer nanocomposites. Contributions will be made on how to control the structure of the final nanocomposites by combining different types of polymers bonded to the surface of the nanoparticles using in situ polymerization. Polymer chains of distinct nature bonded to the surface of nanoparticles will allow self assembling and better control of the nanostructures. Training HQP in this research area will contribute to the industrial needs for expertise in processing and chemical modification of nanoparticles, manufacturing polymer nanocomposites and understanding the structure and properties of such novel materials.","Advanced polymer materials","Consumer goods",CANADA,CANADA,"Materials science and technology"

"Austenitic manganese steels with a high manganese (Mn) content represent a branch of steels that offer a high degree of ductility with high-strength. While typically quite soft, these steels have a large capacity to work harden when they are plastically deformed and dramatically increase their strength characteristics. Their work hardening capacity and dramatic increase in strength are linked to their dynamic behaviour during plastic deformation. As the material plastically deforms it transforms into much harder and stronger martensite. As a result, this martensitic phase transformation and other associated damage mechanisms make these steels very difficult to process. At the same time however, it is these very same properties that make them ideal for a number of applications in areas such as automotive, tool and die, oil refinement, and other natural resources such as mining and forestry.

The proposed research examines the behaviour of austenitic Fe-Mn steels with a high manganese content during metal cutting across different scales (from microscale up to macroscale cutting). The motivation for this research stems from the need to understand the dynamic behaviour of these steels under the extreme conditions encountered during metal cutting so that they can be more readily processed and utilized by Canadian industry. To date there is little information available on these materials outside of examining the behaviour of these austenitic high-manganese steels in tensile testing at low temperatures, and no work has been done in the area of machining and metal cutting. Therefore, the proposed research in machining these manganese steels will use a novel technique for examining the cutting process as it occurs, and use cutting tests, finite element modeling, microscopy, and heat treating to better understand the behaviour of these steels during machining, to create new research opportunities in the area of machining and finite element modeling, and create new applications and opportunities for the use of these materials for Canadian industry.

Climate models help (a) to improve our understanding of the physical processes that drive the climate system, to identify the relationships and feedbacks that operate within and between climate system components, and to predict future changes in regional and global climate, (b) to clarify the connections between human actions and the Earth-system, and (c) help policy-makers to enact effective policies and programs to address and to adapt to climate change. Global climate models offer the best approach to understanding the physical climate system by capturing, at various resolutions, the basic behaviour of the physical processes that drive the climate. However, these models focus only on natural systems, and do not represent socio-economic systems that affect and are affected by natural systems. The most common approach to combining socio-economic and biophysical systems involves applying projected trends (scenarios) to 'drive' the climate model. The question to be addressed in this research is: ""How do the expected paths of climate, environmental, and economic variables change when feedbacks between the economy and the environment are more fully modeled than in previous work?"" The proposed research will provide improved representations of the physical processes involved in the climate system and carbon cycle, and will include the socio-economic sectors and activities that govern interactions with the biophysical system, especially those that influence or control anthropogenic emissions. This research will help to identify the importance of nonlinearities and feedbacks in determining the behaviour of the social-economic-climatic system. It will also provide the Canadian government with a scientifically credible tool useful for policy: a system dynamics-based climate-economy model, connecting science, governance, economics, and the environment.","An integrated system dynamics model for analyzing behaviour of the social-economic-climatic system","Climate and atmosphere",CANADA,CANADA,"Other studies in natural sciences and engineering"

More than 30% of the energy used in Canada is directed to control the indoor comfort conditions and to provide an adequate supply of conditioned ventilation air for buildings.  For various types of commercial buildings, 20 to 50% of the energy used may be used to condition outdoor ventilation supply air to maintain comfort conditions while the same amount of indoor air is exhausted.  Using commercially available energy wheels, heat and moisture exchange between the supply ventilation air and the exhaust air can reclaim 80% of the waste energy in the exhaust air; however, it may be not cost effective for retrofitting existing buildings because the supply and exhaust air ducts are not side-by-side.  The purpose of this project is to develop and test a new run-around, membrane energy exchanger (RAMEE) system for buildings that will transfer heat and moisture between remote supply and exhaust ducts.  This novel RAMEE system is expected to be cost effective in both new and retrofit applications.

".     Research on buildings is very important because Canadians spend over 90% of their time in buildings and the building sector in Canada accounts for over 30% of energy consumption. Therefore, buildings that provide occupants with a good indoor climate and air quality (i.e., healthy buildings), while consuming minimal energy are important for a healthy, prosperous and sustainable nation. An important, but often neglected, indoor environmental parameter is humidity, thus indoor humidity is often considered to be of small importance for a successful design because temperature is easier to sense, quantify and control. Nevertheless, research has shown that the indoor relative humidity can significantly affect: (i) thermal comfort, (ii) the perception of air quality, (iii) occupant health, (iv) the durability of building materials, (v) material emissions and (vi) energy consumption. In fact, moisture is one of the leading causes of building failure and poor indoor air quality in Canada and countries with similar cold climates. Since temperature and humidity play an important role in the human perception of air quality, air that is hot and humid will be perceived to have a poor quality (or high concentration of contaminants) regardless of whether it is polluted or not. The quality of the indoor environment is especially important because it is strongly linked to the health and well being of occupants.

      This research program will investigate heat and moisture transfer processes within buildings, with special attention to moisture transfer between indoor air and hygroscopic building structures and within high efficiency air-to-air moisture exchangers for conditioning outdoor ventilation air and interior spaces of buildings. This research will result in the application of optimal hygroscopic materials and moisture exchangers, which is expected to improve the comfort, health and productivity of occupants, reduce the energy demand and consumption of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems, and improve the indoor air quality and sustainability of buildings. The research is also important for the efficient and wide-spread implementation of Alternative Energy Systems in buildings.

"Free-living protozoa represent a large fraction of species and higher groups of eukaryotic organisms (i.e. everything more complex than bacteria), however, our understanding of their biodiversity lags way behind that of other eukaryotes, e.g. animals, plants, fungi, algae, and parasites.  This project seeks to understand the biodiversity of protozoa in extraordinary habitats that are often considered to have very few eukaryotic organisms in them at all:  anoxic habitats (were there is little or no oxygen), and hypersaline habitats (where the concentration of salt is 3-10 times that in normal seawater).  We will culture small free-living protozoa from these habitats, and use comparisons of gene sequences to determine their evolutionary relationships to each other, and to previously isolated protozoa from these habitats and from other environments.  We  aim to understand whether protozoa have become adapted to these environments on few occasions or many occasions in evolutionary history.  Some of the organisms will represent new higher taxa (maybe the equivalent of new 'phyla'), and will be described in detail using electron microscopy, and further DNA sequence characterisation and analysis.   In the case of anoxic protozoa we will also obtain DNA sequences for particular groups directly from the environment, and compare them to the sequences from cultured species:  This will allow us to determine whether the species we have in culture are a good representation, or a poor representation, of the actual diversity of these organisms present in nature.  In the case of protozoa from hypersaline habitats we see a strange phenonemon where some of the protozoa that live in extremely saline water look exactly the same as protozoa that are found in marine samples.   We will compare gene sequences from multiple isolates of thse 'identical' marine and hypersaline protozoa to determine how genetically similar they actually are, and whether they segregate into distinct evolutionary groups based on the salinity they grow best at.  This will contribute to understanding what a species really is (if anything) the world of complex, possibly asexual microbes.

"The proposal aims to develop a new field of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to directly assess how and why contaminants become sequestered in soils, and thus are hard to remediate in the environment. The new technology termed ""Comprehensive Multiphase"" NMR (CMP-NMR) will be novel and globally unique. The approach will be developed specifically to study molecular interactions in unaltered multiphase samples (i.e. samples containing solid, liquid, semi-solid/gel components) such as soil and sediments. The approach will not only identify the components in soils to which contaminants bind (i.e. lignin, protein, cuticle etc.) and the specific molecular bonds/interactions/domains (in the soil and on the contaminant) responsible for these associations but when combined with modern in-situ toxicity methods, provides a framework, to assess the complex relationship between soil-sorption and bioavailability. CMP-NMR will provide a detailed insight at the molecular-level of the processes that cause contaminants to be entrapped in the soil matrix and describes the complete binding environment of the contaminant in unaltered (not even dried) natural samples. As such it represents a powerful tool to assess the efficiency and effectively of existing and novel remediation approaches The project will provide a new understanding of current problems as well as providing a new suite of molecular tools that can evaluate new remediation strategies such as the use of new surfactants or new microbial strains for bioremediation. The molecular information will not only identify if the remediation is effective but describes which contaminant-soil bonds/associations remain intact, thus explaining why a specific strategy is not effective. With knowledge as to the exact soil components (for example protein) and facets of the contaminant that cause binding it should be relatively easy using physical-chemical predictions to select the most effective agents for their release.","The development of comprehensive multiphase NMR spectroscopy to understand environmental contamination at the molecular level",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Environmental geochemistry"

"Livestock and fish processing in Canada generate large quantities of waste biomass, much of which is unfit for

human consumption, and is discarded into the environment. Furthermore, the global outbreak of bovine

spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has caused Canada, and other countries, to ban the use of some animal

byproducts in animal feeds, and to stop the flow of cattle specified risk material (SRM) into the human food

chain. These developments in the Canadian agri-food sector now require transformation of ever-increasing

amounts of waste biomass, if the environment is to be protected. A not fully explored outlet for slaughterhouse

and fishery waste is the production of biodiesel (BD). Current interest in BD production and usage derives

from declining reserves and high price of fossil fuels, and the societal need to reduce green house gas (GHG)

emission. Biodiesel is conventionally produced by chemical transesterification of oils and fats but this process

results in low yields of BD, and the co-production of caustic waste which requires costly methods for safe

disposal. Enzymatic transesterification of fats and oils is a safe and efficient means of BD production, and this

process would overcome the drawbacks of chemical transesterification. The proposed project aims to develop,

and optimize, the process of enzymatic transesterification of fats and oils from animal discards in order to

produce BD in high yields. Glycerol, a co-product of the transesterification process, will be converted to

methanol, which would then be recycled as a reactant to sustain the production of BD. The benefits of the

project include: 1) development of new knowledge and technologies for the emerging Canadian biorefinery

industry; 2) employment opportunities to strengthen Canada's industrial base in the global biobased economy;

3) alleviation of the environmental problems associated with the disposal of slaughter house and fishery waste

from the Canadian agri-food industries; 4) reduction in Canada's reliance on fossil fuel and improvements in

the country's energy security; and 5) training of highly qualified personnel in the high technology fields of

bio-engineering, and biomass transformation and re-utilization.

"The fish industry is an important component of Canada's agri-food sector, and generates millions of dollars in revenue each year. However, fish stocks have been declining in recent years. This fact coupled with the seasonal nature of the seafood harvest and the high perishability of the raw material make it necessary to develop more effective procedures to reduce spoilage to ensure availability of the products for human consumption. The two main factors responsible for the rapid loss of fish quality are microbial activity and autolysis by endogenous enzymes. Thus far, fish spoilage by microorganisms has been well studied, while the contribution of autolysis to the spoilage phenomenon is less well studied. The proposed study will investigate novel approaches based on high pressure in combination with other barriers such as natural antioxidants and low temperature storage, as tools for preserving  premium seafood quality.  Seafood processing also generates high volumes of discards that are currently not put to high value uses. However, the discards are rich is useful biochemicals such as enzymes that may be recovered in pure forms for several commercial applications. The global market for enzymes is estimated at 1.3 billon dollars (US) per year, with a growth rate of 12-15% per year. There is a growing need to discover new sources of enzymes to meet the market demands, and fish processing discards represent an underutilized resource material with potential to fill this need. In the proposed studies, two groups of fish enzymes (fish lipases and  transglutaminases) will be recovered and investigated in transesterification reactions to incorporate useful biomolecules (e.g., omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) in human foods for health benefits; and for transforming oils from fish processing discards  into biodiesel as alternative fuel to reduce the dependence on fossil fuel. Fish transglutaminases will also be prepared and used to modify biomolecules to make them more resistant to degradation, and thereby facilitate the development of novel biomaterials for food and non-food uses. Such use of transglutaminases will be more acceptable to consumers compared with the use of chemicals to achieve simalar modifications in food products.

"Ocular Surface Sensory Processing

The surface of the eye is one of the most sensitive places on the body and yet little is understood about this sensitivity in humans. This proposal is for the continuation of a series of experiments to examine this in humans, with a unique device that blows tiny amounts of a mixture of air and carbon dioxide onto the eye. This device enables us to measure the response in humans to pressure (a scratchy feeling), chemical (burning or stinging) and cold stimulation of the surface of the eye.

The proposal is to perform a series of experiments to characterise the sensitivity of the whole exposed and hidden (under the lids) surface of the eye to determine what can just be detected, as well as what can be felt to be different (detection and discrimination thresholds). In addition, the response of the ocular surface with stimuli that are more noticeable (suprathreshold) will also be examined. 

These maps of how the surface responds to these different kinds of stimuli will be compared to new measures of the anatomy of the eye's surface (obtained particularly using a confocal microscope) as well as to what was known beforehand about the physiology of the eye.

Finally, we will begin to examine what happens to the other structures of the eye (e.g., the blood vessels) when a painful stimulus is applied, in order to develop an understanding of the circuits on the eye's surface that respond to painful and innocuous stimuli.

The long term goal of this research is to understand how we sense things at the surface of our eyes, develop better measurements of this sensing so that, eventually, we will be able to develop better treatments for uncomfortable and painful eyes.","Ocular surface sensory processing",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Sensory systems and perception"

"An ultrasonic pulser/receiver is a piece of electrical equipment used in the nondestructive evaluation of engineering components; the primary objective is to characterize flaws and material properties. A high frequency ultrasonic pulse is sent into the engineering structure, and the returned echo signals are examined to derive the maximum amount of information possible about the location, size, and type of any detected flaws. This data can then be used in numerical models to estimate the hazard level posed by the abnormalities, and to monitor any change that has occurred since the previous inspection.  Our work is a combination of wave modeling, instrument development, and digital signal processing/image enhancement. The ultimate goal is to make ultrasonic testing more accurate, more reliable, and targeted to reveal the type of information required by the end users.

This particular piece of equipment operates at over 10 times the frequency range normally used for industrial or medical ultrasonic tests; the high frequency enables the system to achieve very fine resolution for tasks such as evaluation of microscopic features of thin samples of biological tissue, inspection of the critical interfacial layer in an adhesive bond, or accurate determination of the size, shape, and hazard potential posed by a near-surface flaw. Although this is a laboratory instrument, it will be used to develop new inspection techniques that should see widespread application.  Such applications can help protect the environment (inspection of oil/gas pipeline), increase safety for people (aircraft), provide increased reliability of essential services(electricity generation), and save money (inspection of components destined for subterranean or deep ocean use).

"An ultrasonic scanner is a robotic device used to acquire images of the interior of an engineering component or tissue sample, by moving an ultrasonic sensor in a controlled pattern over the specimen.  To be an effective research tool, the scanner must be able to trace out a variety of inspection patterns in 3 dimensions, and have very good accuracy and repeatability. Such an automated scanner is a fundamental piece of equipment required for almost all projects in a laboratory conducting research in the field of nondestructive evaluation. In addition to the robotic system, the scanner includes encoders for tracking the robot's position, motor controllers, software, and an inspection tank where the specimen is located.

Current projects for which the scanner will be used include: (a) development of advanced signal processing methods to enable accurate sizing of welds, (b) manufacture and evaluation of high-frequency ultrasonic ""phantoms"" for biomedical research, (c) detection of defects in pre-stressed concrete cylindrical pipe (PCCP), used to deliver fresh water to homes and businesses, and (d) evaluation of the environmental degradation of adhesive bonds. For each of these projects, the scanner will be integrated with either high-frequency or low-frequency probes and signal processing equipment to characterize the features of interest.

"The primary purpose is to conduct a long term research program on biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics in the Serengeti ecosystem, East Africa.  We use Protected Areas as Ecological Baselines to compare with human-dominated ecosystems outside.  The Serengeti provides a unique opportunity to understand (1) how a natural ecosystem works, (2) what role biodiversity plays in this system, and (3) what human influences are threatening this biodiversity.  

The Main Questions are: 1.  What are the rules for the sustainability and resilience of ecosystems? 2. How do disturbances cause changes in state or destabilize ecosystems?  3. What are the consequences when components of biodiversity are lost from a system?  The three aspects are:

1. The role of disturbance in ecosystem stability and biodiversity. We are documenting the impacts of two natural disturbances, fire and grazing, on the biodiversity and abundance of birds and insects in the Serengeti grassland ecosystem. 

2. Multispecies movement models. We are measuring how predators are limited in their ability to catch prey by having to live in prides and having to deal with prey in herds. Both aspects prevent lions from depleting their food source and this provides stability. We are examining how general this rule for stability is with other predators.

3. The biodiversity knockout experiment (BioKO). This program is designed to understand the role that functional groups of our biota play in whole versus communities that have lost species. The essence of the experiment is to knock out different plant functional groups, then compare the stability of this reduced system with systems that have their full biota.

Understanding the rules for ecosystem stability, and what causes them to collapse, are essential for maintaining both our own human systems and those of conservation areas.","Regulation of ecosystems and biodiversity loss","Conservation and preservation",CANADA,CANADA,"Terrestrial ecology"
"Ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation is a well-established technique for characterizing defects in engineering components and structures. A high frequency pulse is sent into the engineering structure, and the returned echo signals are examined to derive the maximum amount of information possible about the location, size, and type of any detected flaws. This data can then be used in numerical models to estimate the hazard level posed by the abnormalities, and to monitor any change that has occurred since the previous inspection. Safety is improved and engineering structures can be designed more efficiently.

In this research program, we are seeking to improve the sharpness of the ultrasonic image that we obtain of both imbedded flaws and the interface that links any two engineering components together. This will be accomplished by combining technologies originally developed in three disparate fields: (a) digital signal enhancement techniques originally developed in the fields of seismology and geophysics; (b) phased array technology and micro-transducer fabrication that are now commonly used in the biomedical field, and (c) advanced vibration spectroscopy analysis combined with numerical modeling. Specific applications of this work include the measurement of weld defects in oil & gas pipeline welds; environmental degradation of the interfacial strength in adhesive bonds; the role of intermetallic compounds in explosive welds; detection of low pull-out strength in fiber-reinforced composites. The work is a combination of wave modelling, instrument development, and digital signal processing/image enhancement. The ultimate goal is to make ultrasonic testing more accurate, more reliable, and targeted to reveal the type of information required by industrial users.

In a spin-off project to the phased array work, we are working with biomedical researchers to develop a tiny ultrasonic pump, of the order of a few millimetres in size. The micropump will be invaluable in the microfluidics field, and will be used by our biomedical partners in the design of lab-on-a-chip devices for analysis of biological fluids.

"Low temperatures, especially in winter, are an important influence on the population biology and distribution of insects.  The focus of this research is to understand how insects survive (and thrive!) at low temperatures.  



We will study the ways in which overwintering conditions affect insects at sites in British Columbia and southwestern Ontario, with a long term goal of predicting how insects will respond to changing winter conditions with climate change.  In particular, the research will focus on how the fluctuations in temperature seen in the real world, for example the repeated freeze-thaw cycles common in SW Ontario, affect insect survival and reproduction.  We will not only look at survival mechanisms and strategies, but also measure metabolism and energy reserves both in the lab and the field, and link our work to observed climate and to collaborators investigating population cycles and northern range limits in insects.  



A second part of the program will investigate the biochemical and molecular mechanisms that determine when and why insects are paralyzed at low temperatures (a state called chill coma).  Our research will use a combination of laboratory model insects (including Drosophila fruit flies and Tribolium flour beetles), wild insects (including swallowtail butterflies) and abundant insect pests like the Colorado potato beetle.

"Packaging steels are used in a myriad of everyday products from food and beverage containers to closures and utensils. This application of steel increasingly requires a combination of high formability with high strength. Formability is demanded for increasingly complex shapes while improved strength allows for reduced sheet thickness resulting in weight savings. Coupled to these design constraints are cost, recyclability and surface characteristics. Such combinations of properties are difficult to achieve and thus limits are traditionally placed on the strength and thickness of packaging steels. We seek in this proposal to overcome the limitations imposed by traditional strengthening mechanisms in ultra-low carbon packaging steels through the use of a novel processing route involving the vapour deposition of a thin layer of iron highly supersaturated in carbon to the surface of thin steel sheet. This will be followed by controlled annealing to generate a compositionally graded hybrid composite. This route will allow for substantial increases in strength of the product without the significant decrease in ductility associated with conventional strengthening methods used for packaging steels. Moreover, this processing route is compatible with the flow of packaging steels (including subsequent coating technologies) and as it only involves the addition of carbon to the sheet, it does not degrade the material's recyclability. This project falls under the NSERC strategic Grants priority area of Competitive Manufacturing in the sub-topic of hybrid composite materials. Moreover, this project is being submitted under the NSERC-ANR Concurrent Call for Joint Research Proposals. A strongly collaborative research project has been built combining the expertise of the Canadian team in materials fabrication and mechanical testing with the French

team's expertise in materials characterization and modelling. Moreover, the industrial supporter of this project, having facilities in both Canada and France, will play a strong role by participating in the experimental work and allowing graduate students to perform research at their facilities.","ANR_Graded hybrid composite steel sheet for packaging applications","Manufacturing processes and products",CANADA,CANADA,"Materials structure, properties and testing"
"Materials processing technologies have advanced to the point where control now begins at the atomic scale.  With this degree of control comes the ability to highly tune material properties to meet the demands of individual applications.  One method to achieve such control over structure and properties is physical vapour deposition (PVD).  Via PVD technologies it is possible to achieve microstructures and materials impossible via other techniques.  For example, it is possible to achieve materials with very high densities of internal interfaces exhibiting combinations of strength and ductility unachievable by other routes.

Development of PVD technology has brought it to the point where it is becoming increasingly attractive for application in continuous coating of metallurgical products, e.g. metallic sheet.  For example in Europe there are now industrial PVD coating lines capable of handling full sized steel sheet.  This proposal focuses on the deposition of alloys on to metallic substrates, such that the microstructural scale of the deposit is on the order of a few nanometers.  This builds on recent observations of alloy coatings with combined strength and ductility via the incorporation of high densities of growth faults and/or twins.  The broad goal is to advance our knowledge on the fundamental relationship between plasticity and microstructural scale, while examining the potential for the use of such coatings in metallurgical applications.

From a practical point of view, this work will involve the deposition of commercially relevant metallic alloys, leading to the production of hard surfaces with chemistries the same as, or very similar to, the chemistry of the underlying sheet.  Such technology could have numerous applications within the Canadian metals industry, important given that Canada lags behind Europe and Asia in developing this technology for application to sheet metal.  In this context the proposal should be considered within the framework of the Reallocation Committee's  Proposal 1 "" Application of New Technologies in Canadian Resource Industries"".

"Language comprehension is central to most realms of human activity, from conversation to enjoying a novel to deciphering a technical manual. This research combines human experimentation and computer simulation to inspect the mental processes that permit adults to understand messages in their first language and to represent message meaning.



Comprehension is largely inferential -- having read that the glass fell to the concrete, people generally understand that the glass BROKE. One focus of the research is how people infer the complex goal structures that underlie text. A newspaper article might describe two states disputing their rights to an ocean island, or fictional characters jointly trying to achieve an objective. Full understanding depends on people's use of their knowledge to deduce the goal structure that interrelates the participants' actions.



Remembering a message and answering questions about it are basic criteria of understanding. This research examines people's strategies for remembering messages, from trying to recall the precise details to recollecting the general sense. It also distinguishes these strategies from more automatic memory influences.



SIGNIFICANCE: The research bears on issues important to Canada and beyond: What are the factors that distinguish teenagers strong and weak in reading comprehension? Do older adults miss the implications of ordinary messages? What properties of an advertisement contribute to it misleading a reader? Are there differences among the understanding of scientific text, fiction, and other text genres? The research also bears on fundamental scientific questions ranging from false memory (text inferences are often ""falsely"" recognized) to representing the situation described in a message.

"The development of ""Green Chemistry"", or environmentally benign chemistry, is an area of increasing significance in today's society. Green Chemistry is aimed at the reduction or elimination of hazardous substances in the design, manufacture, application, and disposal of chemical products. These goals can be achieved, in part, by increasing reaction yields, rates, and selectivities. Other key components of any ""green"" process include the ability to recycle and reuse unused reactants, catalysts and solvents while avoiding release of harmful volatile organic compounds (VOC's).

     Room Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTILs) are a new class of polar, non-coordinating solvents that are typically composed of an organic cation and an inorganic anion and are liquids at or below room temperature. Our group is concerned with the exploitation of the beneficial ""green"" properties of these inherently non-volatile solvents. The four main areas of ionic liquid research that are making valuable contributions to industry and hence society are their development as replacement solvents, use in separations, catalysis, and new materials. Our overall program addresses all of these areas of interest  through our activities in  the four sub-categories of our program: (1) The design, synthesis, and characterization of new ionic liquids for use as alternative solvents and materials.; (2) Development of functionalized RTILs for use in metal separations or in the preparation of RTIL-metal complexes that have potential use as easily recycled, immobilized homogeneous catalysts for important organic reactions.; (3) Adaptation of bimetallic addition reactions with unsaturated substrates to RTIL systems.; (4) Organometallic synthetic methodology development. 

     RTILs will afford novel reaction conditions affording higher yields of single products while being recyclable and reusable. They are excellent candidates for replacements to industrially used solvents as reaction media, in separations and catalysis, and the development of new materials; herein RTILs have their highest potential impact.

"The most critical period influencing the success or failure of pregnancy is the first 7 days. More than 95% of oocytes (eggs) become fertilized after insemination (conception) but only 10-40% of them produce embryos. The reason for this high rate of attrition during early embryonic development is unclear, but is associated with the intrinsic status of the oocyte. The long-term objective of this research program is to elucidate the hormonal, cellular and molecular mechanisms that affect an oocyte's ability to develop into a viable embryo. This application is a logical extension of fruitful line of research established with NSERC funding. We developed the bovine model for the study of reproductive aging and documented that maternal aging in the bovine model is associated with a decrease in oocyte competence. Our recent results suggest that oocyte competence is also compromised when the life-span of a growing follicle is prolonged by even 3-4 days. In this grant, we want to address the fundamental biological question: How does oocyte dysfunction occur in vivo? Therefore, the focus of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms associated with loss of oocyte competence during follicular and maternal aging. Our overall working hypothesis is that the loss of oocyte competence is caused by similar cytoplasmic events during maternal and follicular aging while chromosomal dysfunctions are unique to maternal aging. The specific objectives of this grant are, to determine 1) the precise embryonic stage/event affected by follicular and maternal aging, 2) the role of chromosomal non-disjunctions and spindle defects during loss of oocyte competence, 3) if telomere shortening of oocyte chromosomes occurs with maternal aging and 4) the role of mitochondria in loss of oocyte competence. Information gained from studying the effects of follicular and maternal aging has broad clinical implications and is germane to the development of efficient assisted reproductive techniques for animals and humans. We anticipate that findings from the proposed work will allow direct improvements of existing reproductive management techniques in cattle such as, fixed-time artificial insemination, superovulation and embryo transfer.","Mechanisms affecting oocyte competence in the bovine model: effect of follicular and maternal aging","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal reproduction"
"Barley is a key ingredient in malting and brewing. Malt, produced from germinating barley is used for making alcoholic beverages. Brewing companies are the main consumers for barley malt. Malting quality is composed of a number of traits including percentage of malt extract, total grain protein, wort protein, ï¿½-glucan and kernel plumpness, a-amylase activity, kernel weight and diastatic power. Malting quality is an economically important phenotype but genetically complex.  Genetic improvement of malting quality is impaired by its quantitative nature and low heritability. A series of efforts have been undertaken to genetically dissect this trait and to localize individual quantitative trait loci (QTL) on the genetic map of barley. One major QTL complex, QTL2 mapped on the short arm of chromosome 4H, affects several malting quality parameters. We are saturating malting-quality QTL regions with transposons, commonly known as ""jumping genes"" to facilitate identification and characterization of genes associated with malting in the QTL2. This effort of saturation mutagenesis with transposons will lead to a better understanding of malting quality traits and candidate genes that display quantitative variation. Identification of the candidate genes harboured in this QTL will allow development of functional markers for breeding of malting barley.

"Pollution of water bodies such as lake, rivers, aquifers and oceans by inadequately treated municipal and industrial wastewater discharges is a major environmental concern. These discharges can adversely affect the quality of water resources and public health. There remains a need for more effective, sustainable, and economical post treatment/polishing methods that can be integrated into existing wastewater treatment infrastructures to produce superior quality effluent and to meet the stringent discharge criteria.



Application of anaerobic bioreactor technology for pretreatment/treatment of biodegradable municipal and industrial wastewaters is becoming popular, because of its inherent characteristics of low sludge production combined with the potential of net energy benefits through the production of biogas. However, presence of residual organics, high concentration of nutrients, solids and other contaminants of interest pose challenges for many of the treatment systems to meet typical discharge limits without an integration of efficient post-treatment/polishing system.



The proposed research will aim to study, develop and integrate an economical post-treatment system based on characterization of bioreactor effluents. The results of this research program are expected to provide a novel integrated sustainable wastewater treatment alternative for municipalities and industries in Canada and other countries for environmental pollution control.

"In many fields, like medicine, agriculture, industry, engineering, biological sciences, sociology, often situations involving sequences of similar but independent investigations arise. In such situations the parameter of interest often varies unpredictably as the sequence progresses with unknown probability distribution, and hence a minimum risk decision, what is usually called Baysian decision, can not be made. However, the information collected from the previous investigations can sometimes be utilized to formulate a decision, what is popularly known as empirical Bayes decision, with risk close to the minimum Bayes risk. Part of the objective of this research is to propose improved/monotone EB estimation/test procedures when the responses are modelled by some parametric distribution and to investigate the speed and the best possible speed with which the risk of these procedures approach to the minimum Bayes risk.

  When the response is the time-to-event outcome such as lifetimes of patients, failure times, the data are often censored and involve time dependent covariates. For example, in a clinical trial, the researchers are interested in evaluating the effect of a treatment on survival in the HIV-1 seropositive drug users adjusted for other predictive covariates such as BMI (body mess index) and age. Some patients may still be alive when the study terminates. Hence, the survival time of these patients are censored.  Part of the objective of this research proposal is to develop improved non/semi-parametric regression models for covariate effects with censored samples and to investigate the efficiency and the optimal convergence rates.

    )	In almost every discipline response data depend on several causal co-variates, and one is often faced with the problem of modelling the response data on these co-variates for forecasting/prediction purpose. This research proposal is in part to extend the methods of forecasting/prediction  without any specification of the functional form of the dependence (regression) of the responses on covariates, where these variables may be stochastically  (or time) dependent as in economics or may be life time data as in survival analysis.

"    )	For many decades, the problem of speciation has been refractory to detailed genetic analyses, however with the availability of an increasing number of sequenced genomes, expression data and transgenic methodology, the scientific community is now in a position to understand the origins and evolution of species. During the last tenure of our NSERC grant, our studies were specifically directed towards understanding molecular evolution of sex- and reproduction-related genes and their role in speciation. We showed that genes involved in reproduction are evolving faster than genes with other functions, and that sexual function (male-/female-biased) and chromosomal location (sex vs. non-sex) are major factors influencing rapid gene evolution. Our goal in the next phase is to use modern molecular methodology to to test the hypothesis that variation and evolution of sexual system genes through their effects on sexual dimorphism are responsible for the development of reproductive isolation and speciation. Large scale gene expression studies of sterile interspecific hybrids have highlighted the importance of regulatory sequences in controlling gene expression and their role in speciation. We will analyse the evolution of cis-regularory sequences involved in sex-, tissue- and developmental stage-specific functions. Transgenics, using coding an regulatory sequences of different species for selected candidate genes will be done. Finally, with a view to link molecules to morphology and to unravel the dynamics of natural and sexual selection for a sexual a trait, we have undertaken a comprehensive study of the evolution of the male sexual trait, the sex combs, in Drosophila species. Studies involving artificial selection, behavioural experiments and gene expression profiles of selected lines will provide an understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of this sexual trait which has evolved rapidly and independently in different groups of Drosophila species. The results will shed light on the origins of species as well as on the evolution of sexual system genes and the tempo of change during speciation.

"The long-term goal of this research is to uncover and understand mechanisms underlying regulation of eukaryotic genes using mouse as the model and train graduates in the field of genetics. The genes for this research have been identified by mouse expression arrays using brain RNA from two strains; C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. The results have established that the strains differ for ~2% of the genes. Besides the strain specific (SS) differences we have identified genes that are ethanol responsive (ER) and strain specific ethanol responsive (SSER). This variation is critical in adaptation including sensitivity to external challenges and allowed us to propose a genomics approach to link this variation to sensitivities and behaviours (Singh et al 2007).This proposal deals with two questions;



1. What regulates the ER and SSER genes in the mouse brain? and

2. What is the biological significance of SSER variarions in the brain? 



Hypothesis: The cis- and trans-factors involved in the regulation of genes are involved in the expression of SSER genes that play contribute to behaviours including ethanol preference (EP).



Methods and Results: The bioinformatics methods using complete genomic sequence of the two strains, >3 million SNPs and RI resources will be used to identify common cis-elements. They will be followed by specific studies on DNA methylation, gel shifts and transient expressions. The results will be assessed in cosegregation studies involving EP in genetic crosses, RI lines including knockouts (if available). The results will offer a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon of the regulation of gene expression in the mammalian system and its potential role in adaptation.

"A vast amount of our everyday behaviour involves the integration of our perceptions and memories from information encountered by our different senses.  For example, when we drive our car we must stay visually focused on many aspects of the road such as traffic, weather conditions, signage, pedestrians etc.  This can become even more complex if we are also listening to the radio, talking to a passenger, using a cell phone, or drinking a cup of coffee.  The work in my laboratory is primarily concerned with understanding how the brain is able to coordinate mental and physical activities that are required during complex behaviour.  



More specifically, this research investigates how human attention interacts with the memory and action systems during the planning and execution of everyday behaviour. This research employs two sophisticated neuroscience techniques that provide information about the specific brain areas underlying complex behaviour (functional MRI), as well as the timing of the relevant brain activity (event-related potentials).  One line of research will investigate how memory is involved in mediating divided attention, and what impact the sensory modality (e.g. vision vs. audition) of the incoming information has upon this relationship. A second line of research is intended to map out the areas of the brain that control delayed hand actions to remembered objects. 



This research will make theoretical and practical contributions to cognitive neuroscience. First, it will further our understanding of how the human brain organizes large amounts of task relevant information that comes from different sources. This will be of practical value to situations involving multitasking such as air traffic control.  Second, this work will further our understanding of how the brain controls everyday hand actions, which will have applications for neural prosthetic research, and treatment of individuals with motor control disorders.

"Cancer is a leading cause of death in Canada and it is expected to become even more prominent with Canada's aging population. Early detection is paramount to treating cancer successfully. Ovarian cancer, for instance, has a 95% survival rate with early detection, yet is commonly fatal as it is asymptomatic until late stages and there is a lack of effective screening technology. The lack of a single biomarker, or indicator, for most cancers indicates effective early detection of cancer will require analysis of a sample over an array of biosensors in an integrated device. The goal of this project is to develop a practical and effective integrated device for cancer diagnostics. To achieve this goal, the project integrates the forefront of label-free nanohole array based biosensing, microfluidic processing, and established ovarian cancer biomarkers with a novel flow-through-array architecture. The integrated device, a combination of chip and reader, is expected to outperform current biomedical methods for early cancer detection with respect to sensitivity, with additional benefits of lab-on-chip miniaturization. The proposed research program takes advantage of the team's early demonstrations and expertise in nanophotonics sensing technology and lab-on-chip integration. Central to the work is the involvement and support of the BC Cancer Deeley Research Centre, and their on-going work in developing reagents for identified ovarian cancer biomarkers, as well as industrial supporting organizations. The work will involve three concurrent stages: the optimization of the nanophotonic sensing and optical instrumentation; the immobilization of capture antibodies on the nanohole array structures and validation; and development of sample preparation and delivery fluidics with a flow-through-array architecture. The goal of this device development work is to lay the way for a practical and effective cancer screening technology, to the social and economic benefit of Canadians.","Targeting the early detection of cancer with lab-on-chip nanohole sensors","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Fluid mechanics"

"Light and matter:  How do they interact?  This is a research program to investigate some of the quantum mechanical subtleties of photons and electrons -- the particles of light and electricity -- that arise in condensed matter when there are many photons around and the light is very intense.  

    )	Quantum mechanics allows different possibilities to interfere with each other, just as water waves can, and employing this kind of interference we can use light to send electrons in one direction or another as we choose.  But these funny interference properties can be destroyed - or at least hidden -- if the little part of nature we are trying to control interacts with other parts.  How does this happen in real, complicated systems where one can't really separate the different parts?

    )	If intense light is in a solid, where there are electrons around, some of the photons can split into two photons.  These new photons are ""entangled,"" neither photon really being quite independent of the other even if they propagate kilometres away from each other.  So they are a resource for processing information. Can these entangled photons be made more easily, and what types can be made?  How weak a light source can we have and still make them?

    )	As material and laser science progresses, leading to smaller and smaller solid state structures and shorter and shorter optical pulses, these kinds of issues will be crucial as photonics and electronics merge into a single field that may have a profound impact on both our science and technology.

"We hypothesize that the interactions among salivary proteins protect complex partners from proteolysis, modulate the biological activity of complexed proteins or serve as a delivery system for the distribution of secretory salivary proteins throughout the oral cavity. Since no detailed analyses of the salivary protein complexes present in whole saliva and salivary gland secretions have been carried out yet, these roles will be investigated in detail in the current proposal. State-of-the-art proteomics will be used, in combination with classical protein-protein interaction methods, to provide a greater understanding of the biological function of salivary protein complexes. 



The proposed study will investigate interactions among the major salivary proteins (mucins, amylase, histatins, statherin, lysozyme, lactoferrin and PRPs) and the remaining salivary proteins present in whole saliva, parotid and submandibular/sublingual secretions by using mass spectrometric techniques. The biological function of the identified salivary complexes will be explored by assaying demineralization of enamel, bacterial/fungal growth inhibition and killing, etc.

 

Our studies will provide the foundation for more extensive studies in the characteristics and functions of vertebrate salivary protein complexes. Furthermore, salivary complexes formed with proteins such as histatins and PRPs are of considerable importance for the Canadian agricultural sector since those proteins have a high affinity for dietary polyphenolic compounds (tannins), which may interfere with the growth and well-being of livestock. Therefore a better understanding of the physiology of those salivary proteins can ultimately lead to an improved health of farm animals.

"Although major advances were made recently in the field of reproductive technologies, we are still far from understanding all the molecular events that regulate and control the quality of eggs that will develop into healthy embryos. Recent studies clearly established that oocytes acquire their capability to be fertilized and produce good embryos inside the ovary during follicular growth and final maturation. During this period, different molecules and signals are transmitted from follicular cells to the oocyte to bring it to this high level of competence. However, with the new protocols used today, this final maturation of the oocyte takes place in vitro, far away from its natural environment, the follicle. Even if some benefits are pulled out from this in vitro maturation, we are still unable to bring the oocyte to the level of competence that is reached within the follicle. A lower number of embryos produced in vitro is the usual consequence. Therefore, it is very important to identify these signals sent by the follicle to improve our in vitro maturation media and conditions. Our team of high qualified scientists from university and industry has built an impressive number of tools ,both physiological and molecular to explore this unique signalling cascade. This project will allow the identification of the missing pieces for the global comprehension of the mechanisms used by the follicle to bring the oocyte to its higher level of competence. It will then be possible to transpose these winning conditions to our in vitro maturation systems with the objective of mimicking conditions which are crucial to the oocytes during their final growth and maturation. We believe that this will result in a significant increase in the number and quality of embryos produced, which is very important for a country like the Canada where genetic exportation has huge economical consequences.

"This research program is exploring the most extraordinary cell of the body, the oocyte.  Indeed this cell has unique capacities and properties.  Firstly, this cell does not age as other cells in our body and has the ability to rejuvenate an adult cell when fused with it.  Secondly this cell controls the early embryonic development and this is the focus of this research program.  We know that the ovary controls the quality of the oocyte which is represented by its ability to become an embryo.  It is not known though how this happens. In animals, the cow for example, drugs are used to stimulate the ovulation of several eggs to accelerate the dissemination of good genetics, especially in dairy cows.  The environment, especially the nutritional status of the animal also influences the oocyte/embryo quality by a mechanism still unknown.  Using new molecular tools like DNA microarrays it is now possible to explore the gene regulation (thousands at a time) and expression in oocytes exposed to the different conditions described above in order to grasp the functioning of this unique cell. This program is interested by the special maternal instructions that are imbedded in the egg to proceed to create a whole animal.  These instructions are coded in maternal messenger RNA that is stabilized for several days. This code is simply unknown at this time, but from it depends the quality of the egg.  The benefits of this research will be an increase in fertility in cows and indirectly in other species as the oocyte mysteries seems conserved in large mammals.","Molecular green light to next generation","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal reproduction"

".     Plant cell cultures have a high potential for the production of pharmaceuticals from which 25% are derived from plant-origin molecules. The annual market is of the order of 3 billion $US in United-States. Although the production of these molecules by plant cell culture has proven to be technically feasible, very few commercial successes have been realized. This can be explained by cell culture technologies which are poorly adapted to industrial requirements and by a lack of basic information on plant cell pathways. There is an important need to develop characterization tools to study metabolic pathways as an integrated system rather than individually. The general objective of my program is to develop and validate efficient tools for systemic and integrated characterization and optimisation of plant cell metabolism in cell cultures for the development of industrial bioprocesses. The elaboration of my program is based on an original integrated approach for bioprocess development: It proposes the simultaneous realization of characterization, modeling and optimization; It integrates the three phases of plant cell culture; It uses an original simplified structure called ""metabolic units"".

.     Characterization of plant cell metabolism will be realized by measuring the concentration of intracellular metabolites over culture time. New high throughput technologies for cell culture (mini-bioreactors) and analysis (plate reader) will be employed to maximize research efficacy by reducing culture volumes and increasing the number of replicates. Results generated by cell cultures will be manipulated using mathematical models to synthesize, organize and exploit this information. In parallel, two sets of optimization algorithms will be developed to predict profiles of nutrients supply, and for real-time readjustment of nutrient supply along the culture. This program will lead to an optimized bioprocess for the production of benzophenanthridine alkaloids from Eschscholtzia californica plant cell suspensions. The main originalities of the program are to study all phases of metabolite production by plant cell cultures as a whole integrated production process using ""metabolic units"", and to the exploit up-to-date culture and online measurement technologies.

"Interactive virtual reality simulators are becoming increasingly realistic by incorporating sensing modalities such as vision, kinesthesia and force feedback, also known as haptics. Interactions with non-rigid deformable objects often occur in medical applications involving biological soft-tissue. While a great deal of progress has been made in physics-based mathematical modeling of these interactions, practical applications of such models in real-time simulations have remained limited mainly due to their computational complexity. In particular, applications with haptic feedback would require very high simulation update rates to maintain the system stability, imposing strict timing constraints beyond the capabilities of existing single-processor computers. Building upon our previous work in haptics, this research explores a new paradigm in parallel computing for real-time high-fidelity simulation of soft-object interaction involving visual and haptic feedback. Customized computing tools will be developed that concurrently employ thousands of processing units to solve a large sparse system of equations arising from the finite element models of soft-object deformation. The solution will be obtained at sufficiently high update rates for simulation stability and fidelity. These computing tools will be essentially parallel implementations of recursive equation solvers on synthesized hardware architectures using the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. Massive parallelization of the computations on multiple interconnected FPGA chips will provide enormous computing power in an inexpensive and compact package enabling the simulation of high-fidelity soft-tissue deformation models. The results of this research will be instrumental in the development of the next generation of computer-assisted surgical systems and medical training simulators. The integration of the resulting core computational technologies into such systems will create improved and new operational capabilities in computer-assisted medical training, diagnosis, and planning and execution of medical interventions. Other scientific applications requiring fast solutions to sparse linear systems of equations will also benefit from this research.

"Explosive and significant advances in proteomics have been made possible by innovative technological breakthroughs and conceptual developments in biological mass spectrometry (MS). Two key technological areas that are the foundations of protein identification in MS are ion generation and collision-induced dissociation (CID) of peptides. Our proposed research continues to aim at better understanding the fundamentals of these reactions and processes, as well as the structures and energetics of the resulting ions.  This knowledge is important for eventually more accurate and efficient protein sequencing and identification, especially in applications to discover and identify disease biomarkers.  In particular, our objectives are to explore the structures, energetics, formation, and fragmentation chemistries of (i) molecular radical cations of oligopeptides; these ions differ from the neutral peptides by having one fewer electron, have structures and properties that are different from their protonated counterparts, and provide unique information when subject to CID-induced gas-phase microsequencing; and (ii) metalated peptides and ternary complexes; metalation imparts unique and interesting structures and chemistries to the peptides.  The proposed investigations will be carried out by means of a combination of experiments, including tandem MS, threshold CID measurements, infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy, and DFT calculations.  Tandem MS experiments will be conducted on prototype and/or commercially available mass spectrometers, including triple-quadrupole, linear ion trap, and three-dimensional ion trap.

"This proposal is for renewal of a third term of the NSERC / MDS Analytical Technologies Industrial Research Chair in Analytical Mass Spectrometry. This IRC conducts research in developing novel hardware in mass spectrometry (MS) and applications in collaboration with MDS Analytical Technologies (AT, formerly SCIEX), the Industrial Partner. This proposal for renewal comprises ongoing collaborative projects and new projects developed with MDS AT. As in current practice, many of these projects will be carried out in both the Chair's laboratories in York University and his collaborators' laboratories in MDS AT. Siu's graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and MDS AT staff will be able to conduct research in both locations, facilitated by the short physical separation (-15 minutes by car) between the two collaborating institutions. A significant portion of the Chair's research program will be devoted to understanding and developing of new ion dissociation methods and instrumentation. These include infrared multiphoton dissociation, implemented for the first time in a hybrid quadrupole / time-of-flight (QqTOF) mass spectrometer (a prototype of the MDS AT QSTAR) by the Chair's team; and ultraviolet dissociation, a new project whose preliminary data show considerable promise. Results of this research will lead to a better understanding of the potential of these dissociation methods for implementation on the QqTOF and other types of MS/MS instrumentation that are manufactured by MDS AT, and may lead to commercial products. Equally significant are projects devoted to better quantitative analyses of peptide and small-molecule drugs. These projects include investigations into multiple-reaction monitoring, the use of a differential mobility analyzer and the enhanced multiply charge scan for improved selectivity in fast separations, and ion parking for simplifying ion distributions from the perspective of enhancing quantification. In addition, efforts will be devoted to apply ion mobility spectrometry in a novel instrumentation developed during the second Chair term that integrates ion mobility and triple quadrupole MS for drug metabolite characterization that complements MS.","NSERC/MDS Analytical Technologies Industrial Research Chair in Analytical Mass Spectrometry","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Bioanalytical chemistry"

"Medical healthcare is clearly becoming a priority on many government agendas. One of the enormous challenges facing the medical community is how to organise and extract useful knowledge from the enormous amount of information gathered from basic science experiments and clinical trials. Mathematical models are playing an increasingly central role in this endeavour and will therefore be an integral part of biomedical discoveries of the future. New research paradigms for the modelling of physiological events and the development of computer simulations have enabled theoretical concepts to become practical medical tools. Some of these mathematically-based tools, such as surgical training simulators, have revolutionised clinical management and treatment, and have led to decreased mortality and healthcare costs. Brain injury, is a frequent outcome in a range of disease processes and leads to disabilities that are emotionally devastating and costly from a societal viewpoint. The development of an accurate mathematical model suitable for the simulation of the mechanical behaviour of the brain, will be an important milestone in the clinical neurosciences because it will help to predict the damage sustained by the brain in a variety of circumstances and aid in treatment decisions. The identification of major factors that influence treatment response in brain and other cancerous tumours has been a problem of longstanding interest and relevance to clinical oncology. Whilst conventional treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy have contributed to major advances in the management and control of cancer, there is still room for significant further improvement. Thus the combination of mathematical modelling and novel computational methods, validated using experimental and clinical data, provides a powerful new tool in biomedical research. My research program is directed at using mathematical/computational modelling to study problems arising in medicine with a view to developing models of clinical relevance and use. I attempt to understand and model clinical conditions such as hydrocephalus, as well as tumour growth and control at a more fundamental level using continuum mechanics.

"Behaviour of soils is typically assessed under either fully drained or fully undrained conditions, and along specific loading paths. However, in reality the deformation is dependent on the three dimensional stress state that exists in the field, and would invariably involve simultaneous changes in both pore volume and pore pressure.

The drained, and undrained approximations work well under certain situations, but may not yield satisfactory results when evaluating the post-earthquake response of soils. A proper characterization should consider the fact that both pore volume and pressure change simultaneously in actual field problems. The proposed experimental research will provide an insight into the shear-deformation characteristics of soils when subjected to simultaneous changes in pore volume and pressure. Triggering of liquefaction will be considered not only due to undrained loading, but also due to pore water migration.

Seismic provisions in the new National Building Code of Canada (NBCC2005) are stricter, and designers will have to deal with higher levels of earthquake shaking. The empirical approach typically used to evaluate cyclic resistance is based on data at lower shaking levels than those specified by NBCC2005. Proposed research will contribute to this aspect by studying the effect of three dimensional stress state on the cyclic resistance of soils, and on the post-cyclic deformation characteristics. Outcome of the research will allow us to evaluate current

design methodologies, and propose improved cyclic resistance assessment techniques. Better understanding of the rheology of the liquefied soils is key to confidently predict earthquake induced displacements.

There is significant potential for economic benefits if current practice is determined to be conservative.  Proposed research will improve our understanding of the mechanical behaviour of soils, and enhance the reliability of numerical models, and current design methodologies. It will lead to more confident designs, and economic solutions.

"This research program will develop novel and practically implementable technologies involving advanced device architectures and nanotechnology concepts and combine them with silicon (Si) wafer-based photovoltaic (PV) technologies to demonstrate high efficiency (>25%) PV devices. The research aims at overcoming some fundamental performance limits of Si solar cells by broadening the harvestable range of solar spectrum via implementation of spectral engineering concepts. Several advanced device configurations including thin films, nanostructures, and quantum dots, in combination with wafer-based technologies, will be developed and demonstrated.



The major components of this far-reaching 5-year research program are; (1) Development of low temperature Si thin films with high crystallinity and controlled doping, (2) Simplified, mask-less fabrication method for Si nanowires (NW) in a top-down process resulting in size-controllable, removable, and manipulable crystalline NWs; (3) Development of Si quantum dot arrays in a relatively simple technology that is easily implementable for PV cells, (4) Development of techniques for polymeric layer embedment of optically tuned CdSe quantum dots and Si NWs for device level deployment; (5) Design and fabrication of a new 3-terminal PV device involving epitaxial thin films combined with Si substrates; (6) Development of a simple methodology to form arrays of Si quantum dots for bandgap modification; and (7) Demonstration of new high efficiency PV cell architectures on Si wafer platforms with photon shifting layers of nanowires and quantum dots.  



The proposed work will result PV devices with demonstrated efficiencies exceeding 25% in Si wafer devices, and, more importantly, through techniques that are simple and up-scalable. The research outcome is expected to enable transfer of the new technologies to manufacturing levels in the short-to-medium term.

"Imagine being able to actually watch - at the atomic level - the progress of a chemical reaction, or the atomic rearrangements taking place in materials during a phase transition.  The human eye won't be much help - nor will a light-microscope - since atoms are only one ten-millionth of a millimeter in size.  To compound the difficulty, during a chemical reaction atomic motions can occur in one trillionth of a second; much too fast for the eye or any video camera to capture.  Such a view of the microsocpic world requires a special 'molecular movie' camera that can see atoms and operate at frame-rates faster than the atomic motions (so that they don't become blurred).  This proposal seeks to develope this 'molecular movie camera'.  The approach is based on uniting the tools and techniques of transmission electron microscopy with those of ultrafast laser spectroscopy.  There will be many technological applications, particularly in those fields that attempt to harness atomic motions in molecules and materials for electronic and advance materials applicaitons.  For the first time we will be able to actually see what the atoms are doing.","Ultrafast structural dynamics at atomic resolution","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Physical chemistry"

"Genetic information is stored in the cell in the form of DNA, which the cell cannot access directly. Instead, DNA information undergoes extensive, multi-step processing before it can be acted upon to direct cellular functions. One of these processes, alternative mRNA splicing, not only transmits genetic information but also enhances it by generating multiple alternative genetic messages from the same gene. The cell expands considerable amount of resources to generate these alternative messages and while some are essential for the proper functioning and development of the cell, the significance of others is a subject of great debate, since their function in the cell is unclear.  Is alternative splicing an extravagantly inefficient process, an intricately complex regulatory process, or a powerful evolutionary mechanism? The answer to these questions have important implications about how genetic information is organized and evolves.

In this study we will attempt to evaluate the significance of alternative messages by comparing their production in a variety of animals including primates, other mammals, birds, fish, and amphibians. Our guiding principle is that if alternative messages are functionally important then we will be able to trace their evolutionary development and uncover evidence of their role in the various animals we will investigate.

"The equipment requested is a miniature spectrometer reflectometer system for measuring the thickness of films deposited onto surfaces.  The technique is non-destructive and the thickness of the film deposited onto the substrate can be measured to with 1 nm accuracy based on the light absorbed and reflected from the surface.  The instrument can measure the thickness of polymer films and brushes on transparent surfaces such as ITO electrodes and mica substrates.  The instrument allows polymer thickness-properties studies of conjugated polymers for electrochromic applications as well as polymer brushes for biorelated applications.  Such thickness-properties studies are important for understanding the relationship of conjugated polymer thickness with device efficiency and color contrasting for electrochromic devices.  The reflectometer will also allow crucial studies of polymer brush height on mica substrates for correlating surface friction, electrostatic interactions, and entanglement with polymer brush thickness.

"A series of new polymers using azomethine connections are proposed as photoactive materials in photovoltaic

devices. These polymers will be prepared by condensing novel diamino and dialdehyde monomers. Selective

condensation of these complementary functional groups will afford highly conjugated polyazomethines. The

capacity of these polymers to undergo photoinduced charge/hole transfer will be examined and their suitability

to replace standard conjugated polymers in photovoltaic devices will be investigated. Crucial structure-property

relationships including the change in HOMO-LUMO energy levels, band-gaps (Eg), singlet excited state

energy, and photoinduced electron transfer efficiencies as a function of molecular weight and by incorporating

different heterocyclic monomer into the polyazomethines will be examined. Photovoltaic devices

incorporating the polyazomethines as photoactive materials that are both self-assembled as monolayers on ITO

electrodes and conventional bulk-heterojunctions will be constructed. High efficiencies with these devices are

expected. Since the proposed polyazomethines exhibit controllable molecular weight, consistent product

formation and easy synthesis, cost-effective organic photovoltaic devices relative to their analogues are

expected with these new polyazomethines. Therefore, cheaper organic photovoltaic devices are expected by

using photoactive derived materials derived from the proposed polyazomethines.","New self-assembled polyazomethines for photovoltaic devices","Energy storage and conversion",CANADA,CANADA,"Polymer characterization"
"Conjugated organic materials are desired targets for applications in organic light emitting diodes and molecular wires for possessing optical, emitting, and conducting properties. Contingent on structure, conjugated organic materials which exhibit these properties can be used for applications in flexible light displays and low power consumption products, including inexpensive field effect transitors. The synthesis of conjugated organic materials has, however, not been a simple process. Conventional synthetic methods have required multiple steps and challenging purifications to isolate the desired conjugated materials. In recent years, our laboratories have developed new methodologies for the efficient synthesis of monomers used for inherently conducting polymers (ICPs). We present an alternative synthetic route to access novel comonomers and functional polymers for application as organic light emitting diodes. We have also found mild conditions for condensation chemistry to conveniently make novel conjugated polyazomethines, which are expected to exhibit a better range of physical properties than conventional conjugated polymers. With effective access to novel comonomers, we now propose to employ these building blocks in the mild condensation process to prepare a unique series of conjugated materials. The targeted conjugated organic materials will possess physical properties that are tuned for applications in optical and electronic devices.","Novel pi-conjugated materials for emitting devices","Materials sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Polymer synthesis"
"Conjugated materials have gained a wide importance because of their physical properties making them ideal for emitting devices and plastic electronics. Among the most attractive properties are their low oxidation potentials and photo- and electrochemically excited states affording suitable emissions for electronic devices. Unfortunately, the preparation of these desired materials requires stringent reaction conditions using metal catalysts that are problematic to remove. Furthermore, the coupling methods used to prepare such materials lead to inconsistent products with unreliable properties. Azomethines (-N=C-) comonomers are ideal alternatives because they are easily formed without stringent reaction conditions with consistent product formation. When using aryl precursors, the resulting bond is hydrolytically, reductively, and oxidatively resistant. What is proposed is the synthesis of novel comonomers containing 2 or 3 covalently linked thiophenes containing terminal amines. This affords amino bithiophene and terthiophene derivatives that can be condensed with various aromatic aldehydes affording highly conjugated compounds. Given the importance of thiophene as a precursor for conjugated polymers, the synthesis of 2,2'-diaminoterthiophene is proposed using the Gewald reaction starting from 2,5-thiophene carbaldehyde. The well established substitution chemistry of thiophene is proposed to synthesize various 2,2'-diaminoterthiophene derivatives. Various electron donors and withdrawing groups can be easily incorporated into the 3 and 4 positions allowing the fine tuning of the physical properties in addition to increasing the solubility. The condensation of the various precursors with fluorene and thiophene dialdehydes will be pursued. The resulting physical properties including the redox potentials, fluorescence quantum yields, the excited state lifetimes, anodic electropolymerization, and spectroelectrochemistry are proposed.

"The human hippocampus plays a vital role in memory, particularly episodic memory. In animals, this same structure is critical for spatial learning and memory. The main goal of my research program is to understand the behavioral strategies used by animals in spatial learning and navigation, with the ultimate goal of finding commonalities in hippocampal function across species. Animals have a variety of strategies available to locate themselves and other objects in their spatial environment. They can approach a single cue (i.e., beacon) that predicts the location of a goal, they can use the relationship among multiple cues in the environment, they can go in a particular direction (i.e., west), they can use information obtained in the process of self-movement (path integration), or they can use the shape/geometry of their environment. My recent work suggests that orientation (or direction) and surface properties of an apparatus are particularly important to successful spatial learning. The aim of the present research proposal is to understand how these factors interact to produce successful navigation in animals.","Role of orientation and surface properties in spatial learning",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Behavioural neuroscience --learning"

"Nanosatellite missions are becoming increasingly popular for proving space technologies. Potential exists for a range of applications including earth observation and mobile communication systems. In order to keep costs of such missions low, navigation and attitude determination systems are generally based on off-the-shelf components. Such components are not necessarily optimized for space applications, however, and a need exists to develop a navigation receiver and attitude determination capabilities specifically for nanosatellite applications. In the case of navigation capabilities, GNSS receivers must be small, lightweight, low-cost, and have low power consumption. In this project Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers will be designed for nanosatellite applications, with onboard orbit determination to aid receiver tracking and acquisition. Novel methods for space-borne atmospheric profiling using this receiver (based on radio occultations) will be developed taking advantage of new GNSS signals. In particular, the addition of civilian dual-frequency capabilities to the GPS Block IIR-M satellites will be exploited to improve performance near the lower and upper atmosphere boundaries. Attitude determination capabilities will be developed using the latest MEMS sensor technologies, specialized for nanosatellite implementation. This work will be conducted in partnership with the Canadian Space Agency and industrial partner NovAtel Inc.

"We propose to develop a collection of interactive electronic garments constructed out of a new generation of composite fibers that are able to harness power directly from the human body, store that energy, and then use it to change their own visual properties. These animated garments will change color and illuminate on the body ir response to physical movement. The core technical innovation involves shifting this functionality entirely within the fiber itself. The core artistic innovation involves the creation of a conceptual framework around issues of power consumption and sustainability by creating body-worn, textile-based, parasitic artifacts that draw energy directly from the movement of the human body and use that energy to shift and modulate their physical appearance. The technical goal of our project is to develop a prototype for an all-fiber based textile that can harness, sense, and display energy. Conceptually, this constitutes a radical deviation from the dominan model of a textile substrate with integrated mechano-electronics to a fully integrated composite substrate, wherein the fibers themselves (a) harness human-generated energy, (b) store the energy directly inside the fibers, and (c) use that energy to control a fiber-based actuator (such as fiber illumination and color). We are particularly interested in the beauty of the human form, and its movement, specifically looking at athletes and dancers (of all ages) and the level of mastery they achieve in moving their bodies through space in the most efficient way to realize goals such as increased performance, beauty, or pleasure. How can such movements generate power and alter the visual qualities of costumes worn on the bodies? We propose to develop both highly utilitarian applications and demonstrators as well as very poetic, artistic, and critical outcomes. The former will serve to quickly illustrate the state of the art to a scientific and industrial audience. Building on these simple demonstrators, the latter will open the field of inquiry to question the assumptions of science and industry, to provide social, political, and cultural criticism, as well as develop new models for the use and misuse of these technologies.","Karma chameleon: minimally invasive interactive textiles for dynamic personalities","Fibres and textiles",CANADA,CANADA,"Materials science and technology"
"The broader goal of this project is to develop Canadian know-how for the fabrication of chalcogenide glass

Photonic Crystal Fibers (PCF) for the applications in the mid-IR (wavelengths 2-12um) high power beam

guiding, supercontinuum generation, fiber lasing, and sensing, which represent either existing or fast growing

multi-national markets waiting for immediate solutions. Although many practical applications were suggested

for the mid-IR PCFs, few experimental prototypes were demonstrated due to the lack of actual fiber. This, by

itself, opens an opportunity for the high-impact academic research, generation of novel Intellectual Property

(IP), and industrial licensing for the research group that can fabricate such PCFs in a timely manner. Another,

more specific, goal of this project is related to the existent, market driven need of the Canadian industry to

develop hollow core photonic bandgap fiber for the applications requiring high power delivery of high quality

CO2 beams for industrial cutting, medical surgery, and military. In the past fifteen years a considerable effort

was put by the leading optical research centers to develop silica PCF fabrication technology mostly for

telecommunication and sensing applications. Such fibers have already revolutionized light transmission in the

visible-to-near IR spectral ranges (0.4-2.0um). Due to low material loss and high nonlinearity of chalcogenide

glasses in the mid-IR, chalcogenide-based PCFs can, similarly to silica PCFs, revolutionize light management

in the mid-IR region. In the framework of this project our industrial partner CorActive Inc. will be responsible

for the synthesis of application specific chalcogenide glass, while EPM will research a multitude of

experimental techniques for the forming of chalcogenide glass into high purity microstructured fiber preforms,

which will then be drawn into fibers. The overall structure of the project is planned in such a way as to

accommodate both the industrial partner immediate need for the hollow core PCFs for CO2 laser transmission,

as well as to result in the high impact academic research related to the development of a variety of PCFs for the

applications in mid-IR linear and nonlinear guidance, fiber-lasing, sensing, and high power transmission.","Design and fabrication of the chalcogenide glass-based photonic crystal fibers for mid-IR laser power transmission applications","Manufacturing processes and products",CANADA,CANADA,"Materials processing"
"Design and fabrication of Photonic Crystal Fibers (PCFs) is currently booming due to a number of fundamental, yet practical discoveries that were made in this field including: supercontinuum generation, hollow core guidance of light at virtually any wavelength, bi-stable switching, fiber lasers at exotic wavelengths, compact and ultra-sensitive integrated plasmonic sensors, etc. Moreover, it is widely recognized that photonic crystal fiber fabrication technology is the most mature compared to the fabrication technologies of 2D and 3D photonic crystals. Therefore, PCFs present a unique platform for making groundbreaking fundamental discoveries, while also bringing such discoveries to commercialization in short-to-medium term.

        Our global objective is to exploit the key advantages offered by the PCFs and Photonic Crystals (PCs), in general, to enable novel fundamental and applied applications related to the flexible light delivery and its use in compact and ultra-sensitive sensors anywhere form the visible to THz frequency range. A strong focus in my group is on the development of industrial strength fabrication techniques for potential commercialization of the discovered PCFs and PCs. As a direct result of the last Discovery Grant we have established the following promising applied research objectives which we would like to continue exploring:

 I. Short term. Design and fabrication of the plastic Photonic Band Gap fibers for applications in (a) short-range data communications, (b) label-free sensing in the visible and near-IR. 

II. Medium term. Design and fabrication of (a) photonic crystal waveguide-based Surface Plasmon Resonance sensors for portable bio-chemical sensing in the visible and near IR, (b) highly porous, sub-wavelength, and hollow core PCFs for low loss guidance of the mid-IR and THz light. 

III. Long term. Investigation of the use of ferroelectric polymers and nano ceramic impregnated polymers for the design of mid-IR and THz (a) PCFs and PCs, (b) pseudo-plasmonic sensors.

"Mathematical models such as the self-avoiding walk and percolation are of considerable interest in statistical mechanics, probability theory, and combinatorics.  These models have been studied for about half a century, and remain a fascinating source of problems for mathematicians.  They have also been studied by physicists and chemists, as models of polymer molecules and of phase transition.  Their significance for mathematics is currently greater than ever, and the subject is flourishing.



The main mathematical problem is to prove theorems which shed light on the critical exponents and critical scaling limits which govern the large scale behaviour of these models.  An important mathematical method for such problems is the so-called lace expansion, and one thrust of this proposal is to further develop and apply the lace expansion to these and other problems.  Another important mathematical method for such problems is the renormalization group.  A second thrust of this proposal is to develop a new and flexible mathematically rigorous approach to the renormalization group, and to apply it to study 4-dimensional self-avoiding walks.

"Over the last decade, we have witnessed a remarkable convergence of the experimental and computational sciences. On the one hand, experimentalists can now visualize, manipulate and study single molecules such as DNA or proteins or build nanoscopic systems made of a very small number of molecules. One even has nanofluidic systems where nano-channels are filled with liquids. On the other hand, theoreticians now possess the theoretical and computational tools to study the very same systems, molecule by molecule. This convergence opens incredible possibilities in a number of disciplines, including analytical biochemistry and separation sciences. In this proposal, we propose to make significant contribution to various problems related to the dynamics of polymeric molecules (such as DNA) and nanofluidics: 



(1) We will use molecular-level computer simulations to study micro- and nanofluidic systems used to separate and analyze DNA and proteins (i.e., lab-on-a-chip systems). 

(2) We will continue the development of our revolutionary lattice model of diffusion and gel electrophoresis. We will extent our work to study the separation of biomolecules with high electric fields, ratchet systems, pulsed field electrophoresis, networks of cavities (similar to soil), drug-delivery systems, etc. 

(3) We will continue the study and development of new electrophoresis-based technologies. In particular, we will examine the new polymer matrices used in sequencing instruments.

(4) We will model the growth on bacterial colonies using a novel Monte Carlo algorithm that treat cells as autonomous agents.



Our work is thus at the interfaces between condensed matter physics, analytical chemistry, biotechnology, computational science, and biophysics.

These research questions span a wide range from: i) understanding microbial roles in controlling the persistence, impacts and remediation of organic contaminants on human and ecosystem health in the fields of environmental geochemistry, contaminant hydrogeology, microbiology and bioremediation; to ii) understanding the fundamental role played by microbial communities in global biogeochemical cycles and their influence in geological weathering, biogeochemical nutrient cycling and climate change; to iii) understanding human responses and development as they interact with their environment by new research combining scientific approaches in geochemistry with archeology to elucidate human development.

This proposal will apply CSIA lipids to the range of topics listed above to contribute to our understanding of each of these topics and as such adding to the overall understanding of human interactions with our environment such that we can plan for the future by understanding the microbial processes and their potential fundamental role in crucial environmental questions concerning impacts and remediation of contaminants and climate change, and by understanding the geoarcheological record of human responses to environmental change to contribute to our ability tot predict our future responses.

"My research deals with the inverse problem of seismic ray theory rooted in the theory of elasticity, and consisting of obtaining parameters characterizing the subsurface using seismological measurements. In the context of seismic ray theory, the measurements are traveltimes and polarizations of the seismic signal. A convenient experimental setup for such observations is provided by vertical seismic profiles with receivers located in the wellbores and the sources located on the surface, or with both sources and receivers located in the neighbouring wellbores.



Since the described research program focuses on the mathematical underpinnings of seismic investigations and their computational implementation, the results might suggest new paths of theoretical and computational investigations, such as the investigations of complex media in reservoir characterization.



The proposed project contributes to the understanding of geophysical theory and to the enhancement of evaluation, exploration and exploitation of oil and gas reservoirs, and hence to the lessening of their environmental impact.

"An active program of research on subsurface processes has been established in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Toronto. The focus of the research is the transport of pathogens in the subsurface, and the development of innovative methods for remediation of groundwater contamination. In particular, projects are ongoing or planned on pathogen transport in fractured rock, bioremediation of organic compounds in fractured rock, and remediation of chlorinated solvent contamination with nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI). In all of these projects attachment and detachment processes are of fundamental importance, whether it be bacteria and viruses in pathogen transport, biofilms in bioremediation, or NZVI in chlorinated solvent remediation.

    )	Funds are requested to purchase a quartz crystal microbalance system with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). This microbalance system can be used to measure attachment and detachment of nanogram masses to model surfaces and can also characterize the viscoelastic properties of the attached substances. In the proposed research the QCM-D system will be used to improve the understanding of the interactions of pathogens (bacteria and viruses), nanoparticles (particularly NZVI) with soil and fractured rock surfaces. In addition, biofilm processes relevant to bioremediation of hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents will be studied. The proposed equipment will allow real-time continuous monitoring of these processes providing insights not possible with currently available equipment that requires intrusive destructive sampling. The advances possible with the proposed equipment will benefit Canadians through the development of improved methods for protection of human health and the environment. The proposed equipment will be heavily used and will contribute signfiicantly to the training of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.

"Thermal remediation methods include hot water flushing, steam flushing (SF), electrical resistance heating (ERH), and thermal conductive heating (TCH). To date, there has been little research conducted on thermal remediation in highly heterogeneous subsurface systems (e.g. Smithville fractured rock site), either at the lab or field scale, or with numerical modelling. Prediction of rate limited mass transfer associated with the removal of multicomponent nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPL) by thermal remediation, particularly NAPL containing both high and low volatility organic compounds is also not currently well understood.

    )	The overall objective of the research is to determine the effectiveness of SF, ERH, and TCH for removal of multicomponent NAPL sources from heterogeneous soils, fractured clay, and fractured rock systems. In particular, the effectiveness of the three thermal remediation methods for removing specific components of the multicomponent NAPL source and the associated sorbed and aqueous phase organic compounds from the low permeability regions will be determined. Changes in soil properties during heating will be determined and related to removal rates. Mass transfer limitations with respect to removal of specific organic components from multicomponent NAPL by thermal remediation will be characterized. The potential for downward mobilization of dense NAPL with the three thermal remediation techniques for various hydrogeological settings will also be determined. The research will involve bench scale thermal remediation studies and computer modelling. 

    )	This research will make significant contributions to the understanding of the impact of heat on mass transfer from multicomponent NAPL source zones in complex heterogeneous systems. This will allow more realistic evaluations of the effectiveness of the various thermal remediation methods for site remediation. As the uncertainty in these processes is currently a barrier to implementation of thermal remediation methods, it is expected that this will lead to more widespread application of thermal remediation methods, resulting in cleanup of more sites not amenable to remediation using other methods.

"Our research group focuses on the development of DNA-mediated methods to pattern materials with high precision on the nanometer scale.  Towards this goal, we have examined the use of synthetic molecules to direct DNA self-assembly.  This approach has resulted in a unique range of previously unreported materials, from discrete assemblies of gold nanoparticles and transition metals with fine positioning of each component, to 3D-DNA capsules of any geometry and size, to new forms of DNA in which multiple strands (rather than two) come together.  In addition, we have shown, for the first time, the use of small molecules to switch and modify the structure of these assemblies in real-time, and to change the outcome of the self-assembly.  



The present proposal describes the development of these new biomaterials towards a number of applications. Specifically we will examine the use of 3D-DNA structures for regulation of folding and activity of encapsulated proteins, for encapsulation and selective release of drugs and for sensor design.   In addition, we will explore the construction of DNA nanotubes which transport their cargo unidirectionally and deliver it to a location.  We will expand our synthetic strategy to create 2D-extended, and 3D- assemblies of metals and nanoparticles, for applications in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.  We will also use a range of small molecules to induce dramatic structural changes in unmodified DNA strands.  Finally, we will examine the construction of fully synthetic polymers that mimic the sequence, monodispersity and specificity of DNA, and which can be used as readily made and stable alternatives to DNA.

"In recent years, Canada has invested over a hundred million dollars on proteomics research, and one significant outcome has been the discovery of a number of candidate cancer biomarkers. It has also become clear that early diagnosis of cancer will rely on the detection of not one, but a panel of many of these protein biomarkers. However, current protein detection methods are labor intensive, allow the testing of only one biomarker at a time, and lack the sensitivity and specificity to be adapted for simultaneous analysis of many targets. This proposal describes the development of a new diagnostic device that allows parallel detection of a panel of protein biomarkers with ultrahigh sensitivity and specificity. It relies on use of a new class of polymeric nanospheres containing a very large number of signal-producing molecules. Detection will be carried out using electrochemiluminescence, (ECL), in which each of these units emits light catalytically with many turnovers, thus resulting in very bright emission. These nanospheres will be integrated into an advanced microfluidic device, designed for autonomous detection of multiple proteins using very small sample volumes. New protocols for sample preparation without compromising the integrity of the proteins will also be developed. Optimization of this new platform will be carried out on mouse models, then on plasma samples from breast cancer patients. Ultimately, we will detect cancer proteins in the blood of patients to evaluate our device. Together, this combination of chemistry, nanoscience, microfluidics, and cancer research constitutes, to our knowledge, a unique union of expertise in Canada. This collaborative effort will allow, for the first time, the creation of an inexpensive microfluidic detection system that miniaturizes and arrays protein assays for diagnostic applications. Following the discovery of biomarker panels for cancer diagnosis or any other disease, this technology can be developed and used in the clinic, at the doctor's office, and ultimately at home for self-testing and diagnosis. As such, we foresee that the development of such a technology will be essential to the establishment of preventive and personalized medicine.","Microfluidic detection system for profiling multiple cancer biomarkers in serum with ultrahigh sensitivity and specificity","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Bioanalytical chemistry"

"The main role of drug metabolism is to detoxify the body from xenobiotics, rendering them more polar and thus more easily cleared. Some drugs, however, are bioactivated into reactive metabolites having the potential to covalently bind to proteins. This binding is considered to be an important cause of idiosyncratic (rare and unpredictable) drug reactions (IDRs) and, as a result, the formation of these metabolites represents a significant liability for new pharmaceutical compounds. The way in which certain drugs exhibit their toxicity can be highly variable and the exact mechanisms are still quite unclear. Designing new methods to study these

interactions would clearly benefit the field.



The proposed research involves studying the covalent binding of drugs known to form reactive metabolites. By employing a combination of high-resolution liquid chromatography and advanced mass spectrometry tools, an approach will be devised for characterizing which proteins are targeted by different reactive metabolites and where these modifications occur. Thus, more insight will be gained on the mechanisms of toxicity of these drugs. New analytical strategies will be devised for studying the mechanisms of protein modification by

reactive drug metabolites. Using a suite of drugs known to be involved in protein binding via chemically reactive metabolites, a systematic approach will be taken to identify important protein targets as well as elucidate the mechanism of binding. This research should have very important consequences for better

understanding drug metabolism and bioactivation as well as IDRs. It could also potentially identify candidate biomarkers for this type of drug toxicity. Ultimately, if we could estimate a ""danger of toxicity"" level in terms of protein adducts for certain drugs known to be susceptible to this binding, a clinical test could be envisioned in order to monitor appropriate drug dosing for an individual patient.

"Although the cochlea has been shown to be adult-like at birth, differences in auditory processing at the level of the brainstem and cortex are evident for infants compared to adults. My research program focuses on different levels of auditory processing during infancy, a period of rapid growth and neural maturation. The first set of studies will investigate infant-adult differences in hearing sensitivity related to maturation of the peripheral auditory system. There are frequency- and mode- [i.e., air- versus bone-conducted (BC) stimuli] dependent differences in hearing sensitivity between infants and adults; the mechanisms of which are not clearly understood. The first set of studies will focus specifically on the infant-adult differences in BC hearing sensitivity and the mechanisms that underlie these differences. The second set of studies will focus on cortical auditory processing and plasticity related to abnormal auditory input in early infancy. We know that pre- and post-natal auditory experience contributes to the plasticity of the auditory cortex in the developing brain. For example, exposure to our native language in infancy results in a switch from language-universal to language-specific speech categories (e.g., English-speaking babies under six months of age can discriminate English and Hindi consonants equally well but by 10 months of age are much poorer at discriminating Hindi consonants). No studies have investigated this phenomenon in infants with hearing loss who do not experience a typical amount of auditory input in the early months of life. The increasingly common clinical practice of screening all babies for hearing loss at birth and providing hearing aids and/or cochlear implants before six months of age (since 2006 in British Columbia) provides a unique opportunity to look specifically at the effects that limited auditory experience has on auditory processing capabilities and cortical plasticity. Findings from these sets of studies will help us to understand the developing auditory system from a basic level of auditory processing (sensitivity) to the processing of complex auditory stimuli (speech discrimination ability), as well as provide valuable insight into the effects of limited sensory input on the plasticity of the developing brain.","Maturation of hearing",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Sensory systems -- auditory"

"Thanks in part to my NSERC funding over the last 5 years, we validated the use of the initial lean perturbation, single step recoveries and multiple loss of balance directions in human experiments at the threshold of balance recovery. Indeed, we demonstrated that although the choice of the postural perturbation and limiting the number of steps did not affect the threshold of balance recovery, loss of balance direction did affect the threshold of balance recovery. More importantly, we demonstrated that the best clinical and experimental predictors of the ability to recover balance to avoid a fall were lower extremity muscle power and stepping velocities, respectively.

   In the next 5 years, I would like to answer some of the remaining questions regarding the age-related decline in the threshold of balance recovery and comparisons between postural perturbations, as well as determine the potential for a lower extremity muscle power intervention to improve the threshold of balance recovery. Specifically, we will: 1) establish the age at which improving the ability to recover balance becomes necessary, 2) attempt to theoretically predict whether a specific postural perturbation will result in a fall or a recovery without the need for time consuming experiments, and 3) determine the effectiveness of a lower extremity muscle power intervention in improving the ability to recover balance to avoid a fall.

   Despite the fact that falls are the leading causes of deaths and hospitalizations due to unintentional injury, only a small number of studies have attempted to take tasks related to falls to the threshold of balance recovery. I hope that my engineering approach to the threshold of balance recovery will one day lead to more efficient prevention and intervention programs for falls and thus help maintain the functional autonomy of older adults.","Biomechanics of the threshold of balance recovery","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,Biomechanics

"Attention is the process whereby individuals select objects for conscious awareness.  Understanding the basic mechanisms of attention is import for many day-to-day tasks such as driving and even searching for one's keys.  My research program is built on the hypothesis that a complete understanding of attention requires considering both the environment and the observer. Currently, much is known about how attention is influenced by basic visual properties of objects and basic variations of task demands and these factors have been well represented in current models of attention.  In contrast, relatively little is known about how attention is influenced by the characteristics of the whole embodied individual, including the physical, emotional and cognitive aspects of a person. Accordingly, the present research focuses on evaluating (1) how changes in an observer's physical state (fatigue), cognitive demands (distraction) and emotional state (mood) influence the deployment of visual attention and (2) how the meaning that an object has to an individual influences visual attention. The proposed research addresses these objectives by studying normal individuals as well as individuals with an unusual condition known as synaesthesia.  In synaesthesia, ordinary stimuli elicit extraordinary conscious experiences.  For example, people who experience a subtype of synaesthesia known as time-space synaesthesia experience units of time (e.g., months of the year) as occupying specific spatial location outside of their bodies. By studying how basic attentional processes might depend on the complex relationship between the environment and the observer, the proposed research has the potential to change the way that people conceptualize and study attention.  In addition, the proposed research on fatigue, distraction and mood will have direct bearing on countless situations of attentional orienting in everyday life (e.g., airport security screening, driving).  The findings from the proposed studies will thus provide much needed data to guide policy making in many important safety and security sectors.

"We will exploit the flexible foreign protein display capabilities and the anti-tumor properties of the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus to develop a potent therapeutic cancer vaccine, hi mouse models we will examine the value of a) direct stimulation of immune system components by antibody-based targeting of cancer antigens in concert with other displayed immune stimulants and b) targeting tumors with Caulobacters displaying tumor-directed antibodies as well as cancer antigens and immune stimulants. Therapeutic cancer vaccine approaches offer significant advantages over chemotherapy, but finding the combination of antigen, delivery vehicle and adjuvanation to break anergy has proven difficult. Treatment using bacteria is a promising approach. One (BCG) is currently used for bladder cancer. Some bacteria exhibit anti-tumor properties but are pathogenic and propagate in the host and so are poorly suited for humans. This proposal offers an alternative. Caulobacter crescentus is a non-pathogen that does not replicate in mammals. It exhibits a crystalline protein surface (S) layer that is readily adapted to display large protein segments at high surface density. It also has strong anti-tumor properties. We will combine these observations to develop a therapeutic for cancer, requiring the microbial genetics efforts of a natural science lab to produce candidate therapeutics with the formulation expertise of a Pharmacy lab to evaluate efficacy and potency. Some specific Objectives: l)We will display single chain antibodies targeting receptors of dendritic cells (e.g., DEC-205) and simultaneously display cancer antigens (e.g., MUC1 and 5T4) and immune stimulants such as GM-CSF. This is done by expression of multiple modified S-layer protein genes. We can also use Protein G (IgG binding) display to ""load"" Caulobacters with targeting monoclonals. 2) We will also target vaccine formulations directly to tumors by use of antibodies to tumor markers, expecting to stimulate infiltrating immune cells. Several model systems will be tested including Lewis Lung Carcinoma and EMT-6 Murine Mammary tumor, the best results from prophylactic mode testing will also be evaluated in therapeutic mode.","Cancer therapy employing the tumour suppressing bacterium Caulobacter crescentus","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)",CANADA,CANADA,"Life sciences research related to human health and disease"

"Most life on our planet weighs less than a few grams, experiences the world through smell and taste, and in all likelihood is unknown to science or to you. Traditional methods of identifying biodiversity and species or populations needing conservation generally use larger and better understood organisms as umbrella, or indicator, species to represent this vast bolus of biodiversity. However, such an approach does not do justice to small life, or our understanding of the processes that have formed the patterns of biodiversity within which we live today. The research in my lab uses a molecular ecological approach (using molecular genetic data to study organisms in the wild) to better understand cryptic species and fragmented spaces. Underestimating biodiversity, due to lack of morphological discontinuities or differentiation, has a dramatic and serious effect on our capacity to properly understand interactions between species. This knowledge gap will be exacerbated in a world with changing climate. Decisions regarding species membership have a cascade of consequences on our understanding of biodiversity, speciation, population connectivity and landscape fragmentation and my research program is designed to test the identification of, and concepts behind, species. I use two model systems to explore species evolution, cryptic species and population connectivity: ant species on isolated Costa Rican volcanoes and tropical and temperate parasitoid insect species involved in complex food webs. Each model system is characterised by its degree of spatial and temporal isolation and by species at the leading edge of the taxonomic impediment.  Here, an integrative approach is critical to our understanding of population connection and morphological crypsis and so I use molecular ecological tools (standardized mtDNA and nuclear markers and real time PCR reactions), morphological taxonomy and field ecology. My interdisciplinary approach tests these evolutionary and ecological processes, permits more accurate conservation and leads to a better understanding of ecology and evolution.

"Memory is not unitary but rather a multifaceted cognitive process requiring a multiplicity of brain regions and circuitry. How the brain stores new events and integrates them into the existing body of knowledge and eventually making the events accessible to influence subsequent learning and memory is the focus of the proposed research program. More specifically, an innovative method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using a combination of arterial spin labelling (ASL) and the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect, will be implemented and optimized to elucidate the neural correlates of  this complex set of cognitive processes. Using this ASL/BOLD fMRI technique, the functional and structural properties of several types of long-term memory (semantic, episodic, spatial) over different time spans (remote, recent), taking into consideration the context of the encoding (emotional, factual) and the transformation of memories that occurs over time (details, vividness), will be systematically investigated. 

This information will further our understanding of learning and memory and resolve some of the discrepancies of existing theories of memory consolidation. It is the ultimate goal of the research program to produce a new theory of memory consolidation. 

The Principal Investigator of this research program has the only fMRI laboratory in the region, along with the expertise to train highly qualified personnel (HQP). Therefore, this is a unique opportunity for HQP to be trained on a state of the art MRI scanner using new and innovative imaging procedures to study cognitive processes. It will also provide other area researchers with an opportunity to collaborate on fMRI projects and similarly, provide an ideal facility to attract and to train new HQP.

"The proposed research program is for the development of methods for the analysis of  time series, and applications to the analysis of sea level fluctuations and the concentrations of ground level pollutants. 



Global sea level is rising at the rate of about 30 cm/century, which leads to concerns about flooding of coastal regions. In several locations tidal amplitude is also increasing, which exacerbates flood risk.

Increased concentrations of air pollutants are associated with detrimental effects on human health,  ecosystem diversity, and general quality of life.

"Objectives: The research in this laboratory is concerned with understanding the relationships between sleep states and memory consolidation at the behavioural, electrophysiological and biochemical levels. 

Scientific Approach: Following learning, subjects spend more time in REM sleep. If REM sleep is prevented after learning, there is memory loss at special post training times. These are called REM Sleep Windows (RSWs) and they persist for many days after the end of training. In rats, we plan to examine the electrophysiological/neural mechanisms active during these RSWs, with focus on those RWSs that occur at least several days after all training has ended. In humans, complex procedural tasks that require learning a new cognitive strategy result in increased post training REM sleep intensities while learning of a simple motor skill task (no new cognitive strategies) results in increases in Stage 2 sleep. We plan to study the sleep EEG microarchitecture changes several days after the end of training following acquisition of complex, simple and declarative tasks. 

Novelty: That Stage 2 sleep might be involved with efficient motor skill memory while cognitive procedural memory requires REM sleep is a major conceptual change for sleep and memory specialists alike. The addition of Stage 3/4 for declarative tasks will require an even more complex and comprehensive theory.  

Significance of Work: A complete theoretical understanding of memory will only be achieved when the re-processing mechanisms of sleep are also understood. On the practical side, this information is important for all learning institutions from kindergartens to universities. The findings may also eventually aid in the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of such memory disorders as Alzheimer's.

"Significant contributions to climate science within the last two decades have firmly established tree-rings as valuable sources of proxy data for evaluating long-term climate trends at the atmosphere-ocean scale. Crucial to elucidating the inherent natural variability and answering questions about longer state-scale climate shifts in Pacific Canada is the development of supra-long paleoclimatic records built from living and subfossil trees. The project expands upon research underway at the University of Victoria Tree-Ring Laboratory and seeks to develop annually-resolved records of climatic variability from tree ring records. Known ancient forest stands will be re-sampled to deepen and extend the duration of our existing >800 year old ring-width chronologies. Focused attention will be given to sampling submerged logs, potentially preserved for thousands of years, from small lakes and ponds at montane sites in the Coast Mountains. Composite tree-ring chronologies will then be from living trees, dead standing logs and subfossil wood recovered from small lakes to produce a supra-long tree-ring chronology extending backwards thousands of years. The research allows for the development of linkages between the dendrochronological community, non-profit researchers, the forest industry and others who can use these data in the development of climate change scenarios. The research provides information fundamental to furthering our knowledge of the impact of climate changes in Pacific Canada, and assists with information crucial for developing resource management solutions that will ensure the long-term vitality of Canada's forests, forest product industries and glacier-derived water supplies.

"Three of the great challenges to humanity during the 21st century will be climate change and secure supplies of energy and food. Biochar offers solutions for all three of these. As a product of thermo-chemical biofuel production its sale strengthens the economics of biorefineries. As a form of very stable soil carbon it removes atmospheric carbon dioxide from the air and sequesters it into soil. Because it improves soil properties it increases yields of food crops (increasing food security) and of biofuel feedstock crops (increasing energy security). Between growing public concerns regarding the health and safety of food and the loss of various chemical control mechanisms for plant pathogens, particularly for greenhouse produced crops, there is an urgent need to find alternative control mechanisms for the diseases of crop plants. We propose to produce a

range of biochar types, including some with fertilizer nutrients added, and test these to determine which are most effective at improving crop growth under greenhouse conditions, and crop growth, development and yield under field conditions.

One of the most expensive, both energetically and economically, inputs into crop production is nitrogen fertilizer. Reductions in nitrogen fertilizer applications will also reduce emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, associated with N fertilizer applications. Among the potential crops utilizable for the production of cellulosic biomass for biofuel production are the fast growing grasses. The three for these probably most appropriate to Canadian conditions are Miscanthus, switchgrass and reed canarygrass. The first two can be produced in southern Canada and the latter further north.  Under Canadian conditions all three can produce yields in excess of 10 t ha-1 of processable biomass.  One way to reduce nitrogen fertilizer requirements is to rely on biological nitrogen fixation by rhizobacteria living near, on or in crop roots.  We propose to isolate free-living nitrogen-fixing rhizobacteria from stands of Miscanthus, switchgrass and reed canarygrass stands that have been grown with little or no nitrogen fertilizer for at least 15 years.  Isolated strains will be screened for ability to fix nitrogen.  We will test these strains along several well known diazotrophic rhizobacteria, on Miscanthus, switchgrass and reed canarygrass under controlled environment conditions and the best two for each crop will be identified.  These strains will be characterized and their taxonomic status determined through 16S rRNA sequence data.  The best strains will then be tested under field conditions, first on stands of switch grass already established at the Macdonald Campus agronomy research station and then on purpose grown stands of all three crops for 2 seasons.  The data will be used to determine crop productivity, nitrogen use efficiency and energy ratio.  The development of biofuel crop production systems that require little nitrogen fertilizer will improve both the economics and energetics of biofuel production.  This will facilitate the development of the biofuels energy sector, will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lead to rural renewal.

"Clavibacter  michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm) is the causal agent of bacterial wilt and canker of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), causing substantial economic losses worldwide. During the last decade research work on Cmm of tomato has largely focused on epidemiology, however, there has been little research on biological control.   There is growing interest in organic production of tomatoes and biocontrol is compatible with this approach. The goal of this proposal is to screen plant rhizospheres for bacteria antagonistic to Cmm, and to investigate their ability to protect tomato plants against Cmm. We propose to isolate root epiphytic and endophytic bacteria from rhizosphere soil and plant root samples. These isolates will then be screened for activity against Cmm. A first small effort in this regard discovered four strains that show anti-Cmm activity, however, a wide range of strains must be identified as some are certain to be found unsuitable for commercial biocontrol, due to an application and product constraints, and to regulatory restrictions; a large number at the outset is the best strategy. The active strains will be analyzed for production of anti-bacterial compounds using HPLC, GC/MS and MALDI-TOF and/or NMR spectroscopy. The anti-Cmm activity of these compounds will be assessed via the disk diffusion assay (on agar plates), and the minimum inhibitory concentration of each will be determined. We will also study the anti-Cmm activity of combinations of biocontrol bacteria and their anti-Cmm compounds. In addition, we will study the tripartite association of the biocontrol strains/anti-Cmm compounds, Cmm and the host tomato plant. Greenhouse studies will be conducted to study application sites (seed, root, foliar and various combinations of these) for biocontrol bacteria and their antibiotics in a range of combinations, for the control of Cmm. We will also determine if these bacteria/anti-Cmm compounds are able to induce disease resistance in tomato plants, thus adding to host plant defense activity against the pathogen. Finally, studies on the control of Cmm by biocontrol strains/anti-Cmm compounds will be conducted under conditions similar to commercial greenhouses.","Biocontrol of bacterial canker/wilt of tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) caused by Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis with rhizobacteria",Agriculture,CANADA,CANADA,"Plant pathology"
"Green plants are the vehicle by which virtually all energy enters the terrestrial biosphere.  Plants exude considerable quantities of recently fixed carbon into the rhizosphere, making it an energy rich niche and, as such, an arena of intense biological activity. Recent evidence suggests that rhizosphere microbial populations have sophisticated and intimate associations with plants. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) enhance the well being of plants through an array of activities including signaling compounds. The mechanism(s) by which these signals act is not well understood. However, it is increasingly clear that plants rely on PGPR for protection and enhanced growth. During the past few years we have isolated several novel signal compounds and have characterized the chemistry of one of them, thuricin 17, in detail. It is a small protein with bacteriocin activity, but also causes direct stimulation of plant growth.  The overall objective of the proposed work is to understand the mechanism by which thuricin 17 stimulates plant growth and development at the physiological and molecular levels. Proposed is research to investigate thuricin 17 effects on plants, in comparison with the previously characterized LCOs, with regard to: 1) effects on photosynthetic rates and growth, 2) CO2 compensation point effects, 3) the role of defense hormones (salicylates, jasmonates and ethylene), 4) the role of growth regulating hormones (auxins, cytokinins and gibberellins), 5) the role of pathogenisis related proteins, 6) the role of disease resistance genes, 7) changes in global gene expression.  Recent work in my laboratory has been focused on exploiting PGPR signals for plant growth promotion and has added valuable information on enhancing plant growth and development using PGPR signal technologies.  The proposed work will expand our understanding of a relationship that is coming to be seen as subtle but extremely important to the crops upon which we depend for food and, increasingly, for fuel.  Its manipulation holds great promise but we must have a much better understanding of its basic mechanisms before this can be realized.","Signals in the underground: Thuricin 17 and plant growth","Plant production and plant primary products",CANADA,CANADA,"Plant growth and development"

"Human orthosis design is generally restricted to stiff and passive mechanisms.  Given the presence of biarticular muscle-tendon complexes which are important in energy transfer and joint function coordination, improvements to these orthoses may be achieved through mechanical compliance, damping, motors and generators which mimic and augment these characteristics.  Robot surrogates can be used to provide insights into normal and pathological locomotion and can be used as robust and deterministic design and test platforms for these next generation orthoses. Advances in powered prostheses or orthoses, such as the BLEEX exoskeleton, have relied on power-hungry technologies, requiring the use of batteries or other power sources.  Additionally, generative knee orthoses  have undergone human trials and been shown to be capable of moderate conversion of human subject kinetic energy to electrical energy. However, in neither of these cases has electrical energy transfer been implemented at an inter-joint  level. 



The long term objective is the development of robotic orthoses for gait correction and augmentation which are suitable for daily use in home and out-patient contexts. In the short term, a robotic test platform will be developed which is capable of simulating healthy and pathological gait. As well,  orthosis motoring and regenerative robotic subsystems must be developed which can modulate energy usage at each joint and which can transfer energy between joints, mimicking and augmenting existing neuromechanic subsystems. By applying regenerated joint power at specific points in the gait cycle it will be possible to extend the usable life of prostheses and orthoses, making them more effective.

"The remediation of contaminated lands is a complex and highly challenging scientific problem. Contaminates in soils not only pose a direct threat to the plants, animal, and humans that are in contact with them, but also are a serious and persistent source of contamination for groundwaters. There is a real and pressing need for us to better understand the fate and persistence of contaminants in soils and groundwaters. One of the complicating issues and limitations to our ability to predict the behavior of soil contaminants is that the rate water flows through the soil and the amount of water stored in the soil can change over time due to the presence of the contaminants themselves and their effects on soil properties. This research will advance our knowledge of those relationships and provide the foundation to better predict the risks and threats associated with our soil and groundwater resources. This research will be conducted as a combination of systematic highly instrumented laboratory experiments targeting the linkage and feedback between contaminants and water flow in soils and the development of new mathematical expressions and models to better predict the behaviors. Ultimately this research will lay the foundation for improved soil remediation practices and potentially new remediation methods to reclaim contaminated lands and protect groundwater resources. The eight students (undergraduates, Master's, and PhD) trained in this research program will have advanced knowledge of soil and groundwater contamination and will find employment in Canada's environmental sector which has demands for highly qualified personnel which substantially exceed the supply.

"For over two decades, mass spectrometry (MS) has proven to be particularly well suited to analyze proteins. Initial efforts in this field successfully identified dozens of proteins in a single experiment and it is now possible to identify thousands of proteins from complicated biological extracts with relative ease. MS-based protein characterization (proteomics) studies have become increasingly prevalent and attention has begun to shift from merely identifying the presence of proteins in a given sample to characterizing the dynamics of proteins in the context of a changing biological system. Although a number of strategies to quantify protein dynamics using MS are available, many are cost prohibitive or negatively affect the analytical sensitivity. Our ongoing research program will strive to develop technology and strategies to improve the reproducibility and overall quality of quantitative proteomic analyses; this work will concurrently develop improved protein identification methods as well. To begin, we will investigate the dynamics of protein phosphorylation, an important protein modification that is employed by cells to control protein function. To date, relatively few predicted phosphorylation sites have been experimentally confirmed despite the fact that many different disease states are associated with faulty phosphorylation mechanics. Current methods to chemically modify and enrich phosphorylated peptides involve multiple transfer steps to containers with relatively large volumes, resulting in sample loss and depletion of analytical sensitivity. To overcome this, microliter-scale columns packed with peptide-binding resin will be used to concentrate and process complicated biological samples so that phosphorylated peptides may be isolated with minimal transfer steps and user intervention. Furthermore, the ability to chemically modify peptides in distinct ways will be available which will allow peptide/phosphopeptide concentration dynamics to be measured over the course of an external stimulus (e.g. determining the proteomic response of cells exposed to a drug). The application of this technology to probe specific biological questions will be carried out in parallel with its development.","Developing new technology and novel strategies to enhance the quality of quantitative proteomic analyses","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Bioanalytical chemistry"

"About 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil equivalent is currently produced from the bitumen extracted from Canadas oilsands and this is expected to reach 3 million bpd by 2020.  The bitumen can be upgraded by carbon rejection (coking) or by hydrogen addition (hydroconversion) processes.  Coking produces large quantities of coke that must be stockpiled whereas hydroconversion using supported catalysts that rapidly deactivate, results in high catalyst costs.  Improved upgrading technologies are needed to allow for the sustainable growth in the development of oil sands, to improve process efficiency and to reduce the environmental impact of oil sands processing.



One approach to improved upgrading is by hydroconversion in a slurry phase reactor using dispersed catalysts.  This approach avoids catalyst deactivation and operates at high conversion(> 80%) with very low coke yield (<1%). However, this technology has not been commercialized because catalyst cost dictates that catalyst recycle and/or regeneration is needed, especially if Mo catalysts are used.  Our results from a recently completed 2-year NSERC-CRD project demonstrated that both Mo-octanoate and Mo-micelle catalysts had high residue conversions(>80%) with low coke yield (<3%). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Mo catalyst-coke recovered after reaction could be recycled, although as the Mo content in the recycled coke decreased, so did the performance of the catalyst.  We propose to continue this work by examining alternative thermal and chemical treatments of the catalyst-coke such that a simple regeneration method can be used to extend the life of the recycled catalyst.  Key fundamental questions will be investigated in regards to the mechanism by which the Mo catalyst and the Ni, V and coke interact.  Although the Mo can be recovered from the catalyst-coke by combustion and extraction of the resulting ash, a simpler approach to re-activate the Mo is needed.

"Natural gas (predominantly methane, CH4) is an abundant, cleaner-burning fuel than gasoline, particularly when combined with hydrogen (H2). Westport Innovations Inc. of Vancouver, BC is a world-leading company that provides technology to transform diesel engines to operate on natural gas, biogas, propane, and hydrogen, with a focus on medium and heavy duty vehicles such as transit buses, delivery vehicles, refuse collection trucks, and large highway trucks. A significant impediment to the widespread implementation of natural gas in combustion engines is that unburned CH4 expelled in the exhaust is a significant greenhouse gas with a potency more than ~25 times that of carbon dioxide. Traditional catalytic converters, optimized for reducing oxides of nitrogen (NOx), unburned hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide, are not efficient at methane

oxidation, especially at the low to moderate exhaust gas temperatures (150 to 500 ï¿½C) of diesel-cycle engines. In order to reduce the CH4 content in the exhausts from these vehicles, it is crucial to develop new catalysts that can operate at <500 C and efficiently oxidize methane. Our aim is to develop new materials for low-temperature CH4 oxidation, and to investigate their ability to function as methane oxidation catalysts. Three new classes of materials will be developed: (a) highly porous metal oxides, (b) monodisperse platinum group metal (PGM) nanoparticles and (c) hybrid PGM/metal oxide nanoparticles. The most promising of the new materials will be identified through laboratory-scale reaction tests that simulate exhaust gas conditions. The best catalysts will be incorporated into the monolith of a prototype catalytic converter and evaluated using

an engine dynamometer that provides the operating conditions relevant for proper assessment of automobile emission control devices. This proposal targets new emission reduction technologies and we anticipate that in the course of this project, new materials will be identified and tested for the purpose of low-temperature methane catalysis.","Novel Catalysts for Low Temperature Methane Oxidation","Energy storage and conversion",CANADA,CANADA,"Fuel and energy technology (economic geology, use 4003)"
"Gas-to-liquid (GTL) technology refers to catalytic processes that convert CO, CO2 and H2 (syngas) to liquid fuels.  GTL technologies are expected to play an important role in providing the clean fuels needed to reduce the environmental impact of fossil fuels. Although oxygenated fuels are important clean fuels, selective synthesis of ethanol from syngas is very difficult. Syngas can be produced by reforming various carbon sources and reforming is also used in hydrogen production, but large amounts of CO2 are produced as a byproduct. Thermocatalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons offers an alternative route to hydrogen with the potential to generate 5 times less CO2 per unit of H2 produced.

   The first part of the research proposed herein is aimed at promoting selective ethanol synthesis from syngas. We will use molecular simulation to model C-C bond formation on catalysts with basic promoters and develop microkinetic models of the reactions. The modeling results will be used to guide development of new catalyst formulations. In a second approach, we will focus on the mechanism of the first C-C coupling reaction, that is catalysed by a strong base. Hence, we will investigate strong basic catalysts (alkali promoted MgO and alkali promoted L-type zeolite) in combination with hydrogenating metals (Cu or Co), for high ethanol selectivity.

    Thermocatalytic decomposition (TD) of hydrocarbons to carbon and H2 is one approach to COx-free hydrogen that is limited by thermodynamics in the case of CH4. In the second part of the research we will examine liquid hydrocarbons (hexane) for TD since the equilibrium constant for the decomposition of hexane is orders of magnitude greater than that of CH4, separation of H2 from any un-reacted feed is simple (by condensation) and transportation of liquid fuels is well established so that use of this reaction in mobile fuel-cell applications becomes feasible.  The study will focus on the effects of catalysts and reaction conditions on the kinetics of TD and the selectivity for H2 generation.

"There are many different approaches to achieving the 3R's of software product development - the right product at the right price and at the right time. Proponents of Agile Methodologies advocate for light-weight development processes that combine increased customer involvement with early and repeated testing. It has been suggested that an Agile highly test-oriented design process would be highly appropriate for embedded world development. However,  reports demonstrating transfer from the business world into this new environment have been slow in coming. To improve the acceptance of embedded Agile concepts we have  (1) proposed and applied an eXtreme Programming Inspired (XPI) embedded life-cycle and (2) successfully prototyped embedded test driven processes supported through an Embedded-Unit test framework across a range of embedded system architectures in an industrial environment.  From discussions with our industrial and research collaborators, a repeated theme was to extend our original XPI ideas to provide additional processes and tools to support embedded development for telecommunication, medical, video and other products; in particular assistance in developing new and (reliably) integrate existing complex DSP algorithms that interact with both the user and each other. This proposal, collaboratively funded through NSERC, Analog Devices Inc and a number of Calgary companies (Ivoxx, SMART Technologies and CDL Systems), plans to overcome these limitations with extensions to our Embedded Unit test framework to pro-actively identify defects using a test driven development process.

"Our research currently encompasses the characterization of systems in two diverse areas: telecommunications and imaging. Both areas require (A) fundamental research to discover new algorithms, (B) the development of appropriate software engineering processes to move those new algorithms from a fault-tolerant research environment onto a defect free, embedded system based product, and (C) actual implementation of the embedded product.  During a recent NSERC CRD grant (2004 - 2007) with our industrial partner Analog Devices (Canada and US), we developed testing frameworks oriented towards embedded digital signal processing (DSP) platform development. We propose to extend our framework to support the movement of DSP intensive algorithms onto inexpensive, high-speed, client-side, mobile devices based around FPGAs combined with low-cost hypermedia-capable processors.  Another of our collaborations is associated with image processing related to edge retention (detection) in the presence of noise, particularly within the context of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We have theoretically demonstrated a combined spatial and scale-space approach for a spatially adaptive wavelet-based noise filtering algorithm. We intend to investigate how this multi-space approach can be enhanced by incorporating a new ultra-high speed S-transform (UHS S-transform) algorithm recently patented by members of our group. We propose to validate these extensions through a comparison with existing 'gold-standard' anisotropic filtering techniques prior to moving the algorithms, through our embedded-system testing framework, onto embedded system platforms. This grant also proposes a preliminary, but detailed, study of this new S-transform implementation. It is self-evident that there will be different compromises necessary to get the UHS S-transform to operate within (i) the practical constraints of DSP hyper-media capable, but low-cost, processors used within hand-held consumer products e.g. fMRI and ECG analysis; and (ii) implementing the algorithm on VLIW processors specifically designed to work within a multi-cluster environment.","An investigation of new DSP algoithms for biomedical engineering and software defined radio; and processes for defect-free implementation on a variety of processor architectures","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Digital signal processing"

"My NSERC Program investigates the biochemical and genetic bases of nonself recognition in fungi, a process that is analogous to graft rejection in animals and plants. Similar to ""more complex organisms"", fungi use nonself recognition systems to slow or prevent disease transmission (and thus thwart biological control programs), and to modulate intra- and interspecies interactions, including interactions involved in the maintenance of territory. At the biochemical level, our research will investigate how nonself recognition proteins interact to trigger a phenomenon called Programmed Cell Death (PCD). PCD is one way that organisms limit their own proliferation, and thus understanding this process has applications in diverse areas such as in developing control strategies for pathogens of plants and animals. We have evidence that nonself recognition proteins trigger PCD by sticking together to form a toxic complex, and that protein degradation can rid the cell of such complexes. Similar protein degradation processes are central to diseases associated with prion-like elements such as Huntington's  and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE, ""Mad Cow Disease""). At the genetic level we will clone and characterize additional nonself recognition genes to gain an understanding of the diversity of factors that fungi use for nonself recognition. Finally, we will determine how naturally occurring viruses manipulate nonself recognition systems to gain access to their fungal host. Our exploration of the interaction between viruses and incompatibility factors is relevant to diverse areas of host - parasite interactions and may lead to improved biological control strategies for plant pathogens. Overall, the proposed research into nonself recognition will significantly enhance our understanding of this basic biological phenomenon and will provide advanced training to students in a variety of highly desirable fields such as genetics, microbiology and biochemistry.

Summary for public release

Phytoplankton are microscopic algae that produce much of the world's oxygen and absorb a large fraction of the carbon dioxide taken out of the atmosphere each year by plants. They form the base of the food web in open waters. In lakes, they can also harm water quality if they become very prolific or if harmful and/or toxic species proliferate. Because of this it is important to have the best possible understanding of the environmental factors that control the amounts and types of phytoplankton that grow in lakes. For large lakes this is a particular challenge because traditional methods are too labour intensive to allow good coverage. The work proposed here focuses on new techniques that give us important answers about how light, nutrients, and terrestrial runoff influence phytoplankton in the Great Lakes. It will make use of recent investments in new types of equipment for measuring photosynthetic properties of populations, size and health of individual cells and organisms, and origins of organic material and energy in aquatic communities. It will train students in advanced techniques that are needed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of science-based environmental regulation and management. The research answers will help us better plan for and understand the implications of climate fluctuations, stratospheric ozone depletion, nutrient pollution and human alteration of drainage basins.","Primary production processes in the Laurentian great lakes",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Aquatic ecology and limnology"
"Much of this applicant's research career has been concerned with the science and practice of solidification i.e. how to help the user to make better castings.  The metal used for cast products is usually an alloy consisting of one element in abundance (the solvent) and smaller percentages of a number of other elements (solutes).  When the liquid metal begins to solidify, the solutes tend to become localised in small regions of the casting and help to produce the 'microstructure' of the cast metal, important in determining the as-cast properties.  Empirical knowledge is no longer sufficient to meet the current demand for a higher quality in surface finish and/or stronger products and so this has resulted in the casting process being 'numerically modeled', i.e. casting engineers develop a detailed understanding of the casting process itself and how small changes in (say) the temperature of the liquid metal when poured into the mold will affect the final microstructure and hence the final properties of the cast material.  The development of a custom-built model is usually an imperative component of the design and operation of the larger scale industrial casting process if it is to be economically competitive with others.  However, any computer model will only be as good as the accuracy of the physical and chemical data used by the modelers.  Since the metal to be cast contains solute and that solute moves about - 'diffuses' - during the freezing of the alloy, it is imperative that accurate diffusion rates for the principal solutes be available.  Since much of the published data in this area is not particularly accurate, the major aim of this proposal is to seek a better understanding of how such diffusion rates change with temperature. With respect to the training of HQP, the project involves the development of computational skills and precision with physical measurements - both of great importance in the Canadian workplace.

"The main objective of my research program is to describe and understand the manner in which HIV-positive patients adhere to their prescribed treatment regimens. This is done by development and analysis of mathematical models and through data-model fitting.



Adherence to HIV medication has been described as the most urgent problem in medical research today. Very little theoretical work has been done to understand these complex patterns of human behaviour, of doctor-prescribed treatment breaks, of the interaction of side-effects upon a patient's decision to pause treatment. This involves both immunological (within-host) and epidemiological (population-wide) models in order to determine how adherence facilitates the emergence of drug resistance.



The models can also be used to determine the best time to take a break from therapy and how long such a break should be. They will also determine the best time to change treatment regimes.



The analysis is primarily focussed on control strategies, including treatment, vaccines, microbicides and boosting of the immune system, as well as the nature of what happens when such control strategies fail.

"My research aims to increase our ability to manage forest insects through improved understanding of factors that affect natural enemies regulating forest-feeding insects.  Specifically, I explore questions related to population mortality and community diversity of insect natural enemies, with focus on understanding and manipulating native parasitoids and predators.  Recent introductions into Canada of several major forest insects (emerald ash borer, Asian long-horned beetle, Sirex woodwasps) enables us to compare the complexes of native and exotic natural enemies, and to explore mechanisms by which these communities affect host mortality and pest invasion.  My current work tests hypotheses about how exotic species and communities displace native ones in order to better understand invasion processes in the forest.  In this proposal, I test  the enemy release hypothesis (ERH), more specifically, the enemy reduction in nonindigenous species hypothesis (ENRS).  I ask the questions, does ENRS explain patterns of enemy attack and host productivity on indigenous (Ips) and exotic (Tomicus) bark beetles, or is there evidence for biotic resistance (BR).  The eastern pine engraver beetle (I. pini) is native to NA, while T. piniperda (another phloem-feeding scolytid) was introduced from Europe during the 1990's. The latter has become established; both are sympatric and feed on the same native (P. strobus, P. resinosa, P. banksiana) and exotic (P. sylvestris) pines in stands across southern Ontario.  Using this exotic/indigenous bark beetle system, I will test ERNS with respect to levels of predation, parasitism, and community diversity of enemies and associates on these two beetles.  I predict that enemies of the indigenous beetle will be more diverse and occur at greater densities than those of the nonindigenous Tomicus.  Biogeographic and ontongenic data will be derived across a gradient of beetle densities to quantify the degree to which enemies are present, and account for beetle mortality and productivity. These results will add to our current understanding of invasion dynamics, and at the applied level, help to direct management strategies for invasive alien forest insect species.

"The objective of the proposed research program is to improve the quality of scientific computation (SC) software.  Although many high quality algorithms have been implemented, especially with respect to the qualities of correctness, reliability and performance, there are other qualities, such as usability, maintainability, verifiability, productivity, reusability and portability that are often neglected.  To address these quality concerns, the proposed approach is to adapt software engineering (SE) methodologies that have been successfully applied for other types of software.  One new idea that can be adapted from SE is the development of SC code as a program family.  In this approach similar software products are developed together, with the common parts reused and the variable features identified and systematically handled.  This research has the potential to significantly improve SC code with respect to reusability because the common code only has to be implemented once.  Testing is another area of SE practise that will be adapted with the goal of improving the quality of SC software.  The testing research will be challenging because most testing methodologies assume that for each set of test inputs an expected output can be identified, but this is often not the case for SC software.  This challenge will be addressed through techniques of parallel testing with independent algorithms, comparison to closed-form solutions, the use of interval and infinite precision arithmetic, a posteriori error estimation and systematic identification and documentation of known characteristics of the solution.

"The ways in which we interact with the world, and even the ways in which we see the world, depend largely on how we focus our attention.  For example, when attention is distracted, people often fail to notice even salient objects or events that appear right before their eyes.  Many studies have investigated the ways in which attention is deployed and how it facilitates cognitive processing of abstract shapes and symbols.  Such stimuli have been used because they are convenient and easy to study. However, humans live in a world laden with emotional meaning; the traditional use of meaningless stimuli (e.g., patterns and colors) does not reflect this fact and thus can tell us little about how people use emotional information to guide their attention to potentially important aspects of their environments.  

     

Dr. Stephen Smith and his colleagues have initiated a series of studies to identify how emotion influences our attention.  Using a combination of laboratory tests and brain-imaging studies, Dr. Smith is examining (1) what types of stimuli capture and hold attention, (2) what cognitive processes are related to this emotional modulation of attention, and (3) what brain areas are involved in these processes.  A critical component of this research is the fact that rather than simply focusing on innately emotional stimuli such as faces, the research will examine the degree to which learned emotional associations affect our ability to encode information.  Given that many of our emotional experience are learned associations between a stimulus (e.g., a car) and an emotional outcome (e.g., an accident), understanding how these associations influence attention is very important.  The results will provide new insight into emotion-attention interactions, and will be of interest both to cognitive-neuroscience researchers and to more applied clinical practitioners.

"We will develop new computational tools for the prediction of the thermochemical properties of pure fluids and mixtures, based on molecular-level models of matter. The research involves developing novel computer simulation algorithms based on a general description of molecular-level behaviour, which may be used as tools for guiding accurate engineering predictions and the design of processes involving complex chemical systems. The methods may be used either directly or to generate pseudo-experimental data that may be fitted to macroscopic thermodynamic models for use in chemical process simulators such as AspenPlus, HySys, OLI, and others.  One sub-project will develop accurate approaches for making predictions related to a general type of energy-conserving process; this has applications ranging from the design of environmentally benign refrigerants to the design of combustion units and explosive devices. The other sub-project deals with computer simulation approaches for predicting the solubility and thermodynamic properties of electrolytes in aqueous and other media and for extending the approaches to molecularly confined environments.

"There is deep scientific concern and growing public awareness of human impacts on ecosystem health.  Environmental contamination poses threats, perceived and real, to vertebrates inhabiting disturbed areas, with wild birds making up appealing, visible components of the ecosystem. Before they can fly, young birds reflect the quality of air and food in their immediate surroundings, and, as neonates, they are particularly sensitive to food- and air- borne contaminants. A valuable method that scientists have to study the subtle health effects of contaminant exposure is through testing the immune system which is essential for survival in the wild. Many scientists have shown that environmental pollutants do have negative effects on the immune system.  This finding has been assumed to mean that those animals are more vulnerable to infectious diseases. However, there are several factors that have not been thoroughly addressed; 1) how to ensure that the immune function tests, mainly developed in domestic poultry, are effective in the wild species on which they are used, and 2) how these mmunological tests relates to disease. 

    )	In spite of the popular use of immunological testing in wild birds, the relationship between their responses and actual disease resistance has never been investigated.  Using the novel tests of cell mediated, humoral, and innate immunity that I have validated in wild bird species over the past several years, I will test the true impact of contaminant-induced compromise of the immune system on disease resistance in birds. This work will be accomplished using avian models in laboratory settings. Through examination of the immune system in young birds, the hypothesis I will test is that exposure to environmental contaminants will result in increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. The outcome of my proposed research will provide the essential information to assure all those researchers using tests of immunotoxicology, that there is a causal link with disease susceptibility justifying the use of these tests.  Equally importantly, this work will lead to increased insight into the well being of wildlife populations.

"Chronic arsenic toxicity (arsenicosis) is a major human health problem in extensive areas of the world, including Bangladesh and the Gangetic plains of South Asia. There is considerable epidemiological evidence that arsenicosis is exacerbated by deficiencies of selenium (Se) and folate in human diets.

Selenium, an essential trace element in our diets, is deficient in soils over large areas of the world. Selenium levels in humans are determined by the bioavailable Se content of the plants in their diet. Split lentil, a quick cooking pulse, is an important component in the daily diet of most families in the arsenic-affected areas of South Asia. Saskatchewan has good soil Se in most crop production areas. Lentils are known to take up this nutrient in adequate, but not toxic, amounts as 'Se accumulator1 plants do.

Current research also demonstrates that folate supplementation of diets of arsenic exposed people results in decreased blood arsenic levels and increased urinary output of arsenic metabolites. In studies with laboratory mammals, folic acid supplementation can reduce signs of arsenic toxicity.

In this research we propose to take advantage of the biochemically antagonistic relationship between selenium and arsenic to counteract arsenic toxicity in animals. We will specifically examine the effects of dietary supplementation with Se and folate, on clinical symptoms of arsenic toxicity in laboratory rats. Next, we plan to identify naturally folate rich, Saskatchewan lentil varieties with higher Se content, and establish links between the high Se lentil, and health benefits in chronic arsenic poisoning.

"Arctic regions have been repeatedly identified as bellwethers for the study of global environmental change. However, due to the lack of long-term data, it is impossible to determine the timing and magnitude of many ecosystem changes, and to test hypotheses, define natural variability, and evaluate models. Consequently, indirect proxy methods, such as using information preserved in lake sediments (i.e. paleolimnology) must be used to address many scientifically and socially-relevant questions. During my 26 year research program in the Arctic, which dovetails with our ongoing paleolimnological work, we have recorded marked limnological changes as high Arctic ponds become less ice-covered and shallower with warming until many of the smaller sites finally dried up totally in July 2006.  We will study how these unprecedented ecological changes are affecting Arctic ecosystems, as well as comparable paleolimnological and ecological changes in other Arctic regions.  A second new research area will focus our approaches on subarctic peatland profiles, which potentially offer higher temporal resolution of environmental change than Arctic lake sediments, and may be more closely linked to precipitation and evaporation ratios. Our main focus will be a transect of peat and permafrost cores from the Hudson Bay Lowlands region, which is a region that is critically important for our understanding of climatic and environmental change.  A parallel paleolimnological study of 15 lakes, working in collaboration with process-based scientists, will complement this boreal to subarctic transect, and determine how climate-related changes in ice cover and/or thermal stratification patterns are affecting lakes in these poorly studied regions, bordering on temperate and sub-arctic ecosystems. Finally, we will develop and apply new paleolimnological methods (based largely on invertebrate indicators) to track a new and previously under-recognized environmental problem affecting softwater boreal lakes around the world:  the decline in lakewater calcium concentrations.

"Information retrieval (IR) has become an important part of life with people regularly using IR systems to search the web, their email, and other collections of documents.  Even with the success of commercial web search companies, people still fail to find the information that they need to answer their questions.  We propose to better utilize the power of user interaction to improve the quality of IR systems.  It is well-known that user interaction has the potential to significantly improve retrieval quality, but many user interaction mechanisms fail to be adopted by either commercial search providers or by the users of search systems.  To create interaction mechanisms that are both powerful and adopted, we propose to create a collection of simple mechanisms that can be easily added to existing search systems.  These simple interaction mechanisms, when taken as a whole, should speed the rate at which users can find answers to their questions.  The proposed research program will build on our past work where we have shown that a widely adopted, simple interaction mechanism, ""find-similar"", has the potential to boost retrieval quality by over 20% compared to a state-of-the-art non-interactive retrieval system.  We first plan to validate via user studies our earlier simulation based results for the find-similar interaction mechanism.  Next we intend to develop new interaction mechanisms that will speed the rate that users can answer complex questions with an IR system.    Finally, we will create new interactive IR evaluation techniques by further merging automated usability testing methods (e.g. user simulations) with traditional IR evaluation methods.  The research program will follow a cycle of formative design of interaction mechanisms followed by summative user testing.  Each part of the cycle will feedback into the other.  Applying this process to the problem of complex question answering, we expect to achieve a 50% or greater improvement over non-interactive retrieval.","Utilizing interaction to improve information retrieval","Information systems and technology",CANADA,CANADA,"Information systems design"
"The continued integration of microelectronics with physical systems such as optics, micro-mechanical devices (MEMS), and sensors has produced a need for more sophisticated Computer Aided Design (CAD) and simulation software. Examples of highly integrated systems include: integrated optics; micro-machined mechanical devices integrated with CMOS modules; and integrated sensors consisting of chemical/mechanical/biological sensors. This work addresses two primary challenges for CAD that arise for such systems: One is the need for accurate and fast simulation of tightly coupled systems spanning multiple energy domains. The second is the need for a high degree of system optimization to lower costs in very competitive markets. Commonly, the design of such complex systems is achieved by the partitioning of the system into blocks. These blocks divide the complex system into simpler pieces with well defined interactions so that each piece can be designed and modeled separately. However such approaches have significant limitations.



In this grant the applicant intends to pursue the development of a single software infrastructure which will allow for the self-consistent simulation of highly integrated systems. These systems will include electronic circuits, optical systems, thermal coupling, and electromagnetic and mechanical effects.   The result of this work will be a novel software tool with radically new simulation capabilities. As this work progresses it is intended that an ongoing cooperation with the Canadian company Optiwave System Inc. (Ottawa) will lead to commercialization of aspects of this work.

real-time interactive physics-based computer music instruments, including 

continued development of measurement techniques for obtaining musical 

instrument transfer functions, improved sound synthesis quality, extending 

the variety of sounds of which instrument models are capable (by 

""generalizing"" synthesis models), and improving playability, involving 

primarily the estimation and mapping of model parameters.



A relatively inexpensive and robust measuring technique is under

development, allowing for accurate estimation of reflection functions

from wind instrument bores.  These functions may be incorporated into

parametric synthesis models, either in the context of a classic waveguide 

model, or in the construction of a parametric impulse response to be 

used in our currently in-progress synthesis technique dubbed, 

""Convolutional Waveguide Synthesis"".  This serves both to improve the 

quality of the sound synthesis, but also to provide an accurate test signal 

for observing parameters and inferring actual values of the model 

parameters.  It can also serve to create hybrid models no longer 

scientifically constrained, though still physically based, where physical 

attributes required for the production of sound (i.e. to achieve oscillation) 

are no longer solely responsible for the sound's quality.

"I conduct research into methods (algorithms) for processing sequences of letters called strings -- objects so simple that there seems to be no need of ""algorithms""!  But, first of all, strings are ubiquitous: a text file, a computer program (millions of letters), a book (in English or Chinese), the human genome (3 billion letters), one day's e-mail traffic (trillions of letters).  Secondly, efficient processing of strings is essential: repeating substrings in a genome may be of great biological/genetic significance, phrases may need to be identified/changed in a text file or computer program, books may need to be searched for significant phrases, e-mail traffic may need to be searched for undesirable messages (spam).



For 18 years I have been designing such algorithms.  Current and future research focusses on three main areas:



(1) Using recent insights into the nature of ""regularities"" in strings, I seek new methods to efficiently compute repeating substrings -- with applications particularly to computational biology, data mining and data compression.  Essentially I seek a more precise mathematical understanding of periodicity in strings.



(2) The ""suffix array"" is a specialized data structure used to improve the efficiency of string algorithms.  I seek new efficient algorithms that use suffix arrays, again with frequent application to computational biology and many other areas.



(3) In many problems that arise in practice, it may be necessary to process strings that contain ""indeterminate"" (not fully defined) entries.  I seek faster more effective algorithms for doing pattern-matching and other operations on these indeterminate strings.

"The ability to predict future climate and forecast tomorrow's weather has important implications for Canadians. While the atmosphere plays a crucial role in these simulations, models representing the ocean and land surfaces greatly influence exchanges of heat and moisture.  These surfaces are ""boundaries"" for the atmosphere and have received much attention lately to help improve weather prediction and climate simulations.  Over land surfaces, efforts focused first on representing major elements of the climate system where data was available to build and test the models.  As such, these land surface schemes provide good representation of many landforms under normal conditions.  Work is continuing with these models to extend and test their abilities to cope with more hostile environments such as Canadian's far north and during periods of extreme weather such as drought.



To handle extreme conditions, it is important to focus on land surface boundaries.  Earlier work on river and lake lateral boundaries will soon assist in flood prediction.  Lower boundaries, however, have received far less attention.  At the lower bound of the land surface, groundwater and permafrost exists and these take on greater importance during extremes.  Groundwater reserves provide a much needed water supply during drought.  The sustainability of these supplies during extended drought and their role in drought evolution is unknown.  Similarly, permafrost extent under climate warming is also very uncertain.  Both streamflow generation and soil strength for civil infrastructure depend on how permafrost will evolve under climate warming.  This grant will build on-going research in drought and cold regions hydrology to: i) simulate groundwater over a large prairie areas influenced by drought and to ii) generate downscaled climate over research basins in Canadian cold regions to evaluate climate impacts.  This focus on improved representation of boundaries for land surface schemes will add to Canada's research capacity in climate and weather prediction under conditions of extreme.

"Marine biodiversity has emerged as a hot topic in ecology over the last five years, in part because of concern over biodiversity loss and deterioration of ocean function. Nonetheless, there is currently little scientific basis for marine conservation in cold ocean environments and decisions regarding prioritization are typically made based on static measures rather than on processes. Thus, there is often greater concern for charismatic or economically valuable species and habitats rather then establishing an understanding of processes that underlie persistence of populations, communities, and habitats while developing objective predictive tools that can assist scientists and managers in protecting and managing marine biodiversity. I propose to utilize new technologies - specifically ocean observatories and manipulative laboratory and field experiments - to improve our understanding of key sources of new recruits, the role of habitats needed for some species to flourish, and to establish approaches that will allow us to extrapolate from individual measurements to broader understanding of factors that contribute to health of seafloor environments. Experimental work in field and laboratory settings will examine larval transport and settlement processes and how these variables contribute to population structure and patterns of biodiversity, why some environments are hotspots of biodiversity where others are not, and how living organisms interact with their environment to maintain ocean health and production.

     Oceans are directly relevant to the economic and social well-being of Canadians on all three of Canada's coasts and are indirectly critical to all Canadians (e.g., climate regulation, food supply). Improved understanding of marine ecosystems in this region will lead to better management and predictive ability, and provide a more comprehensive perspective on the critical biodiversity resource that resides on the marine seafloor.","A scientific basis for conservation of marine biodiversity","Oceans, seas and estuaries",CANADA,CANADA,"Evolution and ecology"

"Take a quick look around you. Most of the time, our visual world contains people and/or objects of assorted shapes, sizes, and colours. Much, if not most, of this visual information is completely irrelevant for current behavioural goals such as reading this summary. So how does the brain enhance currently relevant information while keeping the ""extra"" information, including the information we've already processed, from interfering with our tasks?



My research attempts to answers both questions by looking for the secrets of success in two everyday tasks that we are constantly performing - search and reading. Previous research demonstrated that people search efficiently by ""tagging"" inspected locations as searched, which prevents another search of the same area again and effectively orients them to uninspected areas. My research has shown that number of locations that can be tagged at any one time is four or five. I have also shown that the tags last longer when more attention is devoted to the search. One of my current research questions regards the age at which this tagging begins to help our searches and when it becomes most efficient. A second question is how our eye movements affect both the tagging and the duration of the tags when multiple locations are searched. My second area of research involves understanding why some people have reading problems. One idea is that the difficulty arises because information on their left is not processed as efficiently or effectively as information on the right. This would severely comprise their reading ability given that English and many other languages are read from left to right. My research will examine how a deficit in processing across time and space contributes to reading difficulties.



Conducting research on efficient (successful search) and inefficient (reading difficulty) can provide insight into success and failure in other everyday activites.

"This project will involve the collaboration between two universities in Canada (Waterloo and McGill), one university in Brazil (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, UFRGS), and the leading polyolefin characterization company Polymer Char (Valencia, Spain) to design new polyolefins using metallocene catalysts supported on novel inorganic carriers. The project is synergistic because each researcher will bring a different expertise to the research team; it is also integrated because our ultimate objective, the synthesis of polyolefins with enhanced properties, can only be obtained through the integration of four fields of knowledge: catalyst synthesis and supporting, catalysts characterization, polymerization engineering, and polyolefin characterization



Polyolefins are the most important large-volume plastics today and can be found in several different applications, ranging from plastic bags, household items and appliances, automotive parts and medical applications. In addition to their relatively low cost, their impact in the environment is relatively low, since they are composed of only carbon and hydrogen atoms, their production processes do not involve the use of hazardous solvents (in fact, several process do not use solvent at all), and they are readily recyclable and reused. Polyolefins can also be made with monomers obtained from renewable sources, such as sugar-cane. Because of these advantages, there is a current push towards the production of polyolefins with improved properties to compete with more expensive differentiated-commodity and specialty polymers, an effort in which this project intends to embark. Canada is a producer (Nova Chemicals, Imperial Oil, and Dow Chemical) and a main user of polyolefins and will certainly benefit from progress in this area of research.

"It is impossible to visualize modern life without the use of polymers. Polymers are usually known as plastics or rubbers. They are used in a variety of applications such as domestic appliances, plastic bags, automobile parts and tires, hoses, adhesives, paints and varnishes. 



Polymer molecules are very long because they are formed by connecting hundreds to thousands of small molecules called monomers. Depending on the type of monomer and on the way they are connected to form the polymer molecule, products with different properties are obtained. One of the challenges of polymer science and engineering is to discover ways of producing polymers with better properties while still keeping production costs low and minimizing the impact of plastics in the environment. 



The main objective of this project is to produce polymers with new molecular structures based on relatively simple monomers such as ethylene and propylene. Conventional polyethylene and polypropylene (their equivalent polymers) are inexpensive and used for bulk applications such a grocery bags and plastic cups, for instance. They are easy to recycle and do not contain harmful components. Our intention in this project is to alter the way these polymers are made so that they can be used in much more sophisticated applications that currently require more expensive polymers, but still retaining their relatively low costs. If successful, these new polymers could bring a two-fold benefit to society: cost reduction for several consumer goods and a wider use of easily-recyclable polyolefins.

"Mixed-signal approach to integrated circuit (IC) design, where digital and analog logic share the same semiconductor die and seamlessly work together, has been employed by both industry and academia for a number of years now.



In recent years, however, the main focus of mixed-signal IC research and development has shifted towards architectures and systems inspired by biological organisms and biomedical applications, where the traditional telecommunication circuitry, which is providing data-link path, now represents minority within the overall system. Moreover, either internal IC functions are being implemented and optimized so that operations of biological organisms are being mimicked, or the overall IC specifications are targeted for applications related to, for example, medical implants and biomedical research. Some of IC specifications which are nowadays assumed, include ultra-low-power of operation, small physical dimensions and self-power capability, for example by means of power scavenging or wireless power transfer. 



Research being proposed deals specifically with mixed-signal integrated circuit theory, design and implementation issues which are overlapping with other disciplines such as biomedical engineering, physics, robotics, earth and space sciences. Emerging fields such as neuroprosthetic and brain-computer interface (BCI), bionics and genetic algorithms, with support of material sciences, such as nanotechnology, open a large number of possibilities for interdisciplinary research and further advances of science. It is goal of this research to further explore the novel possibilities at the borderlines between the field of integrated circuit design and the above fields.

"The Sun provides the Earth with two types of energy.  The first is the radiant heat and light energy needed to sustain plant (photosynthesis) and human life and to drive weather systems in the atmosphere near Earth's surface.  The second type is the particle and magnetic energy carried from the Sun by the solar wind to Earth and deposited into the Earth's space environment, in the region called the magnetosphere where the particles are electrically charged and where are located hundreds of telecommunications satellites and an increasing number of astronauts for the Space Station and the Shuttle missions and future planetary missions.  Through the telecommunication satellites, business transactions involving hundreds of millions of dollars are facilitated each day.  The magnetosphere of Earth is its ""space environment"", in which the ""space weather"" can be nasty for both humans and satellites. During ""magnetic storms"", space weather conditions are very dangerous, so space walks are not performed and airline passengers are subjected to extra X-radiation in flights over the polar regions of the Earth.  The study of the magnetosphere and space weather is greatly facilitated by the SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network) which, as of Nov. 2007, will consist of 21 radars, 14 in the northern and 7 in the southern hemisphere.  These radars measure the convection pattern (the ""wind"" systems) in the space weather region.  The newest pair of radars is the Canadian PolarDARN pair at Rankin Inlet (operating since May 11, 2006) and Inuvik (November, 2007).  This SuperDARN pair is unique because it is designed to study the motion of the high latitude charged particles.  These motions are driven mainly by ""reconnection"" between the solar wind magnetic field and Earth's magnetic field, in which some magnetic energy is converted to energy of motion of the charged particles in the magnetosphere.  For the first time ever, ground-based radars (PolarDARN) will measure the reconnection-driven convection, which should lead to a much better understanding of space weather.","The Canadian SuperDARN/PolarDARN facility","Space and astronomy",CANADA,CANADA,"Space science"

Applications include urban management, planning and development; public safety; environmental management;  tourism; telecommunications; transportation; navigation; and e-commerce. Given the potential benefits there is an ever increasing demand for photo-realistic 3D cityscape models. However, current methods for efficiently building and updating 3D cityscape models are inadequate and need to be improved dramatically. Today's typical approach is to construct these models using stereo 3D digitization of aerial stereo-images. This manual-centric approach is inefficient and prohibitively time-consuming for building the large-scale 3D city models that are being, and will be, required for use in 3D geobrowsers. Thus, new techniques, methods and strategies are needed to greatly increase the speed and accuracy of 3D cityscape model generation and visualization for use at a massive scale. To address these new and important challenges, the research proposed here focuses on: a) accurate and complete 3D reconstruction of building facades with high visual quality of faï¿½ade textures; b) hierarchical reconstruction of 3D building rooftops produced according to level-of-detail for dynamic visualization; c) integrating 3D indoor and outdoor building models; and d) photo-realistic 3D reconstruction of trees typical of urban settings.","Enhanced 3D cityscape modeling for enabling the next generation geospatial web","Surveying and photogrammetry",CANADA,CANADA,"Cartography and geomatics"

Exploring new ways for densifying and pelletizing cellulosic biomass



Our long-term research goal is to develop mathematical models for design and optimum operation of handling systems for biomass feedstocks. Handling of unprocessed cellulosic biomass is costly because of its low bulk density. High moisture biomass is also prone to spoilage and physical degradation. A pelletized biomass would alleviate some of these problems but the conventional pelletization technology contributes to a low energy output-input ratio and increased costs. 

The objective of this Discovery research is to develop energy efficient methods for granulating and densifying biomass. We propose three approaches: (1) explore biomass pretreatment and alternative compaction options; (2) develop and validate equations for modeling and optimization; and (3) incorporate densification simulation in the supply logistics model (IBSAL) for sensitivity analysis of various logistical options. 

The proposed approaches involve a series of controlled and uncontrolled laboratory experiments.  The effects particle size, structural and non structural carbohydrates, lignin; and external forces (compaction, frictional) have on pellet density and durability will be investigated experimentally. The processes will be modeled mathematically for analysis and optimization. We will work with softwood (heartwood and bark), switchgrass and wheat straw as model cellulosic biomass. These biomass species represent excellent pelletability (heartwood and bark), medium pelletability (switchgrass), and low or difficult pelletability (wheat straw). 

The proposed research is planned over five years (2009-2014) involving the applicant, two Ph.D. candidates and  two M.Sc. research associates.

"The proposed research will employ the principles and methods of Supramolecular Chemistry and Crystal Engineering to create new molecule-based materials - microporous sorbents, inclusion (host-guest) compounds and co-crystals. 

   For the first time the molecules of lower peptides will be used deliberately to create solids with a system of regularly distributed, molecular-size cavities retaining significant amounts of another, guest component. Greenhouse gases, molecular organic species, flavors and drugs will be incorporated as guest components to yield new, exciting materials that may become elements of future technologies or alternatives to currently used food additives, cosmetic ingredients and pharmaceutical formulations.

   Low-dimensional coordination oligomers and polymers will be another type of building unit employed in our design of the supramolecular materials. Unlike numerous research groups working in the area and concentrating on a desired topology with high robustness, we will focus on finding an appropriate balance of stronger and weaker interactions in the host framework. Our alternative approach utilizes irregular host molecule geometries that prevent close packing in the crystal and enable the host to readily entrap guest species instantly developing cavity space when the guest is ready to enter.

   The materials will be synthesized, characterized for their fundamental properties (composition, structure, stability) and evaluated for their potential use. The research program involves the isolation of a range of new materials of which only a few will be selected for further, more sophisticated studies on phase equilibria and structural transformations (sorption isotherms, phase diagrams). This combination of research activities both in scope and in depth will increase our chances of succeeding in this pioneering, exploratory project, and also give young researchers, both beginners and experienced, the opportunity to engage in a novel scientific program with the potential for significant discoveries.","Supramolecular materials based on lower peptides and low-dimensional coordination polymers","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Materials structure, properties and testing"

"The main focus of this proposal is the study of soft matter, more precisely polymers and liquid crystals on different time and length scales, by merging together simulation, experiment and theory.  More precisely, I look at complex problems through a molecular physical chemist perspective, using a multi-scale approach where atomistic simulation is at the core.  The ultimate goal of such study is to establish the fundamental role of the cooperativity phenomenon inherent to the understanding of soft matter.  For that purpose, I mainly focus on 2 areas: furthering the understanding of the glass transition behaviour, and designing new performing liquid crystals for non-linear optical (NLO) applications.  

   A cooperativity length is directly related to the study of the glass transition.  I thus propose to confront simulation data to existing theories to specifically measure it.  The thermodynamics origin of the cooperativity length is first considered.  It thus allows a direct comparison between experimental and simulated data.  Correlation between simulation and theories is then considered.  For that purpose, 3 models that are currently employed to explain the perplexing phenomenon of glass transition are regarded: Adam-Gibbs theory, Mode Coupling Theory, and Coupling Model.  Data stemming from simulation enable a molecular interpretation of parameters intervening in the different theories.  The knowledge gained in the study of the glass transition in the bulk is applied to the study of the particular behaviour of Tg of polymers films on surfaces.

   Knowledge gained on the study of the cooperativity length on polymers is used to compute it in liquid crystal phases.  Despite its major importance in liquid crystals due to the long-range effect in the alignment of mesogens, it is not studied.  The strategy I then propose is not to specifically simulate mesophases, which is a long-time project, but rather I combine experimental measurements with data stemming from simulations carried out at different scales.  The association of quantum and atomistic levels is regarded in this proposal as an explicit case by designing highly performing ferroelectric liquid crystals for NLO applications.

"The great advances in the areas of telecommunications, computers and electronics have resulted in the integration of all sorts of information and services.  The boundaries between the different service providers have begun to erode. Thanks to technologies such as Voice over IP (VoIP) and IPTV, subscribers can receive their telephone, data services and entertainment from the same service provider. The integration of services, networks and media has resulted in emergence of strong demand for new services requiring considerably higher bandwidth than conventional applications. Providing these new services required by the customers at a competitive price is a challenging task for the communications industry. Another challenge is that with the increase in the number of mobile users requiring a level of service comparable to what they receive in their home or office, service provider have to be able to offer these emerging services anytime and anywhere. Facing these challenges requires optimized use of all physical resources available in the networks. 

The major objective of this research project is to develop data transmission strategies for distributed networks that approach as closely as possible the theoretical bounds on the maximum transfer rate and the best performance in terms of least possible bit error rate or the minimum distortion, given the resource constraints of these networks, namely power and bandwidth limitations. This objective will be pursued through an effort to find optimum cooperation strategies among the network nodes and to exploit the correlation between the information available at different nodes, the latter being particularly beneficial in the case of sensor networks. The basic enabling technologies would be essential to take advantage of the temporal, spectral and spatial diversity of the underlying multi-terminal wireless channel. The basic techniques used will be Network Coding, combined network and channel coding, combined network/source coding, multiuser detection, interference cancellation, and iterative detection.

"The introduction of wireless LAN and MAN standards such as IEEE 802.11 and 802.16 has created large wireless networks consisting of a myriad of links between various devices belonging to different users. This explains the recent surge of research activity in the area of large wireless networks. 

    )	The major objective of my research is to develop techniques for maximizing the amount of information transfer in large wireless networks.

    )	In spite of great advances in telecommunications technology and provision of many new services to the residential subscribers, many of the advance techniques including those in the area of wireless Ad hoc networks have not had their effects on the residential market. Penetration of these technologies has been extremely slow due to the concentration of researchers' effort on high end customized applications. This has resulted in ignoring the average civilian customer who is looking for a ubiquitous, high bandwidth solution at an affordable price. The objective of our research is to develop highly efficient, reliable and low cost data collection and transmission techniques for large distributed networks. The findings of our research will facilitate mass market deployment of these networks. While our research will be based on a solid theoretical foundation, our approach will be to dispense with those constraints and requirements imposed by specialized applications and to concentrate on the requirements of the mass residential market whose deciding factors are cost, durability and ability to easily support generic applications. 

    )	Successful completion of the tasks outlined in this proposal will result in increased competitiveness of Canada's telecommunications industry in providing a wide range of services to residential customers. It will also enable Canadian equipment manufacturers to manufacture and market the equipment required for the provision of these services to service providers in other countries.

"The research program outlined in this proposal involves fundamental studies aimed at improving our understanding of the fluid flow, heat, and mass transfer processes encountered in energy systems. This improved understanding will enable us to develop new design methodologies for more efficient, economical, and safe energy systems. The studies proposed in this program span a fairly wide area of research, including single and multiphase conditions, with and without phase change. The specific systems targeted in the proposed program include components in nuclear and conventional power stations, electronic packages, heat pipes, thermosyphons, refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, and flow distribution systems.

Our work on multiple discharges from two-phase headers has direct relevance to the safety analysis of CANDU reactors. Experimental and analytical studies are planned for improved prediction of multiple discharges from two-phase headers (simulating the CANDU header-feeder system during accidents). The proposed research on two-phase flow in tee junctions (impacting and combining) aims to produce new experimental data and theoretical models that could be used in advancing the design of flow-distribution systems, condensers, boilers, and heat exchangers, as well as identifying possible designs for simple and cheap separators. Research on reflux condensation will follow a rigorous approach in modeling the pertinent heat and mass transfer processes. These results are relevant to the design of heat pipes and thermosyphons, and the safety analysis of pressurized-water reactors during loss-of-coolant accidents. Micro-channel heat sinks are innovative cooling technology for the removal of large heat fluxes (as in advanced computers and fuel cells). Our work aims at advancing our knowledge on the transport processes at the micro-scale.

An important feature of the proposed research program is the training of highly-qualified personnel. We expect 10 graduate students (master's and doctoral) and one postdoctoral fellow to receive training in this program.

"A large number of practical optimization problems  belong to the class NP-hard and, unfortunately, there is strong theoretical evidence suggesting that optimum solutions for NP-hard problems cannot be computed efficiently. Approximation algorithms are fundamental tools for dealing with this class of problems,  as these algorithms can efficiently produce solutions that are guaranteed to be at most some factor c away from the optimum. Thus, a natural goal when designing approximation algorithms is to make this factor c as close to 1 as possible.  In this research we are mainly interested in studying approximation algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems of two classes: packing and network problems. Networks are one of the most fundamental modeling tools in optimization, with applications to a large number of fields. Packing problems are of great importance in transportation, VLSI design, scheduling, and any other area requiring the arrangement of objects in bounded spaces.



The objectives of the research are

- The design of new techniques and the improvement of  existing  ones for designing efficient approximation 

   algorithms that produce provably near-optimum solutions for packing and network problems.

- The creation of algorithmic techniques  for designing approximation algorithms that can use only a 

   pre-specified amount of time to try to produce the best possible approximate solutions for packing and 

   network problems. 

- The development of analysis techniques to accurately bound the quality of solutions  computed by 

   approximation algorithms.

- The development of techniques that can be used to experimentally estimate the accuracy of  approximation 

   algorithms for optimization problems and for improving their average  running times.

"In water and wastewater treatment processes, often chemicals (such as ozone, chlorine and its derivatives) are used to destroy harmful pollutants and microorganisms in water. Ozone is one of the most powerful chemicals that can potentially convert any organic water pollutant into CO2 and water and disinfect the water by killing microorganisms. Since ozonation of pollutants leaves no sludge residue, has minimum hazard to humans and is easily performed in one step with minimum space requirements; it is a method of choice for a large number of water and wastewater treatment problems. To increase the speed and reduce the cost of ozonation process it is possible to use suitable catalysts. Such a catalyst provides a desirable environment for both pollutants and ozone to come together on the catalyst active site at high concentration and to react preferentially. From the previous work, we have learned that long chains of perfluorocarbon groups bonded to an alumina support provide such a desirable medium for both ozone and hydrocarbon pollutants. The catalysts can increase speed of reaction and utilization efficiency of ozone leading to more desirable reaction conditions and lower cost of ozonation process. The long term goal of the proposed research program is understanding effect of different parameters on performance of ozonation catalyst and to use these findings to develop more effective catalysts for industrial use. The results of this study will increase our understanding of the nature of adsorption and heterogeneous catalytic reactions of ozone with pollutants in water. Development of a catalyst with high reaction rate and high ozone utilization efficiency will improve the technology and economics of using ozone in water and wastewater treatment processes. A compact, low cost ozonation system has many applications in water and wastewater treatment especially in remote areas and emergency relief camps.

"My main field of research is in Additive Combinatorics. The central problem of the area is to characterize additive or multiplicative structures.  I am especially interested in the ""incompatibility"" of multiplicative and additive structures. An old conjecture of Erdos and Szemeredi states that if A is a finite set of integers then the sum-set or the product-set should be large. The sum-set of A is defined as A+A={a+b | a,b \in A} and the product set is A*A={ab | a,b \in A}. Erdos and Szemeredi conjectured that the sum-set or the product set is almost quadratic in the size of A, i.e. |A+A|+|A*A|~|A||A|. The best known lower bound on the quantity |A+A|+|A*A| follows from an earlier work of mine, however it is still very far from the conjecture. The same problem was considered by Bourgain, Katz, and Tao, for the finite field case. Their result has important applications , not only to number theory, but to computer science, Ramsey theory, and cryptography. It turned out that methods from discrete geometry can be used efficiently not only for the real/complex case but for the finite field case as well. 

Another major focus of my work in additive combinatorics is Szemeredi's theorem and variants. Szemeredi proved in 1970 that every dense subset of integers contains arbitrary long arithmetic progressions. His famous theorem was reproved and extended by Furstenberg, Gowers, Rodl et al., and Tao. The most famous variant of Szemeredi's theorem is a recent result of Green and Tao, they proved that the primes contain arbitrary long arithmetic progressions. Earlier, I used the so called Removal Lemma to prove a multidimensional variant of Szemeredi's theorem which had only ergodic proof before. In my future work I want extend the combinatorial methods to prove furter extensions which have only ergodic proofs now.

"Stress has major effects on the brain and immune system.  Long-term stress can have serious negative consequences for the survival and function of nerve cells and immune cells.  In particular, early life stress can have enduring consequences on animals that last well into adulthood.



Glucocorticoids are hormones that increase in response to a variety of stressors.  These hormones are secreted from the adrenal glands and reach their distant targets (for example, the brain and immune organs) via the blood.  However, recent research shows that glucocorticoids can also be synthesized within the brain and immune organs themselves, particularly early in life.



This project focuses on the local synthesis of glucocorticoids during early development.  In particular, how are local glucocorticoid levels regulated by environmental stressors?  How do these local glucocorticoids act on nerve cells and immune cells?  Do local glucocorticoids have long-lasting or transient effects?  The answers to these questions will help us understand how stress affects young animals.","Steroids and songbird behaviour","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Behavioural neuroscience"
"Computer security remains a ongoing challenge for most computer users.  Existing technologies such as network firewalls, virus scanners, and automated software updates defend against many attacks.  Despite this, virtually every computer connected to the Internet has the potential to be compromised at any time due to administrative error, user mistakes, and unpatched software vulnerabilities.  As there is no ""silver bullet"" for computer security, this situation will continue for the foreseeable future. Thus, if we wish to secure the Internet, we need to develop defense strategies that can tolerate imperfections in our computer systems and in the humans who work with them.

     One strategy for addressing this problem is software diversity. The idea is if different computers run different software, then attacks that work against one won't necessarily work against others.  Many researchers have recognized the problems of the ""software monoculture,"" and there has been some work on automatically adding diversity to computer systems.  Past diversification approaches, however, only addressed a few classes of software vulnerabilities because they only changed the low-level details of programs: to a regular user, everything appeared exactly the same as before.  As an alternative, we plan to develop techniques for functional diversity, i.e., ways to make software behave differently on different computers.

     We plan to study two approaches to functional diversity.  One approach is based on anomaly detection: a computer should detect unusual behavior (by users or programs) and then react to those changes in a useful but highly variable way.  The other is to recombine different versions of a program together to produce new, slightly different versions, much as living things create new organisms through sexual recombination.  Through a combination of these processes we believe we can create computers that are specialized to their specific uses and thus are resistant to generic, mass attacks.

"The overall goal of my research program is to understand processes that contribute to variance in the heritable (germline) mutation rates of vertebrates. I propose two major lines of investigation: (1) experimental induction of germline mutations in mice and development of new mutation markers for field and laboratory studies, and (2) quantification of germline mutation frequencies in natural populations of birds exposed to environmental contaminants. For part (1) I will study repetitive DNA sequence mutations in the germline of mice. My program will focus on characterizing mutation induction in the eggs of female mice caused by mutagen exposure, and developing laboratory techniques that will enable reliable quantification of mutation frequencies using the most up to date genetics equipment. These new markers will facilitate future studies of feral mice, a useful sentinel species for contaminant exposures. For part (2) of my program I will develop new genetic markers for detecting mutations in birds and apply these to quantify germline mutation rates in natural populations. I will focus on species that have large population sizes and broad geographic ranges, some of which will be used for basic studies of variance in mutation rates, and others as sentinels for the effects of toxic environmental agents. This approach will enable me to address questions regarding variance in germline mutation rates due to: (a) pollution exposure from a variety of sources, (b) genetic differences among populations, and (c) sensitivity differences among sentinel species.

"Climate variability and changes have been often understood and predicted by means of state-of-the-art climate models. Such an example is climate model simulations for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In these models, the atmospheric component is primarily focused on the troposphere where most weather phenomena occur and most anthropogenic greenhouse gases are concentrated. The impact from the above, the stratosphere (from ~10 km to ~50 km above the ground), has often been ignored. Recent studies, however, have shown that stratospheric processes can influence the tropospheric circulation in a major way. It was found that, without realistic stratosphere, climate models can not reproduce recent trends in the North Atlantic Oscillation which dominates weather and climate systems over northeastern North America and western Europe. In the Southern Hemisphere, surface climate has been known to be directly affected by stratospheric ozone. 



In spite of growing evidence, our understanding on the potential role the stratosphere may play in the weather and climate systems is still lacking. The main goal of this research program is 1) to identify the impact of stratospheric processes (both dynamics and chemistry) on the climatology, spatio-temporal variability, and trends of the climate systems in the troposphere, 2) to find the mechanism through which stratosphere affects the climate systems in the troposphere, and 3) ultimately to better understand and predict the climate variability and changes. These issues will be addressed by analyzing climate model output from various international modeling projects and by integrating our own climate model. While this program is aiming to obtain better scientific insights on the stratospheric influence on the climate systems, we expect that it will directly contribute to the international effort on climate change assessment which has been led by the IPCC.

"Little is known about the mechanisms by which certain biological fibres attach to hard substrates.  Here the structure of the attachment interface is critical to the function of the system as a whole.  The protein fibers that anchor certain molluscs to rocks, for example, attach to surfaces with quite different mechanical properties from those of the mollusc itself, leading to potential interfacial mismatches.  Moreover, mussels must attach rapidly, underwater, to a wide variety of substrates, and with substantial force.



The freshwater zebra mussel is notorious in the Great Lakes region for its ability to attach to boats and water intake pipes.  Attachment of the mussel is achieved by means of a series of protein threads that connect the animal to adhesive plaques secreted onto the substrate.  While the composition of these protein threads and plaques has been studied, little is known of their structure, nor of the mechanisms of adhesion. I propose to investigate the structure, formation, and surface attachment of threads in the zebra mussel. My proposed approach involves structural characterization of the zebra mussel adhesive threads and of the plaque-substrate interface.  I will also synthesize molecules corresponding to fragments of the proteins that make up the threads and study them to gain insight into the critical elements of adhesion.



Understanding the mechanisms of zebra mussel adhesion could lead to non-toxic strategies for preventing biofouling, as well as providing lessons for overcoming the technical challenges of wet adhesion in dental or medical applications.  Principles of fibre attachment learned from the study of zebra mussels may also be relevant to other important biological systems, such as the attachment of ligaments and tendons to bones and teeth.","Biological fibres:  self-assembly, structure, and surface attachment","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Materials science and technology"

"I propose a significant expansion of my research program in the area of chemistry and materials science under extreme conditions, in particular, at high pressures. Pressure constitutes the third fundamental thermodynamic parameter which plays a critical role in regulating the structures and properties of materials. At high pressures, bonding patterns of molecules are significantly altered thus leading to the formation of new structures. In my laboratory, diamond anvil cells are used to achieve static high pressure conditions over a broad temperature range. Under the general theme of high pressure, we will carry out several projects. First, we will systematically investigate the high-pressure behavior of some fundamental molecules, such as hydrocarbons, coordination complexes and main group compounds. Studies on these classes of molecules will contribute to the fundamental understanding of various physical and chemical phenomena far beyond ambient conditions. In addition, we will investigate the structures and properties of a variety of nanomaterials, including metal oxides and boron nitride nanotubes under high pressures. Furthermore, we will develop functional materials with novel properties and potential industrial applications, such as hydrogen storage materials and zeolite materials. To understand the mechanisms underlying various high pressure phenomena, kinetic studies on model systems will provide critical information. In parallel to these efforts, we will develop analytical tools suitable for high-pressure research, including Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy as well as X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy. Many of these techniques will be developed at synchrotron radiation facilities. Overall, our research program will not only contribute to the basic research in high-pressure science, but may make significant impact on several economic sectors of Canada, especially the materials industry and advanced manufacturing.","Chemistry and materials development under extreme conditions","Physical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Physical chemistry"
"The business practices have changed dramatically in recent years, due to increased product variety resulting from manufacturing technology advancements, outsourcing as a result of information and transportation technology advancements, and more knowledgeable customers. The focus of competition has now shifted from the level of integrated supply chains to that of decentralized and independent firms collaborating with each other. Corresponding to this trend, we define the business characteristics of a product as price elasticity, supply uncertainty and demand uncertainty and the business characteristics of a market as the interaction of one business organization with other business organizations, i.e., decentralization, and its competition with other competitors. Some of these business characteristics are changing over the concerned planning horizon. On the other hand, most supply chain contracts are implemented under the assumption of constant business characteristics. If some business characteristics are changing, then the concerned planning horizon will be segmented into a number of ""independent"" stages. The selected supply chain contract is applied in each stage and the contract parameters need to be adjusted according to the business environment at that stage. The drawbacks of this approach are (1) ""oversimplified"" interaction between different stages and (2) ignoring the value of historical data in contract selection. To the best of my knowledge, no explicit attempt to address all business characteristics simultaneously in a changing environment has yet been undertaken. This research program is precisely to accomplish this. First, I plan to investigate the performance of any given common supply chain contract by taking both product and market business characteristics into consideration under a changing environment. Then, based on the performance anayisis, managerial insights will be provided to match business characteristics with features required in supply chain contracts to guide the design of supply chain contracts.  Most industries (particularly retail industry) are looking forward to seeing significant progress in this area.

Du point de vue pratique, nous visons ï¿½ pourvoir les manufacturiers avec des conditions opï¿½ratoires compï¿½titives et propres. Ce programme se veut non pas une ï¿½tude de la toxicitï¿½ des procï¿½dï¿½s de fabrication, mais la recherche des moyens pour prï¿½dire et limiter la production des particules dï¿½jï¿½ jugï¿½es dangereuses par les ï¿½pidï¿½miologistes et les toxicologues.

L'usinage propre, respectueux de l'environnement et de la santï¿½, que nous proposons est un programme intï¿½grï¿½ qui tient compte de la piï¿½ce, du procï¿½dï¿½, du fluide de coupe, des ï¿½missions de poussiï¿½res que nous voulons rï¿½duire et des copeaux.  Cette ï¿½tude devra engendrer 3 types de retombï¿½es : 1-amï¿½lioration de la productivitï¿½ et de la compï¿½titivitï¿½ des entreprises; 2- amï¿½lioration de la qualitï¿½ de la santï¿½ publique (qualitï¿½ de l'air dans les usines et qualitï¿½ de vie des travailleurs) 3-transfert technologique et innovation sociale.

"This proposal concerns primarily the modelling and simulation of power electronic voltage source converters (VSC) using intelligent or advanced control techniques to meet the increasingly complex and integrated utility demands. Such converters are mostly employed in the flexible AC transmission (FACTS) systems.



The use of FACTS based devices is needed in the next generation of integrated power system to control power flow over specified rights of way. Although this is an area of active research in academia, little is being done at the utility level to provide suitable models and tools to evaluate the performance and impact of such devices.



Since hardware implementation of these controllers is likely to be very expensive, the software modelling approach is being relied upon. The use of software tools, such as EMTP RV and other power system packages, which are standard tools within the industry (i.e. PSSE) are being used to 

(a) verify the models, 

(b) provide valuable guidance to the industry, and 

(c) to train the next generation of utility engineers. 



Strong links to local industry have been established so that the proposed research work will have a practical element.

"This ""Research Tools and Instruments"" grant application aims at obtaining the funds to acquire an instrumented nanoindenter which enables, for the first time, the microstructural characterization of the composite properties. This equipment is the cornerstone of my new research program to be launched at Laval University. 

My research program seeks for new design approaches which link material formulation to performances though the knowledge of the microstructure. The advantages of such microstructure-based approaches are numerous: (i) they lead to a better understanding of micromechanics phenomena governing the concrete durability; (ii) they offer a rigorous framework for material-to-structure design optimizations, directly from the material formulation; (iii) they constitute a more flexible approach to account for future improvements in material science. 

By financing the first nanoindenter equipment at the Laval University and Quebec, the NSERC-RTI grant will provide to my students an unique equipment to quantitatively characterize the microstructure properties of new composites, and to map their spatial distribution by means of Statistical Nanoindentation Techniques (STN). For instance, first applications of STN to cement composites have permitted to quantitatively characterize the intrinsic properties of Calcium Silicate Hydrates (C-S-H). Furthermore, in a recent work, I have coupled the mechanical analyses by STN with the chemical analyses by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to discover the a truly nanocomposite behavior of Portlandite nano-crystals within the C-S-H gel.

Finally, the microstructure properties are the fundamental input of continuum micromechanics models to predict the structural properties (i.e., stiffness, strength, etc.). In this context, we will employ statistical descriptors to describe the phase distribution, and to work with equivalent virtual microstructure. My students and I will capitalize such micro-to-macro design approach into engineering tools adapted to optimize new composites in high performance structures.

The nanoindentation equipment will be an indispensable tool for lunching my new research program on ""microstructuring durability"" at the Laval University, and it will employed to offer multidisciplinary training to students interested in developing new engineering approaches to optimize composite applications for the industry.

"We propose to study quantum materials using computational techniques.  Quantum

materials are materials where strong correlations or quantum mechanical effects

play a prominent role often giving rise to new phases and interesting new

physics, in some cases, such as graphene,  with a large commerical potential.

By strong correlation we mean that the electrons in the material do not behave

independently but instead all move collectively. Technically this is referred

to as a many body effect and presents a tremendous challenge to understand 

theoretically and analytical results are often impossible to obtain.

Fortunately, a very detailed knowledge of these materials can be obtained using 

computational methods. This is often very challenging but recent advances in

algorithms that allow for the simulation of the behavior of these materials 

using microscopic models has made this possible. It has now become possible to

study a macroscopiccally large number of particles and to completely

characterize their behavior using such techniques. In order to achieve this a

significant computational power is necessary and often several hundred

computers are being used in parallel, each one of them solving part of the

problem.  In it self the development of these algorithms is a theoretical feat

and the efficient use of them on parallel computers is a technical challenge.

The obejctive of this proposal is to develop such computational tools and to

apply them to the study of quantum materials.

"This proposal outlines research aimed at examining in detail the biosynthesis of the natural product Macrocidin A. Produced by the plant colonizing fungus Phoma macrostoma, Macrocidin A belongs to an important group of natural products known as tetramic acids. Interest in this molecule is sparked by the fact the P. macrostoma fungus has been shown by a research group led by Dr. Karen Bailey at Agriculture and Agri-food Canada research station in Saskatoon to selectively colonize broadleaf plants such as Canada thistle while leaving grasses such as wheat and barley unaffected. The broadleaf weeds appear bleached and stunted when treated with the fungus giving the unaffected grasses a competitive advantage. It appears that Macrocidin A is at least partially responsible for the effect on the broadleaf weeds. This work suggests that P. macrostoma may represent an environmentally benign alternative to traditional chemical herbicides. We are proposing to examine the biosynthesis of Macrocidin A in P. macrostoma and use this information to examine what role this compound may have in crop protection. This knowledge will form the foundation to examine individual enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway in P. macrostoma and to determine the role of each in the production of Macrocidin A. This project will be of theoretical interest to the wider community of natural products chemists as tetramic acids are a class of molecules with an interesting array of bioactivity. This research will help establish a program that will be equipped to examine other tetramic acids, and help advance the search for new and interesting biologically active molecules derived from Nature.

My primary objective is to uncover methods (processes and tools) that measure and improve upon the quality of IS services delivered to users.

"La production de l'aluminium (Al) se base sur diffï¿½rentes technologies qui constituent des variantes du procï¿½dï¿½ dit de Hall-Hï¿½roult (H-H). De 1900 ï¿½ 1999, la production mondiale de l'aluminium est passï¿½e de 8000 tonnes (t) ï¿½ 24 millions de t. Au  Canada, on en produit annuellement 2,7 millions de t. Le procï¿½dï¿½ H-H peut se rï¿½sumer ainsi : l'ï¿½lectrolyse de l'alumine dissoute dans un bain ï¿½ base de cryolite fondue nï¿½cessitant une tempï¿½rature comprise entre 940 et 980ï¿½C. Ce procï¿½dï¿½ requiert une cuve dite H-H et des matï¿½riaux rï¿½sistants des points de vue chimique, thermique et mï¿½canique. Depuis 1886, plusieurs avancï¿½es technologiques ont permis des amï¿½liorations notables au procï¿½dï¿½.

"To make weather forecasts, computer simulations of the earth's atmoshpere called atmospheric models are run.  Connected with this, computer simulations of what is happening on the earth's surface are called hydrological models, these models focus on trying to simulate flow of water once it hits the surface of the earth.  To do this they must keep track of among other things, the water content and temperature of the earth's surface.



Weather forecasts could be improved if there was a better exchange of information between these two types of models.  This proposal is to continue work necessay to connect hydrological models with atmospheric models for their mutual benefit. 



In previous years the investigators took a new approach to resolve the various differences between the two models. This was done as part of the MAGS/GEWEX/WCRP project for the Mackenzie and has recently been extended to various research bains as part of the Improved Process, Parameterization, and Prediction Project (IP3).

One of the reasons that it is difficult to make forecasts of the weather more than a few days into the future is the lack of knowledge of current conditions.  These forecasts could be improved with a better understanding of the current conditions on the earth's surface.

The objectives for each area are:  i) to further develop and experimentally verify a refined numerical tool to investigate liquid composite molding processes to manufacture net-shape parts of polymer matrix composites, which are new space-age materials.  At the end of this research, better understanding of the intervening phenomena is expected, which will lead to improved parts by contributing enhanced information concerning properties, such as permeability and tortuosity, to designers removing uncertainty and consequent ""trial-and-error""; ii) to investigate experimentally and numerically the possibility of controlling and steering a nanofluid - a ""base"" fluid with dispersed nanoparticles.  The nanoparticles to be used are ""doped"" multi-walled carbon tubes.  This research, if successful, will lead to unique opportunities in a wide range of processes including microfabrication, dynamic control and enhanced material properties.  At a macroscale, it can be envisioned the use of nanofluids using polymers as the ""base"" fluid and carbon nanotubes as the nanoparticles in the liquid composite processes; and iii) to study the microflows including the deposition of nanoparticles around a biochip that emulates the atherosclerosis of a diseased artery.  The biochip will be designed to take into account the most recent findings in cell culture, bio-nanotechnology, medical informatics and micro-visualization technology, and its primary focus will be on the role played by blood cells in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesions.  The fluid dynamics results are expected to elucidate about the difference in flow patterns between healthy and diseased artery wall, helping in this way the enhancement of currently available diagnostic strategies and tools.  The proposed program, in addition to the benefits just described, has the major advantage of providing for high caliber inter-disciplinary scientific collaboration at national and international levels, and excellent channels of dissemination of results, while facilitating the training of highly qualified personnel.","Numerical and physical modelling and characterization of nanofluids and fibrous medium flow",Engineering,CANADA,CANADA,"Modelling, simulation"
"This project introduces a new concept in cellular communications networks - that of autonomous infrastructure wireless networks. These networks are designed based on an enhanced 3G or future 4G physical layer with

enhancements that allow base stations and access points, i.e. cellular telecommunication network infrastructure, to be deployed automatically in an autonomous and organic fashion by the network users. This project introduces a vision for cellular networks that allows these networks to have the characteristics of WiFi networks in terms of ease and cost of deployment but with the benefits of cellular technologies that were

developed specifically for the infrastructure mode of operation and consequently display dvantages in terms of interference management - a weak point with wireless LAN networks such as WiFi. With these characteristics the autonomous cellular concept allows the development of 3G compatible cellular networks that have greater coverage, security, and stability, and at the same time the broadband characteristics of WiFi networks.  The proposed research follows a white paper that we have written on the topic with our vision for 4G at a time when the industry was focussing on other approaches such as integrated cellular/WiFi networks. After our introduction of this vision the industry is now highly interested on one aspect of this vision - that of femto-cells. These femto-cells are user deployed and self configured and meant to add small cell coverage to homes. The industry is currently following the concept of heterogeneous networks - i.e. networks that incorporate both the traditional cellular networks and femto-cells. Our view is that networks of the future will be homogeneous and incorporate the user deployed and self-configuration aspects through the whole systems depending only on power level for the base stations. The proposed research will advance the field through the development of interference management techniques and protocol enhancements to support the autonomous infrastructure architecture.

"A long standing and fundamental problem of AI research is this: the development of a comprehensive and general theory for representation and efficient reasoning about actions of agents operating in uncertain and incompletely known large-scale domains. The proposed research will contribute towards this long-term goal by eliciting structured logical representations and  subsequently elaborating them to guarantee efficient reasoning in structured domains. The proposed research focuses on representations of actions formulated in order-sorted first order logic and in description logic-based languages. The primary objective of the proposed research program is the theoretical development of those representations of actions and their effects that can be characterized as  modular, taxonomic or structural and the experimental assessment of these representations on solving the common reasoning tasks. This research is original and innovative for several reasons. First, it emphasizes the development of logical theories of actions that exploit the declarative structure of application domains: taxonomies of actions and objects.  Second, it proposes to integrate taxonomic reasoning about actions and about objects with order-sorted logics and modular description logic ontologies. Finally, it proposes to use these representational leverages to solving challenging and important problems in AI, including decision-theoretic planning and learning. While the proposed research program will help to advance our knowledge, it also has a significant promise of developing new logical frameworks, information technologies (and subsequently, software products) that will be relevant for a broad range of applications including health-care, Semantic Web services and industry.","Modular and taxonomic representations for tractable reasoning about actions","Information, computer and communication technologies",CANADA,CANADA,"Artificial intelligence (computer vision, use2603)"
"Microorganisms play an important role in catalyzing a wide array of biogeochemical processes that affect the composition of our soil, air and water.

   Geologists have shown that gold nuggets can grow as they move downstream.  However, as gold containing minerals break down at the earth's surface, these mineral weathering processes produce thiosulphate, a chemical that has the capacity to dissolve gold.  Lithotrophic (rock-eating) bacteria, which also live in these environments, can consume thiosulphate, forming new gold crystals.  I am interested in the role of these lithotrophic bacteria in making gold nuggets.  These biogenic crystals often possess unique chemical properties as well.  My hope is that the biological processes that we are working on can produce chemically important minerals, creating new, environmentally friendly bacteriological nanofactories.

   Prior to 2.5 billion years ago, the Earth did not possess a significant amount of oxygen in its' atmosphere.

   The history of life on Earth is preserved in a wide range of fossils.  While individual bacteria do not produce significant fossils, they have contributed to the pyritisation (fossilisation) of larger organisms.  I am interested in improving our understanding of these processes so that when we see these fossils, it will tell us more about the history of Earth.  These bacteria are also critical to the bioremediation of metal pollution.  Improving our understanding of how they've worked in the past may help us make them work better for us today.

   The history of life on Earth is preserved in a wide range of fossils.  While individual bacteria do not produce significant fossils, they have contributed to the pyritisation (fossilisation) of larger organisms.  I am interested in improving our understanding of these processes so that when we see these fossils, it will tell us more about the history of Earth.  These bacteria are also critical to the bioremediation of metal pollution.  Improving our understanding of how they've worked in the past may help us make them work better for us today.

"Forestry is one of the major industries in Canada and has a significant impact on our economy. It provides more than 800,000 jobs and contributes 3% to country's Gross Domestic Product. This important sector has been faced with many challenges due to appreciation of the Canadian dollar, intense competition from low-cost foreign producers, high cost of fibre, aging mills, real estate bubble burst in the US, and different tariff barriers. To remain competitive in the global market- place, the forest sector has to make difficult changes. Actions should be taken to diversify products and markets, invest in R&D, attract investments in the sector and introduce tax reforms.  Bioenergy and bioproducts have been identified as areas for research and potential product and market diversification. Similar to other long-term industry investments, the success of a bioenergy project depends on careful assessment of many different factors and proper decision making at different planning and engineering stages. Long term decisions include the decision on bioenergy plant location, biomass preprocessing facility location, storage capacities and location, feasibility analyses, logistics, transportation and handling of biomass. Planning and managing the entire supply chain of forest biomass is a challenge. Utilization of forest biomass requires deciding when and where biomass is collected, where it is preprocessed, how it is transported, how long and where it is stored to minimize the cost (or maximize the value generated) and satisfy the demand. Uncertainty issues in multi-site, multi-product supply chain planning problems are also important to be considered. 

The aim of this research is to develop mathematical programming models for forest biomass supply chain, incorporate uncertainties in the models, develop heuristic solution approaches to solve them in reasonable time, test and verify the models using numerical cases and apply them for case scenarios in British Columbia.

"One of the most powerful techniques in the life sciences is to be able to track individual proteins in cells and tissues with fluorescent tags.  



Laser light from a confocal microscope scans cells or tissues and excites and enables the visualization of the protein in an optical section.  In this grant, ZEN 2008 software and PC computer is requested for the confocal microscope in the shared microscope facility (in the Department of Biology at the University of Waterloo).  This new software provides more flexibility and useablility for the confocal microscope.  



A cheaper mechanism to optically section tissue is using structured illumination technology.  Apotome from Zeiss is requested.  Apotome enables optical sectioning of tissues and cells without a confocal laser.  Apotome produces confocal quality images, without expensive lasers, captured with fast acquisition times and requires minimal training for the user.



The combined upgrades for optical sectioning microscopy in the confocal microscope and Apotome willl increase the performance level of microscopy in the shared microscope facility (in the Department of Biology at the University of Waterloo).

"Conceptual combination is the process of combining information from two (or more) individual concepts to generate a new concept, as in, for example, combining what is known about dog and house to generate doghouse. This process is important in its own right, as it provides the basis for the process of compounding (i.e., the creation of multi-morphemic words, a common word formation process in many languages, see e.g., Libben & Jarema, 2006). Conceptual combination is also interesting in that 1) it provides information about the adequacy of theories of individual concepts in the sense that theories of concepts need to be able to provide the underpinnings necessary to account for conceptual combination and 2) it provides information about the relation between the language system and the conceptual system, because much conceptual combination occurs in the context of producing and interpreting noun phrases. The ultimate goal of this research project will be the creation of a more complete theory of relational interpretation of conceptual combinations. ""Relational interpretation"" refers to the fact that conceptual combinations (including compound words) are often paraphrased using relational links such as house FOR a dog, as the paraphrase for doghouse, or virus that CAUSES flu for flu virus (see, e.g., Estes, 2003, Gagnï¿½ & Shoben, 1997; Wisniewski, 1997).

"As concern for environmental stewardship rises, and the ecological and monetary expense of chemical inputs rises beyond societal thresholds, organic agricultural practices may become more and more important in western Canada, as they have in much of Europe. There have been few long-term studies on spring wheat production under organic conditions in Canada, and especially in the black soil zone of the Canadian Prairies. The proposed research is a continuation of a pioneering long-term NSERC Discovery Grant supported program (2003 on) related to the development of breeding and agronomic strategies for the organic production of wheat. 

Long-term objectives: 1) Develop a crop ideotype for spring wheat grown under low-input (organic) management; 2) Understand the underlying genetic mechanisms, and use that understanding to develop bread wheat varieties for production under low-input (organic) farming systems; 3) Develop long-term agronomic strategies for the organic production of bread wheat, in mixtures with other annual grain or pulse crops. These strategies will explore the potential of developing systems that serve to minimize energy inputs while maintaining the long-term energy balance of the agro-ecosystem. 



The objectives of this proposal are to 1) Determine whether breeding directly within organic environments is necessary for developing cultivars adapted to organic environments, 2) Screen wheat mapping populations for traits underlying competitive ability and yield in under low input (organic) and conventional environments, and determine heritabilities, potential QTL and breeding potential of traits uncovered; 3) Continue refining a wheat ideotype for organic environments; 4) Conduct agronomic research on wheat cropping strategies in mixtures with other grains and pulses under organic conditions; 5) Evaluate the nutrient uptake ability and agronomic performance of wheat genotypes grown under low (deficient) and sufficient soil P conditions.

"Memory decline is one of the hallmarks of normal aging and can have a significant negative impact on older adults' quality of life. Previous work by the applicant has shown that recalling the specific context of recent events is particularly difficult for older adults. For example, an older adult may remember hearing a story about an acquaintance, but may have trouble remembering where and when the story was told. The proposed research will examine whether older adults' context memory deficit can be minimized by introducing motivational incentives, such as monetary rewards, during learning. Reward-motivated learning has not previously been investigated in older adults. However, in younger adults, monetary incentives have been shown to activate a neural ""reward network"" which, in turn, enhances processing in a neighbouring ""memory network."" The proposed research seeks to determine whether the benefits of reward-motivated learning generalize to older adults. Of particular interest is whether older adults' context memory is boosted in the presence of rewards. Findings from this research will contribute significantly to current understanding of cognitive and brain plasticity in aging, and may lead to innovation in the design of effective memory programs for the elderly. The research will be carried out in three phases. Behavioural experiments in Phase 1 will establish whether reward anticipation improves memory in older adults, with specific attention to memory for context. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments in Phase 2 will provide insight into age differences in the brain activity patterns associated with reward effects on memory. Finally, quantitative modelling analyses in Phase 3 will use fMRI data to investigate age differences in the degree to which reward and memory networks show correlated activity and thus ""work together"" during learning. In sum, the proposed research represents a novel approach to understanding the cognitive and neural basis of age-related differences in learning and memory, and a potential avenue towards ameliorating older adults' memory deficits.","Motivated Learning in younger and older adults: Behavioural and neuroimaging studies",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Behavioural neuroscience --learning"

"The preservation of our aging inventory of bridges has become one of the most pressing challenges facing transportation agencies across the country.  By some estimates, approximately 30% of existing bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Clearly, there is a pressing need for effective bridge management strategies in order to optimize the utilization of the scarce resources available for maintenance, repair and replacement. With this in mind, the proposed research program will investigate two critical aspects of modern bridge management systems, namely condition assessment and life cycle performance prediction.

   First, a study will be undertaken considering improved reliability assessment methods for aging bridges through the use of structural health monitoring. As bridges deteriorate, bridge managers must continually re-evaluate remaining structural capacities to balance the imperative for public safety against the economic necessity for avoiding unnecessary rehabilitation and/or postponing decommissioning. The use of instrumentation to monitor traffic loading characteristics and the resulting load effects within the bridge can reduce the level uncertainty in structural evaluations, thereby enabling more precise quantification of the remaining reliability. Using a combination of in-situ monitoring and numerical simulations, a case study will be carried out featuring a 100 year old steel truss bridge. A variety of structural reliability assessment methods proposed in the literature will be considered, along with advanced damage detection techniques.

   The second component of the research program will investigate a novel approach for predicting the life cycle performance (i.e. deterioration) profiles of new and repaired reinforced concrete bridges. With existing methods either lacking a rigorous physical basis or requiring more detailed input data than is available in practice, the proposed deterioration model will link state-of-the-art mechanistic corrosion damage models with readily available bridge inspection and laboratory testing data through the use of machine learning methods (data mining, neural networks, genetic algorithms, etc.).

"The aim of this proposed research is to understand and improve the fermentability of Canadian malting barley.

Fermentability refers to the ability of brewing yeast to completely ferment wort sugars produced from barley

malt. Complete fermentation of wort carbohydrates is increasingly demanded by domestic and foreign malt

producers and brewers. Previously, Canadian barley breeders have examined factors that relate to

fermentability but have been hampered by the lack of a rapid fermentability test to accurately simulate brewery

fermentations. The production and export of Canadian malting barley, malt and beer is an unknown Canadian

success story. Canadian malting barley and malt producers continue to increase exports. By 2011 our barley

and malt exports are estimated to reach over $550,000,000 and $350,000,000 respectively. In 2005, Canadian

brewers exported 15.3% of their total sales (~$1,000,000) ranking Canada 5th among the world's beer

exporters. To maintain growth of Canadian market share in the competitive world market, the barley, malt and

beer quality and production efficiencies discussed in this proposal must be improved.

In order to address this industrial problem, a four-pronged research effort is proposed: (1) to verify a new rapid,

small scale fermentability assay with large scale brewing fermentations, (2) to understand of the influences of

barley variety and yeast strain on fermentability, (3) to begin screening for and the development of more

fermentable Canadian barley germplasm/varieties and finally (4) to examine the effects of common seed-borne

barley disease organisms on fermentability.

A further understanding of factors affecting malt fermentability and related test methods should result in

substantial barley variety improvement and an increase of related process efficiencies to make Canadian

producers more competitive in the world market. It is also proposed to hold a workshop for Canadian barley,

malting and brewing industry personnel at the end of this research.","Improved fermentability of Canadian malt","Processed food products and beverages",CANADA,CANADA,"Food processing, packaging, preservation and storage"

"Mathematical logic has long played a role in delineating between what is formally possible and impossible.  For example, Gï¿½del's incompleteness theorem shows that no consistent formal system sophisticated enough to prove simple theorems in mathematics can demonstrate its own consistency.  This type of result places a limit on the scope of what is formally knowable in mathematics.  In recent years, model theorists have taken on a constructivist approach to the use of logic inside mathematics.  Working below the ""Gï¿½del barrier'', they have formalized simple properties of structures that have desirable finiteness properties and which, at the same time, give rise to a rich collection of definable sets.  



Among the most successful of these properties is one that lives on the border of model theory and analytic geometry, namely, o-minimality.  This subject has already shown its usefulness by providing key insights into the foundations of dynamical systems, hybrid systems, and learning theory through neural nets and has helped settle major open problems in real algebraic geometry.  



The motivation for my research is the investigation of fundamental mathematical structures where the solutions of dynamical systems have definite asymptotic behaviour.  The novelty of my work is that this investigation is taken up from the point of view of model theory.  The main lines of my research can be roughly classified as follows: the discovery of new, rich o-minimal structures; the detailed analysis of recently produced examples; implications for analytic geometry of the discovery of these structures; and the investigation of generalizations of o-minimality.

"Vibratory surface finishing is a widely used manufacturing process for deburring, polishing, burnishing, texturing, hardening and cleaning metal, ceramic and plastic parts.  A bed of relatively large particles (typical dimension of media is 1 cm) is fluidized through vibrations and develops a circulatory flow into which parts are entrained and subject to the action of the impacting media.  The present proposal extends our previous research of the mechanics of vibratory finishing (VF) and the role of process parameters.  The results are applicable to a variety of related problems involving erosive wear, impact and the chipping of hard edges such as those found on cutting tools.

Abrasive jet micro-machining (AJM) is a relatively new, rapid, low-cost approach to the fabrication of structures for MEMS, opto-electronic and micro-fluidic applications.  A small, high-speed air jet is used to accelerate a stream of abrasive particles toward a target.  The resulting erosion of the target material can be controlled using masks and by varying parameters such as impact angle and particle flux density, velocity, and particle properties.  AJM can manufacture features that are difficult to make with traditional wet and dry etching-based techniques, such as multiple planar etch levels (depths) on a common substrate.  Its use with metals has interesting unexplored potential; for example, the manufacture of micro-molds, micro-fluidic heat exchangers, and surfaces textured for wear resistance and biocompatibility.  The use of AJM without masks offers the potential of much greater speed and lower cost, but the limits of its resolution need to be established.

"Conventional CAD/CAM software uses simple ""CSG"" block, etc. primitives combined with Boolean intersect, etc. operations to create 3-D models.  Sculptured B-spline curves and surfaces can be added, and ""evaluated"" to yield a topological set of ""B-rep"" bounded, volume enclosing surfaces.  In practice, the CSG to B-rep evaluation process involves inexact surface/surface intersections, and floating point round-off based exchange reliability problems remain.  Concurrently, stereo vision and laser triangulation systems, used to digitize design concept models, etc. into dense point clouds, have grown in acceptance.  These point clouds are converted to fitted B-spline surfaces and ""faired"" to smooth out curvature ""bumps"".  Use of B-splines reduces data storage requirements, and is compatible with the existing IGES/STEP exchange standards.  

   Ultimately, however, CAD models are converted back to point style representations.  Graphics hardware is based on rapid display of polygons that are created by ""tesselating"" from the B-rep model.  For manufacturing, Rapid Prototyping machines require STL triangle based file representations.  Ultimately, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining requires creation of tool paths that consist of (short) linear motions.  Their inherent reliability, combined with ever increasing computer speed and memory availability, has created a CAD research community trend away from CSG/B-rep and B-spline models to wholly point cloud representations.  The proposed research will harness this emerging trend, and extend early but successful applicant research from stereo vision and laser triagulation based sheet metal strain analysis to more general surface gray level and color measurement, point cloud based collision detection, and rapid prototype surface coloring using a 3-D Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) mounted inkjet printer head.  Additional potential applications include electrochemical etching for sheet metal and copper printed circuit boards, Computer Aided Tissue Engineering (CATE) by inkjet cell deposition, and haptic surgery planned using medical Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan data.

"The Coast Mountain Batholith (CMB) of British Columbia is the largest batholith in the North American Cordillera. A batholith is a very large volume of previously molten rock in the deep subsurface that worked its way upward and solidified. The CMB is an ideal natural laboratory in which to address an outstanding problem in Earth Sciences. The average composition of the continental crust is represented by andesite [a volcanic rock intermediate  between silicic (silicon oxides) and mafic (iron/magnesium oxides)]. However, melts derived from the mantle in all tectonic regimes are basaltic [a volcanic rock of mafic composition]. This discrepancy poses a fundamental problem for Earth Sciences: What processes generate an andesitic crust from basaltic rocks? We expect that the lighter silicic components fractionate and rise up, leaving a heavier ultramafic residue in the upper mantle. The residue may be so dense that it sank deeper into the mantle, or it may lay ""hidden"" below the crust-mantle boundary as a dense root. The BATHOLITHS project, primarily funded from U.S. sources ($4.6M over 5 years), investigates this problem through an integrated geological and geophysical study of the CMB. Seismic studies are among the most effective techniques for determining rock types in the deep crust and mantle. With NSERC funds of $286,500 over 3 years, Canadian scientists will participate as full partners in a major crustal-scale refraction / wide-angle-reflection (R/WAR) seismic program across the CMB. This contribution will bring nearly double our requested amount in U.S. funds to run the experiment, will provide access to the huge U.S. pool of seismometers (>2500 instruments), and will allow us to interact with U.S. and Canadian scientists from many Earth Science disciplines. We will share the significant discoveries to be made and promote the training of undergrad and graduate students who will become Earth scientists in industry, government and academia.","Seismic crustal structure and evolution of the Coast Mountains Batholith","Earth sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Earth science (see also marine geology 4604)"

"This research explores the dynamic factors driving arthropod population dynamics and integrates that understanding with work about evolution of arthropod life histories, habitat affinities and assemblage composition. We study arthropod roles in ecosystem function and predict community responses to stress and perturbation. Emphasis is on knitting ecological themes into an evolutionary context well connected to biological details of the focal organisms. We contribute to general explanatory frameworks in evolutionary ecology and apply these to landscape and renewable resource management. In addition, the program contributes to scientific syntheses about life-history theory, significance of interspecific hybridization and the new, and emerging science of biodiversity. Work proposed fits into 7 project themes: 1) insect assemblages on urban-rural gradients and how they may be conserved in the face of development and impact of invasive exotic species; 2) relationships between forestry practices and arthropod diversity, comparing effects of forestry with those of natural disturbances, and use mainly experimental approaches to elucidate tradeoffs between biodiversity and other values; 3) relationships between forest pests and characteristics of their hosts and natural enemies, and how these are affected by climate change; 4) how top-down and bottom-up food-web linkages affect evolution of life histories and how life-history traits evolve in relation to variable density, natural enemies and abiotic conditions; 5) why some species do not show the logical trade-offs basic to general life-history; 6) hybridization in semi-aquatic bugs in western North America, especially how population genetic aspects of tension zone models are best applied in mosaic zones complicated by movement and possible habitat selection; and 7) use of arthropods as indicators of wetland health and restoration, including the potential use of waterstriders as bioindicators of pollution and global change, such as changes in UV radiation and precipitation patterns. This work contributes to meeting Canada's commitments under the Rio biodiversity convention and to developing innovative strategies for sustainable forest management and management of pest species.

"Research on the patterns and processes of genetic variation in insects will be extended in new directions that build on the foundation of the three main lines of my previous NSERC-funded research:

1. Phylogeny and taxonomy in evolutionarily interesting groups of insects (particularly butterflies).

2. Speciation and species delimitation in difficult-to-resolve groups of arthropods.

3. Conservation genetics and biodiversity of grassland insects in western Canada.

       Most of my NSERC-funded research deals with butterflies of the swallowtail family, which are model organisms for studies spanning much of biology. In spite of their high public visibility, phylogenetic relationships of these butterflies have remained contentious. We are using multiple DNA sequences and morphology to provide the first robust, definitive, and comprehensive phylogenetic framework across any family of butterflies, and this will allow interpretation of evolutionary processes at multiple levels. 

        In contrast to butterflies, many arthropod lineages contain species complexes that are less charismatic but comprise major pests in agriculture, forestry and medicine. In my lab, work on these groups is focused on providing taxonomic resolution as well as fundamental insight into the genetic architecture of speciation. Currently, we are using genetic markers to understand the genomic structure of species boundaries in the spruce budworm species group. This approach will allow us to examine the linkage relationships of genes for several species traits in this major pest complex, and to more rigorously establish whether species differences in these moths are generally concentrated in the sex chromosomes.

       Finally, my students and I study the population genetics and conservation biology of selected grassland butterflies. These biodiversity studies merge molecular biosystematics with environmental issues such as land use and climate change. My efforts also contribute to training people who are knowledgeable about the ecology and taxonomy of insects, providing crucial support for both basic and applied research.

"We discovered a new chemical reaction a few years ago. We are now striving to optimize its yields and to widen its scope in the hope of making it a useful and prized reaction. The reaction transforms, in one step, a molecule, that consists of one highly reactive donor end (the carbene) and an acceptor end (the diene), into a more complex structure that includes rings and stereochemical (3-D) centers. It has the potential to help us build complex natural and unnatural molecules that could be tommorow's medicines. We have evidence that the reaction proceeds through a reaction mechanism that should allow us to predict the 3-D structure of the end product consistantly (a concerted mechanism). For that reason, we believe that studying in more depth the mechanism of the reaction will allow us to better understand how to augment the number of compatible substrates. We plan to do so and to then apply the new methodology to the synthesis of several natural products, in order to test its power and viability.

"Evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to mathematically model many important physical processes, ranging from to the interactions of sub-atomic particles to the motions of galaxies. These and other real-life problems are complex. Their solutions can only be simulated using a computer. However, a major advantage of using simulations in scientific discovery is the ability to generate data and analyze complex systems ""in silico"". This is particularly useful when real experiments are infeasible to carry out.



High-fidelity simulations often require complicated equations, complex geometries, and high resolutions in order to obtain meaningful data. Despite the advances in computing technologies, simulations of such models continually push the limits of our computing abilities. Moreover, it is discouragingly easy to produce simulations that produce spurious predictions such as negative values that are supposed to represent population sizes. Such solutions are deservedly viewed with skepticism. This combination of computational challenges makes the numerical methods employed a key factor in the efficiency and reliability of a simulation.



Accordingly the overall objective of this proposal is to discover, analyze, and implement optimized time-stepping methods for the numerical solution of evolutionary PDEs that model challenging physical phenomena.  Specifically we are interested in simulation-based investigation of high-speed compressible gas flows, electrical activity in heart tissue, and catalytic reactions for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve this objective, I also propose to develop problem-solving environments (PSEs) in which the research can be conducted. There is an increasing need for such PSEs as computing paradigms evolve to use massively parallel, multi-core, and/or hybrid computer architectures.

"The metal carbyne-mediated alkyne metathesis reaction represents a unique and efficient synthetic strategy for selectively forming C-C bonds, and it has proven to be particularly powerful in the construction of pharmaceuticals, polymers and biologically relevant molecules. Current strategies in place primarily employ tungsten or molybdenum catalysts. Unfortunately, these strategies suffer from a variety of drawbacks which have so far limited the technique. In this context, the focus of this proposal is the development of entirely new classes of ruthenium carbyne catalysts which are (a) efficient and selective alkyne metathesis initiators, and (b) offer improvements over currently available catalyst systems. Our decision to focus on ruthenium stems from the outstanding properties observed for, and widespread applications of, analogous ruthenium carbene catalysts in alkene metathesis reactions (the most prolific contributors to the development of the alkene metathesis reaction were co-recipients of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2005). In order to achieve these goals, we will be exploring (a) the role of multifunctional, hemilabile tridentate ligands in ruthenium carbyne chemistry, and (b) charge effects on stability and function of ruthenium carbyne complexes. Once we have developed and understood the function of our catalyst targets, we will then evaluate the catalytic performance of these new complexes as alkyne metathesis catalysts so that we may assess and compare their general utility.

"This geological and geochemical research proposal has four overall objectives:

1. To make major, international quality theoretical research contributions in the fields of (a) Early Earth (~2.7-3.5 Ga) geology and geochemistry, emphasizing determination of constraints on the chemistry and temperature of the Early Earth ocean/lower atmosphere system at ~3.2-3.5 Ga (e.g. Pilbara region, Western Australia), (b) determination of when the salinity structure of the Earth's layered ocean system became similar to the modern ocean condition, because trapped fluid evidence to date indicates that, older than ~2.2 Ga, the ocean system was characterised by a higher and very variable salinity, (c) ""hot cathode"" cathodoluminescence (CL) and the spectroscopic analysis of newly discovered CL effects, and (d) volatile accretion and volatile modification of minerals and chondrules in asteroidal materials preserved as meteorites in the growing ROM collection.     

2. To make significant applied research contributions in hydrothermal and sedimentary ore system science emphasizing, at present, platinum group metal mineralisation in the Sudbury area, Ontario and the origin of major, economic sedimentary Fe formations in northern Canada (e.g. Labrador/Quebec). 

3. To continue a very major commitment to training young Toronto-based HQP in theoretical and applied research. I particularly emphasize undergraduate research opportunities, as well as graduate and post-doc, and few things give me more pleasure than to see my undergrads. and grads. taking on productive, responsible and technically difficult positions in the workforce in Canada (e.g. Kidd Creek mine; Sudbury area; Toronto investment industry); and I have a good record.

"The European Space Agency's ExoMars mission to the Red Planet, scheduled for launch in 2011, comprises a sophisticated mobile science platform equipped with an array of analytical tools. The rover and associated science laboratory that it carries are designed to evaluate Martian surface materials and to assess the subsurface via a drill and geophysics package. The primary science goal is to test for evidence of past and present life on Mars. A critical piece of the equipment complement is the Close-Up Imager (CLUPI). This is a lightweight, high-resolution, robust micro-camera (weighing less than 200 g). It fulfills the role of the geologist's hand lens in providing macro- to microscopic images of Martian rocks and soils. It will be deployed on the end of a robotic arm (to ensure mobility and dexterity). Its prime function will be to help characterize Martian materials and to provide information that will enable the scientist team to determine whether more detailed analysis is warranted using the Pasteur Science Payload. This proposal seeks funds to develop innovative image analysis software to extract textural information from CLUPI digital data. Development of a texture analysis capability will enhance the science return of CLUPI, as well as augment CLUPI's ability to support additional rover functions. The goal is to develop an autonomous mineral and rock identification package that will improve the effectiveness of CLUPI as a first-order sample evaluation tool. Given the launch date of 2011, there is a limited window of opportunity to develop an intelligent vision system, which will represent a distinctly Canadian contribution. This proposal seeks funding for three years (2007-2010), which is considered a realistic timeline and investment to secure a viable package. As well as supporting the ExoMars mission objectives, and respresenting a timely and unique research opportunity, the development of the image analysis system will provide for new applications on other planetary bodies (e.g., the Moon), as well as here on Earth. The ability of CLUPI to take colour, stereo, high-resolution images will provide excellent insight into the geology of the landing site, and may facilitate the identification of the first extraterrestrial structures of biological significance.

"The general aim of my work is to develop new methods or insights that aid in understanding physical phenomena on topics of current interest. With this grant I will continue the development of (1) new methods and approaches to finite periodic systems and (2) semi-classical approximations.  The applications are to  (a) electrons in semiconductor nanostructures, (b) photonic crystals, and (c) cold atoms. 

One of the methods which we have greatly improved is called Coupled Wave Theory (CWT), originally developed by Kogelnik for holograms. His version had just one transmitted wave and one reflected wave, but it is seldom reliable. We devised a semiclassical CWT which combines the simplicity of conventional CWT with the accuracy of exact calculations. It produces analytic estimates of the band widths and other properties of a photonic crystal. As it stands the theory needs some extension, to cover the case of total internal reflection, and we are working on that.

A second area of application is to cold atoms. During the past ten years physicists have learned how to create a new state of matter by cooling atoms to extremely low temperature. This is called a Bose-condensed state. Essentially the atoms lose their identity and behave as a single quantum fluid.  If they are released from the trap, a coherent beam of atoms emerges with some similarity to laser light as opposed to ordinary light. One of our aims is to devise a velocity filter for such a beam, to gain better control over this new state of matter. In the past six years we have learned how to make such a filter for electrons in semiconductors and we hope to apply that to atoms.

"This research is designed to obtain a more complete understanding of factors affecting the accumulation of odorous compounds, skatole (3-methylindole) and the 16-androstene steroids (especially androstenone), in pigs. These compounds cause undesirable off-odors and off-flavors (boar taint) in pork meat produced from uncastrated male pigs. The 16-androstene steroids are produced by the testis near maturity and act as sex pheromones, while skatole is produced by bacteria in the gut and contributes to the characteristic odour of pig manure. Male pigs are routinely castrated at an early age to prevent boar taint, but castration raises concerns about animal welfare, as well as decreases the growth efficiency and lean yield of the pigs.

The goal of this research is to understand the regulation of the biochemical and physiological processes that affect the accumulation of boar taint compounds in pigs. We plan to further investigate aspects of the metabolism of androstenone and skatole including: examining the role of cytochrome b5 isoforms and CYP17 in the synthesis of 16-androstene steroids; determining the role of various cytochrome P450 isoforms in skatole metabolism; determining the potential role of sulfatase in androstenone accumulation in fat and investigating the role of glucuronidation and the enterohepatic circulation in androstenone accumulation. We also plan to study the integration and regulation of the metabolism of androstenone and skatole via nuclear receptors (CAR and PXR) including: identifying the endogenous compounds that affect CAR and PXR in the boar; conducting in vivo studies with CAR and PXR agonists to determine the role of these receptors in boar taint and further characterizing the genes that are regulated by CAR and PXR. This information could be used to find alternative methods to control the boar taint problem so that castration can be eliminated.

"The goal of our research is to understand how microscopic structures such as the mitotic spindle assemble in living cells.  Like most complex 4-dimensional biological processes, a complete understanding of spindle assembly will depend on knowledge of the properties of individual components as well as an appreciation for how their assembly is orchestrated in living cells.  We use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study this problem because microtubule structures are assembled and disassembled rapidly in the first cell division, and many regulatory molecules are likely required to provide the instructions.  The importance of microtubules to cell division, and their sensitivity to such molecular instruction, is perhaps best evidenced by the fact that many anti-cancer drugs target the microtubule polymer (e.g. Taxol and Vinblastine).  However, we do not have a complete understanding of how microtubule growth and disassembly is regulated within the cell.

  By using a combination of suppressor genetics and RNA-mediated interference, we will search for genes that are required for microtubule processes in the first cell division of C. elegans.  This will be accomplished by focusing on two distinct pathways of regulation.  The first involves the regulation of protein phosphorylation at the centrosome (a structure that nucleates the majority of microtubules in the cell).  We hope to identify proteins that are carrying out the orders of a signal that instructs microtubules to ""build a mitotic spindle"".  The second project will focus on the identification of a gene that, because of its mutant phenotype, is likely required to coordinate microtubule behaviour at a time when the early fertilized egg prepares for the first mitotic division.  Together, these pathways provide an ideal starting point to discover novel regulators of microtubule dynamics and will likely further our understanding of cell division in higher eukaryotes.

"This research program studies the strengths and limitations of randomized algorithms in various computational settings. A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that has access to a source of random bits and uses it as an auxiliary input to guide its behaviour. During the last two decades, understanding the role of randomness in computation has been an fascinating area of research leading to several fundamental results. 



It is now well known that randomized algorithms are capable of performing some computational tasks much more efficiently than known deterministic algorithms in specific settings, even those that are impossible deterministically. There is also good evidence that randomization does not give additional power in a general setting.



However, our understanding of the true power of randomness as a resource is still far from complete. The goal of this proposal is to further explore the power of randomness in various computational models and to find new applications of these results to other areas of computer science.

"The tropics contain the majority of the world's biodiversity, yet many tropical ecosystems remain poorly studied. My research aims to understand how species in a Costa Rican tropical rainforest control the flow of energy and nutrients, at both small and large scales. At the smallest scale, I study the insects and other animals that live in water-filled plants called bromeliads. Here I am interested in how the dynamics of this system in Costa Rica compares with that in regions with fewer species (e.g. Caribbean) or more species (e.g. Brazil). I am also studying how the different spatial ranges of predators and prey affect the dynamics of the whole food web.  Although this is a tiny ecosystem, it is easily manipulated, allowing us robust tests of ecological theory that are impossible in large ecosystems. At the largest scale, I study how the ongoing conversion of intact forests into agricultural lands has affected ecological processes and energy flow, especially in fragments of remnant forest. To enable the continuation of this research, I have requested funds for two new all terrain vehicles to replace my current vehicle.

"Syndromic surveillance is the monitoring of the health of a population using datastreams such as emergency department visits, calls to telehealth, over-the-counter drug sales, laboratory reports, demographic information, etc. One major activity in this surveillance is the use of aberration detection algorithms to alert public health officials to a possible disease outbreak situation. While these systems have been successfully used in the field, they have not proven to be easy to extend and thus many new and interesting aberration detection algorithms are not being tested and deployed. This research program is developing a framework to aid in the development of aberration detection software systems using the concepts and tools of the semantic web.  The research will conceptualize the entire process of information system development in the form of an ontology for algorithm selection, composition, deployment, testing and evaluation. The resulting ontology and related reasoning systems will facilitate the abstraction of the information system development process into a form of description that is accessible to the public health domain expert (or in fact, any domain expert who does not have software expertise).  A proof of concept will be developed around the case of stochastic algorithms such as artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs are often perceived as complex, mysterious and too difficult to handle for the end user. There are many stages in the design, deployment, testing and evaluation of ANNs that are distinct from other types of algorithms  and an ontological description of this could be used by an information system development system to correctly integrate ANN methods into an aberration detection system. A further ontological description of the implementation phase of an algorithm could also be developed that would facilitate the use of distributed computing resources by a surveillance system in a method that is transparent to the user. Once again, this is another area (Grid or Cloud Computing) that is overly complex for the end user but has great potential to extend the computational capability of many applications (particularly in the life sciences) that often do not take advantage of available computational resources.

"My research has shown that fish have evolved to detect and respond adaptively to prostaglandin and steroid hormones naturally released by other individuals of the same species. I currently am studying four aspects of how these 'hormonal pheromones' function to synchronize fish reproduction. 

1. Hormonal pheromones in goldfish, a cyprinid fish:  Because a male goldfish's reproductive success depends only on his ability to fertilize eggs during competition with other males, males have evolved mechanisms that adjust both the quality and quantity of releasable sperm in response to hormonal pheromones and other cues from males and females. In current research, I will determine how the temporal patterning of exposure and interactions among cues influences these sperm responses.

2. Hormonal pheromones in other cyprinids: Our field studies in wild Swedish cyprinids suggest that crucian carp use the same hormonal pheromones as goldfish, whereas other cyprinids do not. Our current studies will determine the volume of water in which hormonal pheromones of crucian carp can be detected, and also look for evidence that cyprinids may have different strategies for releasing their seasonal production of sperm.

3. Cichlid hormonal pheromones: The finding that fish use hormones as pheromones raises the important question of how steroid hormones (which are very similar among fishes), could function as species-specific cues. I will record from the olfactory organ of cichlid fishes to determine if differences in steroids they detect provides evidence for evolution of species-specific pheromones, or changes due to other evolutionary mechanisms.

4. Spawning synchrony in ""nest associates"": Many North American cyprinid ""nest associates"" spawn in nests constructed by other species, with which they synchronize their spawning. We will determine if hormones released by nest builders mediate this synchrony and, if so, whether these cues are the same as those synchronizing male-female activities within nest associates.

"Diamond exploration and mining is a rapidly expanding industry in Canada. Research into the formation and dissolution of diamonds and the chemical and mineralogical composition of various diamond sources deep within the Earth's mantle provides a framework for the interpretation of geochemical exploration data. Minute mineral inclusions trapped within their diamond hosts billions of years ago can be used as time capsules to study the formation of early continents and the origin and evolution of their deep-reaching mantle keels. The geochemical analysis of micro-inclusions will be supplemented by studies of physical and chemical properties of their diamond hosts (stable isotopes, abundance and aggregation level of nitrogen impurities). Deep seated xenoliths and xenocrysts document the composition, thermal state and redox conditions prevailing in the deep lithospheric mantle at the time of kimberlite eruption. Combining diamond and xenolith studies thus allows assessing the evolution of cratonic roots through time.



Four topics of major scientific importance and of direct relevance to the diamond industry will be studied:

1. The conditions of diamond formation will be constrained through studies on the trace element characteristics and the redox state of diamond precipitating fluids/melts.

2. Stable isotopes will be employed to examine a possible relationship of ""super-deep"" diamonds to ancient sea floor recycled back into the deep mantle.

3. The assumed co-genetic relationship between micro- and macro-diamonds, regularly employed for diamond grade predictions, will for the first time be rigorously assessed through a detailed geochemical study. 

4. Diamonds from recent discoveries in Canada and from an unconventional diamond deposit in a crustal setting of unusually young age in Brazil will be studied to enhance our understanding of the variability of diamond source rocks in the Earth mantle.

"Reverse engineering the human operating systems that run cellular communications and control is likely to be one of the major biomedical challenges over the next 20 years. However, the dividends of these efforts will be improved diagnostics and therapeutics for personalized medicine delivery. In the current proposed research program, Kinexus plans to undertake several projects with Dr. Stacho's team that will support its overall ambitious goal of creating high resolution maps of cell signalling networks that are gender, age, tissue and disease-specific.

The whole project is divided to 4 subprojects. The main goal of the first subproject is to identify human phosphorylation sites which are highly conserved in other species. Such conserved sites must play an important role in the signalling processes in cells and in our research we want focus on these first. The second subproject will be targeted on identification of accurate motifs in phosphorylation sites. This has a potential to help in the discovery of many unknown phosphorylation sites which seems a necessary condition in understanding signalling processes in cells. The goal of the third subproject is to study interactions between protein-tyrosine kinases, their phosphoprotein substrates and the SH2 and PTB binding proteins that associate with the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in these substrates. Such proteins are highly probable to interact with the tyrosine kinase. Experimental verifications done by Kinexus of the results found in all above subprojects will be used to improve the algorithms, thus reducing the cost in discovery of new phosphorylation sites. The goal of the last subproject is to apply the methods developed in the previous subprojects in finding new unknown phosphorylation sites in human proteins and to build the kinase pathways networks from the collected data. Building and comparing a comprehensive and user friendly interaction networks of healthy and diseased individuals could be used for novel diagnostic techniques. Since such networks provide deeper understanding of signalling processes in cells, they could be a useful tool in drug discovery.

"Advances in the field of condensed-matter physics often require the discovery and development of new materials that extend or challenge the current understanding. The proposed research addresses both the synthesis of new materials and the investigation of their physical properties. This proposal focuses on one specific class of materials that are of current interest, namely quasicrystals.

In addition to the basic crystalline and amorphous structural forms of solids, a new phase of matter known as quasicrystals was discovered in 1984. This phase has a new type of long-range translational order, called quasiperiodicity, and a non-crystallographic orientational order associated with classically forbidden symmetry axes. A central problem in condensed matter physics is to determine whether quasiperiodicity leads to physical properties which are significantly different from those of crystalline and amorphous materials.

How do the electrons behave in a quasiperiodic environment? What is the nature of the electronic states in quasicrystals? What magnetic ground states are allowed in quasicrystals? More than two decades after the discovery of quasicrystals, these questions are still hotly debated by researchers. The proposed research addresses these outstanding questions via the synthesis of several families of quasicrystals and corresponding crystalline approximants and the investigation of their physical properties with the magnetization, neutron diffraction, electrical resisitivity and magnetoresistance, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and photoemission spectroscopy techniques. The end product of the proposed research will be a much clearer understanding of the intrinsic magnetic, electronic transport, and electronic structure properties of quasicrystals. A dozen of graduate/undergraduate students will acquire a range of practical synthesis and measurement related skills as well as in-depth understanding of various magnetic and electronic phenomena. In addition, the availability of well-characterized quasicrystals will provide the field in general with a new toy-box of samples for investigating the physical effects of quasiperiodicity in solids.

"Manitoba is known as a water province - a province rich with flowing streams and sprawling lakes.  But how much water is there really?  And how much can be used, ensuring there will always be enough?  These questions are not usually asked by Canadians, even though our daily lives and all the comforts of home we enjoy depend on the answers: everything from turning the lights on to flushing our toilets.  



This research helps water managers and utility operators to answer questions of how much water there really is, where it all comes from, and how long we can depend on it.  The answers can be provided by the WATFLOOD hydrological model, which is being developed for specialized use in northern Canada to tell water regulators and operators where the water in our river systems is coming from.  The model helps regulators to look at how water gets into streams (i.e., along the surface or through the ground), and includes details such as how much water is lost back to the atmosphere from evaporation on hot, dry days.  This research specifically looks at water loss due to lake evaporation in northern Canadian shield environments, information critical for regulators in control of how much water may be safely be removed from river systems, and for hydroelectric power production.  



Central to this research is also the key to answering how much water Canadians will have in the future.  By running the model using many possible future climates (temperature and precipitation), changes in river flow can be analysed based on differences between today and 10, 40, and 70 years into the future.  This information helps utilities, such as Manitoba Hydro, to more efficiently design today's infrastructure and plan for future flow and power production needs: ensuring the lights will never go out.

"Rangeland occupies 47% of the Earth's land surface and represents a major source of food production. There are 40 million acres of native rangeland in western Canada. Rangeland is crucial to sustain soil quality, enhance the availability of clean water, sequester carbon dioxide and maintain biodiversity. Improper rangeland management practices can cause severe degradation that can lead to irreversible changes of this ecosystem. There is an urgent need for timely information on the state of rangeland for the protection of these resources and long-term sustainability. 



The project's goal is to map fractional (percent) cover of surface material such as green and dead vegetation and soil from high-spectral resolution satellite data for monitoring rangeland in Alberta. For this purpose, specific remote sensing technologies will be developed to derive to the fractional products. They will directly act as important inputs for the rangeland management and, subsequently, will help to reduce the cost of rangeland monitoring and assessment and provide timely input for decision making by various levels of government. These products also provide the necessary support to properly manage this fragile ecosystem over time for optimization of economic and social values to ensure its long-term sustainability. The developed technologies will reach far beyond rangeland monitoring, benefiting other applications, such as climate change, geological mapping and forestry monitoring, where repeated large-scale mapping as provided by satellite systems is required. In addition, the research program provides important training opportunities for students at the leading edge of remote sensing related to an ecosystem important for our society.

"The Department of Biological Sciences, UofA contains a world-class aquatics facility housing various fish species. These animals are essential for the ongoing NSERC-funded research programs of the nine investigators participating in this application. Fish are cold-blooded vertebrates whose body temperature matches that of the water temperature and are dependent on thermally regulated water for their survival. Approximately ten thousand fish are maintained in our aquatics facility and with the recent hiring of an environmental toxicologist (K. Tierney, 2009) these numbers will increase. Depending on the fish species being studied and the types of experiments performed, incoming water from the City of Edmonton needs to be consistently cooled to 10-17 C for trout, salmon, carp, and goldfish or warmed to 25-28 C for zebrafish and catfish. The cooling and heating of this water is accomplished using a brine-based recirculation system and steam, respectively. Water cooling is facilitated by a vapour compression refrigeration system that uses a 30 tonne chiller unit designed to remove and discharge heat from a circulating brine solution. Major components of this system are the chiller unit, a refrigerant evaporator, and a brine circulation pump. In September 2009, detailed inspection of the brine chiller system found that it has developed leaks due to corrosion in the evaporator that allows brine to directly enter and cause irreversible damage to the chiller. Oxygenated brine and cavitations also corroded the pump beyond repair preventing it from adequately circulating brine. This is not an issue during the winter months (October-March), however, in the spring and summer this damage will completely inhibit our ability to chill the incoming water. In this proposal we are requesting funds for the purchase and installation of two evaporators and two pumps required for our brine-based cooling system. The additional evaporator and pump will serve as stand-by units allowing for routine shut-down and maintenance, a strategy that will maintain our cooling system in operation for more than 10 years. We already have acquired a new 30 tonne brine chiller to replace the damaged unit and only installation costs for this item is requested.

"One of the most important roles of the immune system is to prevent the growth of infected or damaged host cells. For example, cells infected with viruses or those found within tumors are recognized as abnormal and efficiently destroyed by specialized white blood cells called lymphocytes. Without this recognition system viral infections and malignant tumors would spread throughout the body. Therefore, understanding how lymphocytes determine if a cell should be killed or spared has been the focus of intense research over the years. These experiments demonstrated that lymphocytes use an intricate network of cell surface proteins to survey surrounding cells for signs of infection or damage. These proteins (or receptors) often recognize a common protein presented on the surface of neighbouring cells, which is reduced or lost once a cell becomes infected or transformed by cancer. Loss of this protein then marks these cells as abnormal and they are subsequently targeted for destruction. This essential mechanism is well studied in humans and mice but little is known in other vertebrate species that encounter viruses and must limit the spread of cancerous cells. Therefore, I am interested in understanding how fish immune cells mediate these important immune responses. Fish lymphocytes function in a similar manner as their mammalian counterparts but the identification and characterization of the immune receptors that regulate these responses is lacking. Recently, I identified a new family of immune receptors in the channel catfish that are related to receptors in mammals involved in immune surveillance for virally infected or cancerous cells. Characterization of these unique catfish receptors represents an excellent opportunity to study the evolution and function(s) of innate immunoregulatory receptors. This will not only enhance our present understanding of fish immune responses but will also provide important information regarding innate immune receptor protection mechanisms throughout vertebrates. Catfish are also a valuable aquaculture crop and a further understanding of their anti-viral and anti-tumor defense mechanisms will allow for improvements of fish health in aquaculture practices.

Studies will be realized through an exhaustive, multi-disciplinary approach by correlating the plasma characteristics obtained using a wide variety of optical, electrical, and wave diagnostics, the properties of processed materials determined by both in-situ and ex-situ analysis, and the characteristics of micro- and nanofabricated devices. The basic knowledge generated from these fundamental studies is expected to play a crucial role in the optimization and development of plasma-based processing tools that will be needed to meet current and future challenges in micro and nanoscale device manufacturing. This program also represents an excellent complement to actual research efforts in Canada, in particular those associated with the implementation of the ""Laboratoire en Science et Applications des Plasmas"" recently awarded by the CFI and Quebec government. Moreover, since it deals simultaneously with the physics of low-temperature plasmas, the physics and chemistry of surfaces and interfaces, and the design, fabrication, and characterization of advanced micro and nanoscale devices, this program is expected to lead to the training of highly qualified researchers with unique intersciplinary skills that can easily be integrated in various Canadian high-technology sectors.

"In order to interact in our environment during everyday activities, the central nervous system (CNS) must identify and extract relevant sensory information from a vast array of concurrent inputs from multiple sensory modalities.  Such processing is essential for accurately controlling movements, learning novel motor skills and successfully relearning movement patterns following brain injury.  Sensory inputs initially arrive and are processed at very distinct, modality specific areas of the cortex before being integrated in sensory association cortices. Previous research has provided detailed characterization and mechanistic information regarding how sensory inputs within a specific modality are represented during movement at a relatively early cortical level.  For example, our ongoing research suggests that selection of somatosensory information begins to occur at the very earliest stage of cortical processing, the primary somatosensory cortex, during sensory-guided movement and perceptual discrimination.  Highly selective mechanisms appear to be involved, including inhibition of ascending cortical paths carrying task-irrelevant information and facilitation of those carrying task-relevant information.  The specific regions that control this selection are unclear, however interactions between the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, multimodal sensory regions and primary unimodal sensory cortices appear to play an important role.  However, much less is known about how these mechanisms of control are altered when the central nervous system is presented with multiple sources of sensory inputs, as is usually the case during natural movement.  Our current work suggests that the cortical representations of competitive visual and tactile input change substantially depending on the task-relevance of the stimuli and on the spatial and temporal relationship between visual and somatosensory information.  As such the proposed research program will focus on developing fundamental understanding of the interactions and integration of sensory inputs from multiple modalities at a cortical level and the role this plays in the acquisition and control of normal limb movement.","Multimodal sensory modulation and human motor control","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,Neurophysiology

"Large-scale quantum phenomena are particularly interesting in condensed matter systems, although they have also been studied in particle theory and cosmology. Their theoretical understanding needs extensive results from the theory of decoherence and non-equilibrium processes in the environment. The present work focuses on cerain statistical mechanical models (notably on models of spin networks coupled to environments modelled by oscillator or spin baths), and on their application to real systems. Such systems include networks or arrays of magnetic molecules or rare earth spins, or of supeconducting SQUIDS. The models also can be applied to quantum spin glasses or dipolar glasses. Finally, in this project we will also look at solid He-3, in whihc we believe that spectacular quantum phenomena involving macroscopic domain walls may be observable. 



The main theoretical focus will be on an understanding on the dynamics of spin 

networks, using methods from decoherence theory, and also from quantum information theory and string theory. Models to be studied include the dissipative Hofstadter model, as well as a general study of 'quantum walks'. 



The most important part of the project will be the application to experiments on spin arrays (of magnetic molecules and rare earth ions), on dipolar and quantum spin

glasses, and on solid He-3. We will be 

mainly looking at phenomena related to experiments like spin echo, magnetic relaxation, and thermodynamic and transport measurements (and NMR in the He-3 system).

We will also be looking at neutron scattering experiments, in the context of work on the dynamics of quantum phase transitions in quantum spin glasses. There will be extensive collaboration with experimentalists, working mostly in magnetism but also in glass physcs (and possibly also in superconductivity), and also with some theorists.","Large-scale quantum phenomena in spin systems","Physical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Theoretical physics and chemistry"

"The purpose of this program is to study applications of curvature flows to convex and affine geometry. Its main part concerns flows of convex hypersurfaces by certain powers of the Gauss curvature. In essence, these flows will be studied to understand how a hypersurface evolves in time to a more optimal shape and to get significant information on these asymptotic shapes.



One of the famous questions that arises within the Brunn-Minkowski-Firey theory of convex bodies generalizes the classical Minkowski problem of finding convex bodies with prescribed curvature function. In the extension of the classical problem, one seeks convex bodies with prescribed L_p curvature function, a question which generated a lot attention in view of its further applications in other areas like information theory. Past work that we did on a case of the generalized problem has led to results on the existence and uniqueness of such convex bodies via the asymptotic behavior of a curvature flow. One of the key tasks is to refine this method for the aforementioned flows to solve a class of other, more difficult, cases.



There are also a number of other geometric questions in the project. They concentrate along two main directions: the study of new affine invariants of convex bodies and the question of finding sufficient conditions for two bounded convex domains in the Euclidean plane or space such that one domain contains a congruent copy of the other.



Despite their apparent diversity, our objectives have as a common thread the use of geometric evolution equations. A variety of techniques coming from PDE, convex and differential geometry are necessary to approach these topics, each in itself a challenging and important problem in the field.

"Our work this summer (still in progress) on Bilingual Call Centres has focused on bilingual call centre models  that allocate bilingual agents on the basis of the difference in  queue lengths. Upon completion of this step, we intend to study trilingual call centres to gain insight into good strategies for  the optimal allocation of inflexible (unilingual) and partially-flexible  (bilingual) agents, before using those who are trilingual. We then hope to apply insights gained from this aspect to allocation procedures for multilingual call centres.



Turning to organ transplant waitlists, demand  for organs from patients who could benefit exceeds the stable supply in almost all jurisdictions. For kidneys and livers, living-donor transplants are an option that is receiving increased attention to fill in the gap. Our work in this field has developed forecasts for the number of deceased donor organs vs. living donor organs required to achieve stability of the liver transplant queues in Canada. Future work will include a detailed simulation of waitlist operations, to more fully understand the impact of blood type, health level, time on list and other factors on time to transplantation. A theoretical priority queue model will be developed, to reflect increased urgency as a patient's health level decreases over time.  



Future work in the area of risk theory will pursue two fronts: applying fluid flow techniques to as yet unresolved aspects of perturbed risk processes such as the surplus prior to ruin, and initiating investigations of Gerber-Shiu functions for perturbed risk processes and those with a multi-layered structure. In Forestry, working with partners in provincial fire authorities (Ontario MNR) and national fire specialists (Canadian Forestry Service), we will study the fire spotting phenomenon, using infrared cameras, expert opinion elicitation, and other techniques.

"Hydrothermal alteration and weathering involve reactions between rocks, and hot and cold waters, respectively. These reactions are responsible for creating many mineral deposits which society exploits for their raw, mostly metallic, resources. The purpose of the proposed research is to develop new ways of investigating the chemical reactions responsible for the formation of mineral deposits, and to apply these techniques to rocks that have undergone these chemical reactions, in order to understand how these reactions have occurred. This will provide an important knowledge foundation that will allow geoscientists to improve mineral exploration success and facilitate mining efforts.

"Our program involves applying methods from homotopy theory to goemetric problems. One way to do this is by studying the complement M\P of a polyhedron P in a manifold M. An example of a manifold would be the possible positions of a mechanical system such as the planets in the solar system. The polyhedron would then correspond to unallowed positions, such as two planets being in the same location. The complement M\P would then correspond to allowable positions. We use algebraic invariants to give us information about this complement. In the case of a mechanical system, these invariants can control the behaviour of the system.

"Spurred by the growth of wireless networking, enabled by advanced in MEMS design, and inspired by robotic platforms like Spirit and Opportunity, heterogeneous sensor networks have moved to the forefront of many research agendas.  In heterogeneous sensor networks, the hardware of the nodes or motes is not uniform, and classified by power consumption, computational capacity and mobility.  Homogeneous networks achieve spatial resolution through high mote densities, while mobile heterogeneous sensor networks (MHSN) employ fewer more expensive mobile motes to reduce the node density of the network.

  While even a randomly deployed sensor network will generate more data than a single sensor, distributions which are based on the expected behavior of the area to be measured are more effective than distributions which are deployed blindly.  However, this raises a dilemma: how do you estimate the expected behavior of the system you are about to measure?  Presumably if detailed information on the system is available, there is no need for a sensor network to make measurements.  Recently, researchers have found that using statistical representations which estimate how one sensor's measurements correlate to one another; they can deploy nodes with more confidence.  This technique can be extended to a sequential deposition of sensors, building the sensor network piece by piece, or destination targets for mobile robots to rove from point to point, making measurements.

  This research proposal aims to add levels of sophistication to MHSN deployment strategies, which will allow the integration of physical models, the management of complex multivariate data and the inclusion of human experts in the measurement loop.  It will balance the additional implementation complexity against maintaining the statistical rigor of simpler techniques.  By adding physical models, multivariate representations and human experts, MHSNs can be developed into powerful tools for agricultural and environmental monitoring.","Heterogeneous sensor network deployment and monitoring for scaler fields",Agriculture,CANADA,CANADA,Robotics

"The study of magnetic field generation in planetary bodies provides vital information on planetary structure, dynamics and evolution.  Studying a planet's deep interior is challenging because we cannot observe the region directly.  Because magnetic fields are generated in a planet's core and extend beyond the surface where they are observable, magnetic fields can act as important probes of planetary interior structure and dynamics.  

     Many aspects of the magnetic field generation process (dynamo action) are not well understood.  This is because it is a very nonlinear, complex system with extreme control parameters.  Because magnetic fields are important in so many physical processes in the universe, such as the formation of stellar and planetary systems, the retention of planetary atmospheres and the protection of life on Earth from harmful solar radiation, it is crucial that we gain a better understanding of how they are generated.

    We use numerical simulations of the dynamo process in combination with observations of magnetic fields from spacecraft to study the magnetic field generation process inside planets.  In doing so, we learn about planetary interiors and evolution.  In this proposal we investigate the active dynamos in Earth, Mercury and Saturn, and the ancient dynamos in Mars and asteroids.  We also study the basic fluid dynamic processes inside planetary cores and develop improvements to dynamo models and computational methods. 

     We combine these investigations of planetary core dynamics with studies in planetary rotation and thermal evolution to obtain a more complete picture of planetary histories.

"With this grant we will purchase an Oroboros Oxygraph 2K that measures dissolved oxygen and ions. It will allow us to accurately measure rates of oxygen consumption of cells and mitochondria. Every animal cell contains mitochondria which consume oxygen while converting the products of ingested food into usable energy. Changes in the way mitochondria consume oxygen are important to many natural and pathological phenomena. For example, in hibernation a mammal's rate of oxygen consumption decreases by up to 90% as its body temperature falls close to freezing. Liver mitochondrial metabolism is decreased by 70% in hibernation and, using the Oxygraph, we will investigate how this occurs. These findings may improve treatment for traumatic injury and the viability of organs used for transplant.

   During a stroke blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain is interrupted. When blood flow is resumed there is burst of reactive oxygen species (""free radicals"") that can damage brain cells. We will use the Oxygraph to see what effect these conditions have on the metabolism and free radical production of brain cells and mitochondria. There is also evidence that brain mitochondrial function is impaired in autism spectrum disorders, and the Oxygraph will help us better understand this.

   Insulin resistance is associated with many serious conditions including diabetes and obesity. Insulin resistance seems to impair the ability of mitochondria to use fats as fuels. With the Oxygraph we will investigate what factors might lead to this impairment, and how it might be alleviated.

   Many birds migrate thousands of kilometres, often flying non-stop for days at a time. This incredible capacity for exercise depends on muscle mitochondria producing enormous amounts of energy while consuming a great deal of oxygen. The capacity for mitochondrial energy production may be affected by the high altitudes at which birds fly, and the polyunsaturated fats (such as omega-3's) in their diet. We will manipulate diets and simulate high altitudes and, using the Oxygraph, evaluate effects on flight muscle mitochondria.

"Genetically manipulated mice and quantitative real time polymerize chain (qRT-PCR) reaction analyses of the expression of the mRNA are important research tools and techniques for physiology research.  These tools are critical for understanding the physiological processes at the molecular level.  While these techniques and tools have been used for some time in biochemistry, biology and medicine, they are now being used in nutrition and kinesiology studies.  Modern equipment to support these activities such as thermal cyclers and spectrophotometers are essential to support research activities, but also to enable hands-on training for undergraduate students.  The amount of genetic and molecular based research as dramatically increased in Department of Kinesiology at the University of Waterloo largely as the result of the growth of new research programs.  This has resulted in the addition of two genetically modified mouse colonies with two more colonies being developed.  Maintenance of these colonies requires diligent genotyping.  In addition efforts to determine the impact of nutrition and exercise at the molecular level require extensive examinations of gene expression that includes the use of qRT-PCR).  Both genotyping and qRT-PCR require high capacity thermal cycling and spectrophotometry.  The use of these techniques in research programs in the field also creates a need and rationale for introducing related training at the undergraduate level.  The present equipment request will support the programs of three NSERC funded researchers and enable the undergraduate training in important molecular biology techniques.","Thermal cycler and nanodrop spectrophotometer","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Molecular genetics"
"Fatty acids have many structural and functional roles in biology in addition to being used as a source of energy. Many of these roles are attributed to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). In Western Societies, PUFA intakes are largely of the omega-6 class with low intakes of the omega-3 class. Most of the omega-3 intake is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3). Longer chain omega-3 fatty acids, namely eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) appear to influence many of these diverse cell functions.  DHA in particularly, is found in high concentrations in brain, retina and heart tissues.  EPA and DHA can be biosynthesized from ALA through a complicated series of steps.  

The rate biosynthesis is very low in humans.  However, DHA biosynthesis may be higher in women than in men, especially when dietary EPA and DHA intake is low. This is likely to ensure that during pregnancy an adequate amount of DHA is available for transfer from the mother to the fetus to support brain development.  Our research has demonstrated that omega-3 levels differ with menopausal status and that the retroconversion of DHA to EPA after DHA supplementation is attenuated in women taking oral hormone replacement therapy. We have also demonstrated that during pregnancy (when estrogen concentrations are high), DHA levels increase and EPA levels decrease.  

We hypothesize there are no sex differences in the absorption of omega-3 fatty acid from the diet and that the expression of enzymes involved PUFA metabolism and DHA synthesis (such as delta-6 destaurase and acyl-CoA oxidase) are increased ""in vivo"" in the presence of estrogen. We will use fatty acid stable isotopes to follow metabolism and quantify mRNA of enzymes such as delta-6 desaturase and acyl-CoA oxidase by real-time PCR in animal models.  Greater understanding of these basic mechanisms can provide the scientific basis for understanding health and disease and developing dietary recommendations and policies.

"Evidences of microbial population shifts in the mycorrhizosphere have been reported but the mechanisms regulating these changes and their impact on plant health are poorly known. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have coevolved in intimate relationship with land plants for at least 400 M yr and most plant species are adapted to the environment in close relationship with these fungal symbionts. AMF directly influence the plant nutrition metabolism and the release of photosynthates in the root environment, hence the microbial community living in the rhizosphere. AM fungi are key-factors in the rhizosphere and would contribute to make more complex and stable the rhizosphere microbial community, lowering the impact of soilborne plant pathogens. A better knowledge of microbial dynamics in AM systems will favor the use or manipulation of the AM symbiosis in horticulture and agrosystems, lowering the use of chemicals to control root diseases. The general goal of this research program is to understand how the AM fungi influence the rhizosphere microbial communities and lower the pathogenic pressure on host plants. Specific goals are : 1) To analyze the functional relationships between Fusarium, AM fungi and bacterial communities as related with plant health in the field; 2) To analyze the intraspecific and spatial variability in the AMF-Fusarium interaction in the AM rhizosphere in controlled soil microcosms; and 3) To characterize the physical interaction between hyphosphere bacteria and AMF mycelium, and the role of biofilm-forming communities in biocontrol. Various molecular, biochemical, microbiological and microscopical approaches will be used to test the effects of AM fungal and bacterial communities on Fusarium community structure and virulence. This research program will provide novel insight in the mechanisms leading to microbial competitive interactions in the mycorrhizosphere and to the lower disease development in mycorrhizal plants, significantly enhancing our capability to manage this symbiosis in a sustainable agricultural approach.

"Theoretical chemistry develops theories describing chemical processes and solves mathematical equations arising in these theories by using powerful computers. The goal of theoretical chemistry is to predict how substances behave without carrying out actual experiments. Because this approach does not require expensive laboratory equipment and in many cases gives the answer faster than experiment, it has become a major player in chemical and biological research, especially in designing new drugs and materials with valuable properties. As more and more scientists rely on computational chemistry to predict and understand properties of matter, demand for better theories and faster algorithms will continue to increase. This research program focuses on developing such tools and applying them to problems of modern chemistry.

"Systematics is the science that names, classifies and determines the evolutionary relationships of living things. Whether we are developing environmental policy, making conservation decisions, or studying the ecology or molecular biology of a species, systematics is essential because it defines the units (species, families, etc.) and provides the context (evolutionary relationships) for meaningful comparisons in biology. My research focuses on the systematics of the sedge family (Cyperaceae), a truly remarkable group of plants characterized by their exceptional diversity (ca. 5000 species), varied habitats (deserts to rain forests), unusual cytology (chromosome numbers from 12 to 112) and diverse biogeographical patterns. In the Flora of North America region (Canada & USA), sedges represent nearly 4% of our native flora (10% in Canada); they are common to every floral region, and they dominate vast areas of the continent in terms of diversity and biomass. Moreover, approximately 10% of sedges are of either direct (medicines, crops) or indirect (weeds) economic importance to humanity. Nevertheless, sedges remain a poorly studied group whose classification and relationships are highly unresolved. My long-term research objectives in the sedge family are to discover diversity, to clarify relationships, and to produce predictive classifications that can be used to preserve biodiversity and to advance our knowledge of sedge biology. In order to forward these long-term goals, I propose three short-term research objectives: (1) to define, circumscribe and determine the evolutionary relationships of the major groups within Cyperaceae and (2) tribe Cariceae, and (3) to produce a revised classification of Carex section Filifoliae. The wider impact of this research ranges from preserving biodiversity, to an improved understanding of world biogeography, C3/C4 photosynthesis and the evolution of chromosomal variation in sedges.","Systematics of cyperaceae","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Taxonomy, systematics and phylogenetics"
"Neuromuscular disorders change the structure and organization of the muscles involved and their complement of motor units (MUs). Characteristics of electromyographic (EMG) signals suitably detected from affected muscles can reflect the type and severity of disorder present. Proper interpretation of signal characteristics can assist with diagnosis, treatment and management. Currently, EMG signals are subjectively and qualitatively assessed for features consistent with nerve or muscle disease, chronicity, and severity. This assessment is subjective, and in part, highly dependent on the skill and experience of the examining physician and the extent to which progressive changes can be tracked is limited. Quantitative EMG (QEMG) analysis allows for a more objective, consistent and sensitive electrophysiological characterization. However, few applications capable of clinically acquiring QEMG data exist and more importantly a method for completing the crucial step of interpreting QEMG data to produce a characterization of the neuromuscular system is currently not available. The objectives of the proposed research are therefore to produce an integrated system for EMG signal acquisition, QEMG analysis and electrophysiological characterization for routine use in an EMG clinic. In addition, a comprehensive and intuitive rationale, and a valid measure of confidence will be provided for each characterization to support improved clinical decisions. Novel aspects of the new system will include: the integration of acquisition, analysis and interpretation; the ease and consistency of signal acquisition, the validity of the QEMG data provided; and the value of the electrophysiological characterization. Beyond facilitating the acquisition and quality of QEMG data, the main significance of this work will be improved interpretation of QEMG data which will contribute to better diagnosis, treatment and management of neuromuscular disorders. Furthermore, demonstrating an ability to readily complete these studies in an EMG clinic will increase the likelihood of the methods being translated to other clinical EMG machines for widespread impact.","Clinical characterization of muscle using quantitative electromyographic signal analysis","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)",CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical technology"
"Disorders of muscle and nerve change the structure and organization of the muscles involved.  Characteristics of clinical electromyographic (EMG) signals suitably detected from affected muscles reflect the degree and type of disorder present.  Physicians currently, subjectively and qualitatively, assess EMG signal characteristics to support diagnosis, treatment and management of specific disorders.  This assessment is highly dependent on physician skill and experience.  Furthermore, assessment of the severity of involvement and the sensitivity with which progressive changes can be tracked is limited.  Quantitative electromyography (QEMG) involves the detection and analysis of EMG signals to calculate statistics for neuromuscular characterization.  QEMG can improve the specificity and sensitivity of neuromuscular assessments and track longitudinal changes associated with specific treatment or management regimes.  However, a method for completing the crucial step of interpreting QEMG data to produce a neuromuscular characterization is currently needed.  

The current major objectives of our ongoing research program are as follows:

1.    )	To develop and evaluate methods that can assist in the interpretation of QEMG results.

2.    )	Introduce new quantitative statistics that more effectively reflect neuromuscular structure and physiology.

Based on clinically viable EMG signal decomposition systems that provide QEMG data that contain information regarding the structural, organizational and operational state of the muscles under study, novel statistically-based pattern discovery techniques for extracting the underlying information and facilitating the interpretation of QEMG results by creating a neuromuscular characterization will be developed and evaluated.  The characterizations will be presented in linguistic terms.  Their rationale will be easy to understand and their statistical basis will be able to be examined.  In addition, a valid measure of the confidence will be provided.

"The physiological and molecular events associated to plant embryo development  are difficult to study in vivo, due to the inaccessibility of the embryo.  The use of somatic embryogenesis, i.e. the generation of embryos in culture from asexual cells, opens new avenues for understanding the mechanisms controlling embryo development, especially during the early stages.  The proposed research program utilizes this strategy in canola (Brassica  napus) and white spruce (Picea glauca) to investigate two important aspects of embryogenesis: the role played by glutathione metabolism during embryo development in canola microspore-derived embryos and the identification of meristem genes in spruce somatic embryos.  Glutathione is a ubiquitous molecule which exists in two forms: a reduced form and an oxidized form.  This metabolite is involved in many cellular and developmental processes.  Recently we have demonstrated that a switch of the glutathione pool towards its oxidized state improves embryo development and apical meristem formation.  As an extension of this work we are interested in identifying genes regulated by glutathione during embryogenesis and in characterizing their function through transformation studies. Such work will be complemented by biochemical studies which will define the role of glutathione in relation to the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, which participate in the regulation of plant growth and development.  As meristem formation is a key event occurring during embryogenesis, we are also proposing to identify novel ARGONAUTE genes involved in the formation and maintenance of the embryonic apical poles.  Transformation studies will be employed to reveal how altered expression of these genes affect the architecture of the meristems. The role of these genes in the regulation of other meristem marker genes will be further investigated using laser capture microdissection techniques.  This research will elucidate important mechanisms regulating embryo development and will facilitate the design of novel tissue culture procedures to be used by the Canadian biotechnology industry dedicated to the in vitro propagation of plant species.

"The Building Aerodynamics Laboratory of Concordia University located at the Engineering complex, houses a large atmospheric boundary-layer wind tunnel (ABLWT), the only one of this type in Quï¿½bec and one of the very few in North America. It is an open circuit, blow down tunnel 12 meters long and has a test section 1.8 meters wide and 1.8 meters high. Models of buildings and their surroundings are constructed at a geometric scale (typically 1:500 to 1:200) and placed on a turntable downstream of the upcoming flow, which simulates the natural wind characteristics when wind blows towards from any direction. The ABLWT has been equipped with sensitive sensors and instruments used for accurate measurements of flow and pressure components depending on the particular application of interest. The facility has been used for numerous research studies with significant contributions in the field of wind engineering, mainly in the development of wind loading provisions for wind standards and building codes of practice around the world. Several hundreds of students, researchers, architects and engineers have been benefited by this facility during the past 25 years.

   The operation of the ABLWT requires a traversing gear system for the positioning of probes with their sensitive sensors. This tunnel had a home-made traversing system designed and installed by University personnel after the development of the wind tunnel. This system has been in operation for all that time but excessive use and wear resulted in its failure. In addition, the advances on the field of wind tunnel instrumentation increased the urgency for the acquisition of a more sophisticated, user friendly, high resolution and, most importantly, computer-based operated positioning system. Such systems are now commercially available and funds are requested by the present application to obtain a three-dimensional traversing gear system for the positioning of the probes. The need for this type of equipment is clear in order to continue the successful operation of this unique experimental facility of Concordia University for the accomplishment of the applicant's research program and the technological education of a large number of HQP.

"Designing and constructing buildings where people live and work is a complex process that depends on

specialized professionals (architects, engineers, and construction experts) being able to effectively manage and

share information. The design and construction process is currently inefficient because information is scattered

across physical locations, the process leading to decisions can be difficult to remember, and professionals have

substantial knowledge that is not written down for easy access by others. The proposed research will examine

how future collaborative computer systems can be designed to make it easier for construction professionals to

share information across both time and space.

The research project will involve developing and evaluating a series of prototypes that will integrate the diverse

sources of data involved in a construction project, make the data easily accessible to users through a visual

interface, and allow users to easily share and work collaboratively with information. Prototype development

will be intertwined with field studies that will examine collaborative work in practice for the design and

construction of a unique infrastructure project, the Center for Interactive Research on Sustainability.

The results of this research will be used to develop collaborative technology of benefit to many applications,

but the construction industry in particular. This technology will enable construction professionals to utilize

time in meetings more effectively and make better-informed decisions, leading to building designs that are

more constructable, maintainable, sustainable, and cost-effective.","ARTIFACT: Advanced Research, Techniques, and Informatics for Future Advantages in Construction Technology","Construction, urban and rural planning",CANADA,CANADA,"Virtual reality and related simulations"
"Building design is a complex process that requires numerous disciplines, each contributing a particular body of knowledge to the overall effort.  Multi-disciplinary coordination, therefore, is critical to the delivery of cost-effective, sustainable, and quality projects.  Recent advancements in Building Information Modeling (BIM) hold great promise for addressing coordination challenges by providing information models that serve as a reliable foundation for decision making and a platform for automated analysis.  Although significant advancements have been made in developing BIM design tools and exchanging BIM data, little work has focused on representing construction knowledge to support model-based design, and coordinating BIM models to support multi-disciplinary decision-making.  



The long-term objective of this research program is to gain a deeper understanding of the coordination process in the design and construction of building projects, and to apply that understanding to develop computer-based models specifically instrumented to support design and construction coordination.  Specific short-term objectives for this proposal focus on: (1) design coordination knowledge and tool development, (2) multi-user interactions with BIM data, and (3) formulation and evaluation of construction strategies.  This research provides a theoretical framework for encoding construction knowledge within a BIM development process, and for interacting with BIM data to support collaborative design.  



The results of this research will help project teams make more informed decisions, and better manage their process to meet constraints of time, budget, and quality. Computer-based support for these collaborative processes will have significant long-term impact, including more constructable, sustainable and cost-effective facilities.","Tools, techniques and workspaces for design and construction coordination","Construction, urban and rural planning",CANADA,CANADA,"Construction engineering and management"

We run large-scale computer programs to calculate what happens when free electrons and positrons scatter from atoms and molecules in a gas.  We work closely with experimental groups who are measuring these processes in order to understand the fundamental physics which they involve.  This helps us to develop better theoretical models to describe these collisions at the most detailed quantum mechanical levels possible and aids the experimentalists in interpreting their measurements.  We also use our data to help model an x-ray detector called a gas-proportional scintillation counter which is used in x-ray astonomy aboard satellites, for example.

"The control of life and death is as crucial as any question in biology. The survival and growth of cells are controlled by mechanisms that interpret signals from both inside and outside the cell to alter its activity.  Over recent years, the processes that control cell death have become very well understood.  More recently, the cellular functions that help cells live and grow are being recognised as interdependent.  In our laboratory, we study the common fruit fly, the genes of which are far more similar to humans than we once thought.  It is an ideal model organism to study this aspect of cell biology.

Before opening my lab, I demonstrated that extremely reduced levels of akt a target protein of the insulin receptor, result in cell death throughout the embryonic fruit fly.  Since then we have found that a target of akt, foxo, is key in the interpretation of low levels of insulin receptor signalling and acts to inhibit growth and alter metabolism in fruit flies. Most importantly, we have found that foxo may provide a limited survival mechanism during conditions of starvation when nutrients are unavailable.  Curiously, foxo may have an important role in sensing the availability of nutrition.  In addition, we are investigating other components of insulin receptor signalling including the Down Syndrome gene, minibrain, in flies.  In the future, we will identify additional targets of akt, minibrain and foxo and evaluate their roles in cell survival and growth.  

As cell death plays a role in degeneration of neurons, we investigate the cellular basis of protein induced neurodegeneration in flies.  We are studying the effect of the parkin and Pink1, two genes that are defective in some inherited forms of Parkinson disease, in the counteraction of cell death induced by toxic proteins.  By increasing the activity of these genes, we have been able to prevent these defects. We are striving to fully understand the biological effects of this process.

In summary, our research into the molecular cell biology of fruit flies provides a great opportunity to explore the mechanisms that control the delicate balance between life and death.

"Anthropogenic habitat modification is mainly responsible for the sharp rise in extinctions that characterizes the past century.  Reducing the rate of extinction requires that society reverse the reasons for population declines, which have frequently been associated with habitat loss and fragmentation, and conflict with humans.  My research program addresses these causes with two main objectives (1) identify the barriers and corridors to animal movement that determine the permeability to animals of fragmented landscapes and (2) address the human-wildlife conflict which sometimes results when wildlife are attracted to anthropogenic features in these landscapes.  I emphasize animal movement because it underlies several processes that are essential to the success of both individuals (e.g., finding food and mates) and populations (e.g., metapopulation dynamics).  Increasingly, I target situations of active human-wildlife conflict and attempt to find behavioural alternatives to lethal management of wildlife.  I aim to conduct innovative and rigorous projects that provide excellent science training for students while also providing tangible, defensible information for wildlife managers and landscape planners who are charged with maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.","Conservation behaviour in human-dominated landscapes",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Evolution and ecology"

"``Software must run closed loop.'' This statement from Robert Laddaga emerges from thinking about software agent evolution from conventional programs. Software agents require more monitoring and control because of their greater degree of autonomy, adaptation and mobility. The control of dynamic systems is a discipline that is born at the beginning of last century. Many solutions founded on powerful mathematical theories have been proposed for continuous systems and more recently for discrete event systems as programs or software agents. In the last case, the real impact is less significant, although several efforts have been made to elaborate a substantial theory called Supervisory Control Theory. Controlling programs during their execution implies, amongst other, solving fundamental problems related to their representation in a mathematical form. A natural way to represent a program is to use an automaton with a stack of unlimited size as well parameters that symbolize unbounded values. It results from this modelling pushdown systems and parameterized systems with infinitely many reachable states. Therefore, the control of infinite-state systems raises new important issues, which have been study very little in the past in the context of the Supervisory Control Theory, and constitutes the main subject of the present research program.

"Monitoring brittle fracture processes is important in a wide variety of geotechnical environments and materials. Reliability in the design and performance of rock and soil excavations, both surface and underground, has significant implications for society in terms of safety and economics. A portable brittle fracture monitoring facility will use the characteristics of acoustic emissions to aid in our understanding of failure mechanisms in both field and laboratory environments. The monitoring/characterization  of rock slope instability and associated brittle fracture/damage mechanisms will be undertaken at varying scales including highway cuts, quarries, surface mines and large open pits (up to a km in depth).  The portable brittle fracture monitoring instrumentation system will be used underground to monitor pillar, roof and floor performance and the development of progressive damage in a range of mine environments. Fundamental studies on the brittle fracture monitoring of materials both in the laboratory and in the field will also be highly relevant to rock mechanics studies associated with natural hazards (landslides, subsidence, vulcanicity, earthquakes) and resource geotechncs. The portable brittle fracture monitoring equipment will be incorporated into existing LiDAR, ground based InSAR, photogrammetry, survey and geophysical instrumentation in order to form an integrated multi-component brittle fracture/rock mass characterization facility.

"Due to the explosion of computational advances and general technological innovation for gathering information, modern scientific research faces a unique challenge when faced with missing data. My research will attempt to develop new methods for analyzing data in the presence of missing observations, particularly for data that is high-dimensional in nature and addressing the question of model selection. I will employ and extend advanced nonparametric clustering methods to improve multiple imputation methods for high-dimensional categorical variables.I will show how returning the the original premise of the multiple imputation algorithm as estimation of a high-dimensional integral can help to improve the efficiency of inference with small numbers of copies through the use of adaptive quadrature methods, particularly methods that have been developed for the design of computer experiments. I will examine the use of tools for dimensionality reduction that are commonly used in machine and statistical learning (such as principal component analysis, partial least squares, neural networks, and support vector machines) to allow for generation of completed datasets that use as much relevant information as possible and practical. Finally, I will use new developments in functional data analysis (particularly generalized profile estimation) to construct a framework in which practitioners can more easily and automatically test for robustness to modelling assumptions when analyzing data with missingness.

"Finding ways to effect the efficient conversion of solar to electrical energy is crucial to society's future well-being. Photovoltaic solar cells do make this energy conversion, but the present ones based on inorganic semiconductor materials are too expensive for widespread use and often contain environmentally sensitive elements. On the other hand the present organic dye-sensitized solar cells are cheaper to make and present no significant environmental hazard, but are relatively inefficient and have a short working lifespan. The applicants wish to make use of their recent discoveries in the area of non-coherent photon upconversion to improve both the efficiency and longevity of organic photovoltaic solar cells. Efficiency will be improved by employing photon upconversion in the near infrared portion of the solar spectrum - a process that pools most of the energy of two photons to effect a high-energy electron transfer process. Longevity will be improved by using materials such as fullerenes that are much more photostable than the organic dyes presently employed. The applicants have discovered the true mechanism of non-coherent photon upconversion and now wish to make use of this information to design, construct and test organic solar photovoltaic cells based on this process. The equipment requested will enable them to follow the rates of production and consumption of key intermediate species in the photon upconversion process using transient absorption and delayed fluorescence techniques. This information is essential if the above improvements are to be achieved (by the applicants).","Essential equipment for temporal characterization of transients in solar photon upconversion systems","Energy storage and conversion",CANADA,CANADA,"Physical chemistry"
"    )	Chemical and physical processes initiated by light are central to life on earth. Early scientific studies of natural light-driven processes such as photosynthesis and vision led curious minds inevitably to ask the most fundamental questions about these phenomena. ""What is the nature of light?"" ""How does light interact with material substances and with what consequence?"" The answers have provided the basis for new technologies, improvements in health, and wealth creation beyond the first questioners' wildest imaginations: xerography, fibre optic communications, optical data storage, artificial methods for the capture and storage of solar energy, photochemical methods of wastewater treatment, photodynamic therapy for some types of cancer and for macular degeneration. Whole industries are presently based on the generation of laser light and its use in photonics devices, micromachining and a host of other applications. More is on the horizon; light-driven molecular logic devices, optical quantum computing, coherent control of photochemical and photophysical processes, and numerous other applications are under active investigation. In our research group we continue to address fundamental questions about the chemical and physical effects of the absorption of light by matter, and the information we obtain continues to find application in these and other important areas.

    )	Our specific aims are to examine the structure and dynamic behaviour of molecules in highly excited electronic states. Fundamental research that we did 15 years ago now finds application in designing and fabricating light-harvesting polymers. Work that we have done more recently shows how molecules of interest to us could be incorporated as switches and logic gates into light-driven molecular electronics devices.

"This proposal is for computerised equipment to control a hydraulic mechanical testing machine.  This machine is used to run compression, tension and bending experiments, as well as long-duration experiments to probe the fatigue endurance of materials and structures.  The focus in this laboratory is performing experiments on ultralightweight materials and structures which can be used as components in aircraft.  Reducing weight is increasingly important to aircraft design because lighter aircraft require less fuel and smaller engines, reducing both cost and environmental impacts.  Consequently it would be of great benefit to Canada to be a leader in the field of lightweight aircraft design, both because of the environmental benefits and because of the international competitive advantage it would bring to our aerospace industry.



The materials and structures being developed in this lab use microarchitectured materials and multifunctionality to improve efficiency and performance.  For example, this can be accomplished by making materials which have internal truss-type structural systems.  In such a case, further functionality can be added by replacing some of the microtrusses with actuators; this enables shape-changing structures.  However, because of the complexity of these materials it is much more difficult to predict how they will behave in service.  The experiments performed in this laboratory help provide aircraft designers with models and design tools they can use to build lighter aircraft.  However, the current controller for the test machine is 25 years old, not computerised, and failing intermittently with high repair costs; replacement parts are unavailable.  Without replacement, the experiments needed to support this research and development are impossible.  As a consequence, this proposal is requesting funds to replace the old controller with modern equipment so that this research program can continue.

"The long-term goal of this program is to create new concepts for multifunctional aerospace structures which improve the performance and efficiency of transportation vehicles, using analytical modeling supported by experimental validation and finite element simulation.  To achieve these goals, weight efficient structures are to be combined with advanced functional elements to produce integrated packages which provide, in a single component, both structural strength and stiffness and other capabilities such as cooling, energy harvest or shape adaptation.  Key challenges are the creation of ultra lightweight structural systems which are amenable to the insertion of functional systems; and the identification and analysis of the physical phenomena relevant to the operation of a multifunctional system.



The research proposed here addresses the first of these challenges.  Sandwich-type structures have already been identified as suitable for multifunctional applications because of the space available in the low density core.  However, microarchitectured core materials are a relatively recent development, and hence systematic approaches to optimising these structures for minimum weight or for other design goals are underdeveloped.  Additionally, there are new techniques for improving the performance of the core materials while reducing mass, such as composite pin-reinforcement or functional grading.  This stage of the project will develop and validate the models needed for successful optimisation of sandwich structures using advanced materials in order to provide a structurally efficient foundation for enhanced functionality.  The program will then directly address multifunctional applications of advanced sandwich structures configured as acoustic panels.  The ultimate products of this program will include technologically advanced aerospace components, providing greater competitiveness to the Canadian aerospace industry, and a cohort of highly skilled graduates proficient in multifunctional aerospace design.

"The ability to recognize the identity and emotional expression of a human face is of critical importance in our daily lives. It is therefore not surprising that we are such experts at this ability and further, that specific regions within the brain appear to be devoted to face processing. Although it is clear that certain structures in the brain are related to face processing, there has been considerable debate in the scientific literature, about the precise roles of the brain regions that are involved. My research program examines the functional roles of the various structures in the brain that are thought to play a role in face processing and indeed which side (if any) of the brain plays a dominant role. This research program uses both behavioural and neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to investigate the underlying representations used by these structures. I will use fMRI adaptation to measure the selectivity of face processing regions for visual attributes. My research program consists of three main projects, which broadly ask the following questions: 1) Are there gender differences in ability to recognize faces and is this reflected in differences in cortical activation for faces in one hemisphere compared to the other? 2) Does a concurrent manual task that is processed by the right hemisphere interfere with face processing more than one that is processed by the left hemisphere? 3) Does losing the left eye early in life (from which the right hemisphere primarily receives its input) affect face processing and cortical activation for faces more than losing the right eye early in life? In addition to answering fundamental questions about the roles of specific brain structures for face processing the findings from this research program will have implications for the clinical evaluation and treatment of neurological deficits that result from damage to these areas of the brain.","Behavioural and neuroimaging studies of face processing",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Sensory systems -- visual"

"Functional magnetic resonance imaging has greatly enhanced our understanding of how human brain processes information. In particular, while it is well established that brain activity is associated with local changes in brain blood flow that MRI can detect, the mechanism that links brain activity to blood flow is not well understood. Since blood flow adjustments in response to brain activity changes are critical for healthy brain function, different aspects of this coupling have become the focus of many recent studies. However, there are still very little data available on this topic in the live mammalian brain, the model most pertinent to our understanding of human brain function. In the proposed research, we will perform detailed microscopic imaging in live transgenic mice, as to further our understanding of the cellular processes that underlie the link between blood circulation and activity in the brain. In addition, this research will enhance the experimental tools and methodologies for the study of brain function in live mammals and aid in the interpretation of brain activation patterns observed in humans via functional MRI.","In vivo imaging of neurovascular coupling","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,Neurophysiology

"Previous research by the applicant on the energetics of vertical jumping, running and sprinting indicated that lower extremity joints such as the ankle, knee and hip often work like rotational springs. In fact, joints such as the ankle can be replaced entirely by passive mechanical springs and still result in highly successful performances in activities such as running and sprinting. For example, Oscar Pistorius holds the world record in the mens 100m sprint for double amputees at 10.91s! Thus, the concept of energy storage and return at these joints during various movements is highly relevant. However, the question remains whether or not supplementing the stiffness of currently intact and functional joints can influence performance. It may be possible to use elastic elements placed in apparel to aid the muscles in performing particular movements. In fact, some of our initial studies with elastic structures placed at the hip in athletic suits have resulted in better performance and have been used in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

     Although we have found that we can increase athletic performance with elastic and compressive garments, many questions remain. How much energy can be stored and returned with elastic garments? What about placing elastic elements at the knee joint or the ankle joint? Can we improve walking efficiency of individuals who locomote at the limits of their energy supply? 

     We hypothesize that substantial performance improvements can be achieved with elastic elements at the knee and ankle joint due to well defined stretch-shortening cycles. Furthermore, if performance improvements can be achieved in elite athletes that are already highly trained and optimized for running and sprinting activities, it is speculated that even greater efficiency improvements can be obtained in an untrained general population allowing individuals to accomplish tasks that they may have been unable to do before. Our overall goal is to develop a research program investigating elastic apparel that aids human locomotion and athletic performance.

"Until recently, an average computer programmer could exploit the increasing hundreds of millions of transistors available on integrated circuit chips without any extra effort, since they were each organized as a single processor. However, technology limitations have recently forced industry to switch to multicore processors: parallel processors within a chip.  To fully exploit this parallelism requires that all programs be transformed using skills which average programmers do not have---a significant challenge for the Canadian software industry.



The goal of this project is to ease the extraction of parallelism from sequential programs so that non-expert programmers can exploit multicores. Methods for speculative parallelization such as Thread-Level Speculation (TLS) and Transactional Memory (TM) have been shown to be a promising way of easing the parallelization of sequential programs, but typically involve novel hardware support that does not yet exist.  In this project we will support speculative parallelization for C programs, through a systems based entirely in software.  Our approach will be to leverage compiler analyses and optimizations to reduce overheads and customize these two key mechanisms to match the behaviour of applications.

"Current decisions concerning water allocation from rivers are constrained by the requirement of maintaining a viable ecosystem in the river or stream. The current practice is to use physical habitat as a surrogate for ecology based on the assumption that if the physical conditions are similar to those used by existing aquatic populations then the ecology will be maintained. Reliable hydrodynamic modeling tools are required to predict detailed depth, velocity and temperature distributions as a function of the stream discharge and geometry. 

     The research proposed in this Discovery Grant application will be comprised of three specific projects that will lead to significant improvements in aquatic ecology modeling. The first project is the development of a new approach to the hydrodynamic component of the modeling whereby models of different dimensional resolution are coupled and solved simultaneously. An example is using a one-dimensional (longitudinal) model for the majority of the length of a river but with an expanded two-dimensional (horizontal plane) model at a few selected sites. Similarly, the two-dimensional model may also contain regions which are modeled in all three dimensions. The second project concerns near surface groundwater flow that enters and leaves the alluvial substrate of the channel due to water surface variations and channel bathymetry. As flow within the substrate is much slower than on the surface, the water may have significantly different properties (e.g. temperature and dissolved oxygen) when it returns to the stream. This is important for fish spawning and incubation. The third research project is a contribution toward an entirelynew approach that models the ecologyof the stream by attempting to directlypredict the spatial distribution of species populations. This research will be in collaboration with biologists and mathematicians who will develop the governing partial differential equations. These equations are similar in form to the hydrodynamic equations and our research will be to adapt and/or develop effective and efficient numerical solution methods. This research has the potential to change the way we understand aquatic ecosystems and provide reasonable instream flow recommendations.

"The proposed research program is focused on fundamental molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of Major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) genes and the intracellular transport of MHC-II molecules. MHC-II molecules serve as antigen presenting molecules for CD4-positive T cells, which play a central role for the adaptive immune response, since they modulate most of the immune reactions, such as activation of B cell, macrophages and CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells. Both MHC-II genes and molecules are subject to multiple levels of control, which are essential for the correct function of the immune response and thus present a very interesting and relevant model system for the study of multi-layered regulatory circuits.

MARCH protein ubiquitin ligases have emerged as a novel class of immunomodulators that are still poorly understood. We have shown recently that MARCH1 is essential for the IL-10-induced down-regulation of MHC-II molecules expression in monocytes. One of our main interests for the future will be to study the molecular mechanisms of modulation of MHC-II molecule intracellular transport by MARCH proteins. Very little is known about the regulation of MARCH genes and we will study their regulation in different cell types and after exposure to various stimuli. We will also study the function of different isoforms generated by alternative promoters. 

The majority of positive and negative regulatory mechanisms of MHC-II genes expression are orchestrated directly or indirectly by the MHC-II transactivator CIITA. We have found recently that the extreme N-terminal end of CIITA is both necessary for degradation and transcriptional activation. CIITA is a large non-DNA-binding transcriptional activator and its mode of action is only partially understood. We propose to carry out detailed analysis of its central GTP binding domain, which is important for subcellular transport and transactivation. We also propose to identify proteins interacting with CIITA via a novel genetic approach.

"The microbial nitrogen cycle evolved early on Earth to provide usable forms of nitrogen to all of life. However, massive human inputs of nitrogen from agriculture and industry have severely altered the balance of the nitrogen cycle. Rather than returning unassimilated nitrogen to the atmosphere as inert dinitrogen, some N-cycling microorganisms favorably produce and release reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) like nitrite, nitrate, nitric oxide and nitrous oxide as a function of increased N-loading. RNI have significant negative effects on the environment including eutrophication of surface water, destruction of stratospheric ozone, and global warming. The proposed research focuses on the microbial production of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that is ca. 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide in global warming potential. In anaerobic metabolism, i.e. denitrification, nitrous oxide is readily consumed to produce dinitrogen as a terminal product. In contrast, the aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria produce and release nitrous oxide as a terminal product when N-loads are high and oxygen concentrations are low. For instance, ammonia-oxidizers are significant global producers of nitrous oxide in agricultural soils and water bodies impacted by agricultural runoff. Interestingly, the genes and pathways for nitrous oxide production by ammonia-oxidizers remain largely uncharacterized, and nearly all of what we know is from work with a single ammonia-oxidizing isolate. Based on our vital need to further understand the workings of, and our continued impact on the microbial nitrogen cycle, objectives of the proposed research are to: 1) broadly identify and characterize microbial genes for RNI production and metabolism, 2) determine the physiological role of RNI metabolism genes in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, and 3) detect the presence and expression levels of genes from ammonia oxidizers in environmental samples. This multifaceted approach from the bioinformatics, to the organism, to the environmental scales will further our understanding of the microbial nitrogen cycle, pathways for RNI production and metabolism, and sources of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere.

"During infection of the human host Helicobacter pylori uses a type IV secretion system (T4SS), to secrete the CagA cytotoxin from the bacteria directly into the epithelial cells of the stomach.  This process is implicated in the development of several gastric diseases and requires 18 putative T4SS components, which are all encoded in a specialized region of the Helicobacter pylori chromosome (cag-region).  Eight of these Cag-proteins share sequence-homologies with components of the T4SS encoded by various other bacteria.  The remaining 10 proteins involved in CagA secretion are unique for Helicobacter pylori and do not show similarity to any known proteins in databases.  The objectives of this proposal are to use genetic, molecular biology, and biochemical techniques to investigate the macromolecular structure of the T4SS.  We will investigate, which Cag-proteins interact with each other to form the secretion apparatus and which conformational changes of the Cag-proteins are induced by the three energetic components of the system to allow substrate secretion.  Our research will lead to a better understanding of the mechanistic similarities and differences between the family of T4SS in general and of the structure of the T4SS of Helicobacter pylori specifically.","Analysis of the macromolecular structure of the type IV secretion system of helicobacter pylori","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,Microbiology
"Humans have excellent vision in part because we have eyes that can move. This research is directed at understanding how the brain stays informed about which way the eyes are pointing. This information about eye position is important because we need to know it in order to move around in our world. The particular kind of information we are studying is that coming back to the brain from the eye muscles - called proprioception.  As an example of this sense, proprioceptive information from your arm and neck muscles allows you to touch your nose with your eyes closed. We think that there are proprioceptive signals from the eye muscles keeping us informed about eye position.  We study this in people who are having their eye muscles operated on to correct a misalignment of the eyes called strabismus (sometimes called ""wall-eyed"" or ""cross-eyed""). We carefully measure their eye movements before and after this surgery, using television cameras and computers. The changes in the way they move their eyes, or in the way the brain responds to the changes in eye position produced by the surgery, tells us how much of this proprioceptive information is being used. The information we obtain will help us make better diagnoses in those people with strabismus and may even help us to increase the chances that the surgical correction will produce excellent results every time.

"We are trying to build a system to interface light and atoms at the quantum level.  Quantum information processing promises capabilities beyond anything possible with current technology (absolutely unbreakable cryptographic systems, exponentially faster computation of certain algorithms, et cetera), but will require the invention of new techniques to realize.  Already, quantum light (single photons) is used in commercial prototypes for secure communication, but turning such systems into computational devices will require some sort of ""photon switch,"" since left to their own devices, one beam of light will placidly pass through another without any kind of interaction which could be used to compute.  One of the most promising avenues for such technologies involves the use of atoms, which interact strongly with light.  The problem is that so far, the interactions observed have been billions of times too weak to let individual quantum particles of light (photons) switch one another.  Recent proposals suggest that it may be possible to close this gap, but this involves specially designed sources of light and carefully controlled laser-cooled atoms.  We are fortunate in our lab to already have a ""Bose-Einstein condensate"" of Rubidium atoms (cooled to well below a millionth of a degree above absolute zero), and a novel source of quantum-entangled light we have developed specifically for interactions with Rubidium.  This proposal will allow us to acquire two essential pieces of equipment for trapping and manipulating the atoms in the careful manner required for use in quantum logic, and for generating and tailoring the specific beams of light which are predicted to enhance the desired interaction.  This is a highly competitive area of research internationally, but we are in an excellent starting position, and if we succeed, this unique capability will open new doors in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and particularly for quantum information processing.

"Finite state automata are a fundamental model of computation in theoretical computer science.  They are used both as machines to recognize regular languages, and as machines to transform input strings into output strings. They also play a key role in compilers of computing languages.  In addition, automata form a basic building block for more complicated models of computation.  Automata theory has also found many applications in pure mathematics.  Applications can be found in such diverse areas of mathematics as: group theory, semigroup theory, symbolic dynamics and holomorphic dynamics.



I propose to explore several aspects of the theory of automata.  The first aspect is Krohn-Rhodes theory, which concerns decomposing automata into their simplest possible parts.  Krohn-Rhodes complexity measures the number of group parts needed in such a decomposition and I am looking for a way to compute this.



Groups whose elements consist of automata have recently played a role in the theory of self-similar groups and their relationship with fractals.  This proposal also suggests doing some work in this direction.  Such groups may also lead to a way to generate new expander graphs, which have applications in telecommunication networks.



Algorithmic problems concerning formal languages plays a major role in automata theory, especially in computer science applications.   A typical question is of the sort:  given a class of formal languages and given an operator on formal languages, does the class resulting from applying this operator still have decidable membership?  There are also questions related to logical description of languages and hierarchies of regular languages.

"Canadian society is experiencing an epidemic of obesity that is contributing to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and premature death. It has been known for many years that exercise can prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease however the molecular events mediating this effect are not known.     Recent associative evidence has suggested that a potential mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise may be the AMP-activated protein kinase signalling pathway.    In the current study we intend to investigate the effects of exercise on fat metabolism in mice with deficient AMPK signalling to determine whether this is the critical enzyme responsible for the beneficial effects of exercise.     A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating the beneficial effects of exercise may lead to the design of new therapeutics for the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

"Supply Chain Scheduling and Due Date Assignment



A supply chain may cover all stages of a system at which value is added to a product, including the supply of raw materials and intermediate components, finished-goods manufacture, packaging, warehousing, transportation and logistics.  Decisions made by decision-makers at different stages of the supply chain may result in substantial inefficiencies if poorly coordinated.   Supply Chain Scheduling includes the coordination of scheduling, batching and delivery decisions at different parts of the supply chain to eliminate those inefficiencies.  Its typical objective is to minimize the overall scheduling and distribution costs.

Meeting due dates has always been one of the most important objectives in scheduling.  While traditional scheduling models considered due dates as given by exogenous decisions, in a more flexible and integrated system, they are assigned by taking into account the system's ability to meet the quoted delivery dates.  Including due date assignment with appropriate costs in supply chain scheduling  can work as an additional coordinating mechanism between the possibly competing objectives of suppliers, manufacturers and customers.



The proposed research represents the continuation of our work to develop  efficient new algorithms for finding optimal or near-optimal schedules for supply chain scheduling problems.  We want to extend this work to investigate additional scheduling objectives and multi-level supply chains.  The inclusion of due date assignment as a coordinating mechanism in supply chain scheduling represents an entirely new concept.  We hope that the additional flexibility of assignable due dates will allow us to find new, efficient and practical solutions for the underlying supply chain scheduling problems.  This could lead to better coordination of supply chains, the more effective use of resources and higher levels of productivity.

"Statistical methods are well established tools for improving the quality and productivity of manufacturing processes and products.  As industries, technology and competitive forces evolve, new problems and challenges arise that require new methods.  The main thrust of the proposed research is the development and enhancement of a step by step algorithm to guide practitioners through a variation reduction project.  Reducing the variation in process outputs is a key part of process improvement.  For mass produced components and assemblies, reducing variation can simultaneously reduce overall cost, improve function and increase customer satisfaction with the product.  Excess variation can have dire consequences, leading to scrap and rework, the need for added inspection, customer returns, impairment of function and a reduction in reliability and durability.

"Ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have become indispensable clinical tools for diagnosing diseases without having to open up or irradiate the body.  Still, it is often difficult for doctors to interpret the resulting images, especially when there are complex structures, tissue motion or blood flow.



Computer simulations of medical imaging have played an important role in the development and optimization of US and MRI, because the truth behind a ""virtual patient"" is well-defined.  Unfortunately, many simulations are restricted to simple virtual patients (composed of cubes, spheres, etc.), and often different researchers will unknowingly reinvent the same simulation tools.



Over the years my students and I have developed rudimentary US and MRI simulation tools, based on the same techniques we use to simulate blood flow for our research into vascular disease. In this proposal, I describe how we will now extend these to simulate medical imaging processes more efficiently and realistically.



Important design criteria for us will be: (i) that these tools operate on anatomically realistic, three-dimensional virtual patients, so that conclusions drawn from them are more likely to work when applied in the clinic; and (ii) that they be made freely available to the research community through the same kind of open source software licenses that have driven the success of the Linux operating system. 



Making these tools widely available will allow researchers to focus on solving problems without having to be distracted by creating their own simulators first.  Ultimately, of course, these simulators will play an important role in improving the quality of medical imaging, and hence the diagnosis and treatment of patients.

In order to further the work and allow the development of applications in the synthesis of desirable products the assessment of performance of prospective catalyst is essential. Thus, the Catalyst Assessment System comprised of GC-MS and chiral HPLC is absolutely essential to this work. These instruments will be used by over 20 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows on a daily basis. These techniques are standard in most laboratories and yet we do not such facilities placing us at a serious competitive disadvantage.

"Hydrogenation, or the addition of hydrogen to molecules is one of the most important transformations in all of chemistry. Typically this process requires the use of a transition metal to mediate this process. We have discovered a new metal-free process that effects the hydrogenation of a variety of organic molecules. This new technology offer a greener, lower cost method for the production of a wide range of desirable organic compounds. In this proposal we target the optimization of our technology for the commercial production of organic-nitrogen based compounds. The technology has been patented and licensed to PARTEQ Innovations who will work with us to continue to protect and broaden the IP, market the technology to endusers and assist in subsequent the start-up and scale-up phases.

"The prospect of a future based on a hydrogen economy requires new technologies for the efficient generation, storage and utilization of hydrogen. Current approaches suffer from either the lack of technology for the regeneration of the hydrogenated material or only efficiently store hydrogen at low temperatures. In recent work, we have made a breakthrough discovery involving the activation of hydrogen. We have described the first metal-free molecular system capable of the reversible activation of hydrogen. While our discovery is fundamental in nature, the work points to a conceptually new path to hydrogen storage materials. We plan a three phased approach that probes new classes of molecular materials that incorporate both Lewis acidic and Lewis basic sites. Initially we will develop new systems in which Lewis acid and Lewis base centers are held

apart by non-covalent hydrogen bonding interactions. A second strategy will target covalent systems that restrict the approach of Lewis acidic and basic sites. The ability of each of these systems to reversibly bind hydrogen will be examined. Moreover, the development of such materials with polar cavities prompts questions regarding the ability of such systems to incorporate molecular hydrogen via interactions with the inherent dipole of the cavity. Thus, in these first two phases of the program, we will target a full understanding of the relationship between the nature of the Lewis acid/bas pairing in these materials and their ability to either activate or bind molecular hydrogen. These data will then culminate in the design and construction of new

""hybrid"" 3D materials that incorporate capabilities for both chemical storage and inclusion of hydrogen. Optimization of the molecular units required for construction of such materials will be essential in order to maximize the capacity for hydrogen storage by weight percent. In summary, we exploit expertise in disparate areas including supermolecular, materials, main group and theoretical chemistry to address the issue of hydrogen storage. Based on a new fundamental finding, we offer a new ""hybrid"" approach that exploits both reversible hydrogen activation and inclusion to develop important new materials.","Frustrated Lewis pairs in hydrogen storage materials: A new paradigm","Energy storage and conversion",CANADA,CANADA,"Inorganic nonmetal chemistry"

"The production of the bulk of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and materials used today involve some form of catalysis. Most often, such processes require the use of precious metals which adds significant cost to the resulting product. In addition, these metals generate issues relating to toxicity necessitating removal from products for human consumption (pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs). During the course of our NSERC discovery grant research, we have made a breakthrough discovery that is changing the way chemists think about catalysis. Our initial work in this area was reported in Science, 2006 and described the first metal-free system capable of activating and releasing hydrogen. This finding has since become the basis for the development of new, metal-free approaches to catalytic hydrogenation, a process that is ubiquitous in chemical production. Moreover, this discovery points the way to metal-free reactions of other common chemical precursors.  

In this proposal we target the further development of this new technology targeting a broadening range of application for metal-free hydrogenations. System modifications for applications in the production of high purity drugs and medicines are also to be studied. Extension of the fundamental concept upon which this breakthrough is based will be explored. Here we plan to both garner a deeper understanding of this new paradigm of reactivity as well as expand the range of reactivity and utility of our metal-free approach to small molecule reactivity. In this fashion, we hope to uncover fundamentally new yet lower cost, environmentally friendly processes for chemical production. Such developments could impact directly on processes used in the production of refined oil, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals.

"Diseases that arise from animals affect human security by causing disease, insecure food supplies, economic

instability or reduced ecological integrity. New patterns of disease are emerging as free-ranging wildlife

become increasingly involved in the epidemiology of diseases of people and livestock. As the interface

between wildlife, agriculture and people continues to grow, there will be new demands for early detection of

wildlife diseases. To meet these demands new methods will need to be developed and new evidence will be

required to ensure these methods are employed in the most effective and efficient manner. Unfortunately,

significant uncertainty exists regarding the ability to identify and detect disease in wildlife due to limitations in

study design and sampling methods. Our goal is to adapt methods from public health, bioterrorism

preparedness, and environmental monitoring to the reality of tracking disease in free-ranging wildlife in order

to develop innovative and reliable tools to meet Canadian and international goals for wildlife disease

surveillance as a component of disease early warning systems. We will ask 2 questions: (i) How do we

increase the odds of finding cases of disease in wildlife that is free to roam throughout the wilderness and (ii)

once we know where to look for a case, how can we be assured we will find it quick enough to prevent the

spread of the disease? Using historic reports of diseases in wild northern bison we will develop decision tools

for disease managers that will allow them to focus their early warning surveillance. We will see if features of

herd health status, the herd's ecology or landscape ecology can forecast where diseases are more likely to be

found, particularly the early cases of an outbreak. Bison are affected by a number of diseases that threaten

public health, agriculture and conservation and thus serve as a good research subject. Their diseases occur as

sporadic cases and as outbreaks and have been studied for many years; providing us with enough data to allow

this study to take place. The final results will be examined for their practical application by detailed evaluation

by disease managers before final recommendations are made on how to improve early detection.

"The aim of this project is to find efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems.   These problems arise in both theoretical and applied settings.  The most famous problem of this type is the Travelling Salesman Problem, but many combinatorial optimization problems are linked through beautiful theory and common ideas.  Combinatorial optimization problems are characterized by having a discrete search space.  The challenge is that this space is nevertheless too large to enumerate completely, even with very fast computers, so intelligent algorithms and heuristics are required.  Our aim is to find and analyze such algorithms.



This proposal focuses on four particular combinatorial questions.  They are:



1. Finding algorithms for the colourful linear programming feasibility problem.



2. Studying algorithms for generating monotone boolean functions and applying these algorithms to understanding metabolic networks.



3. Using a distributional approach to analyze combinatorial objective functions defined on groups.



4. Proving the Grone-Merris conjecture on the spectrum of graphs.



Besides their immediate application, progress on these nice problems will help to illuminate key issues in optimization.

"My main research objective, is to propose an efficient iterative estimation module for the wireless channel coefficients and associated parameters (SNR, maximum Doppler shift, time and frequency offsets, angular spread, K-factor associated with the line-of-sight (LOS) , LOS Doppler shift,...) in future high data speed cellular networks. I will focus my efforts on wideband systems that use OFDM, even if many of the developed estimation algorithms are expected to be applicable, in addition, to systems for which a narrowband channel assumption is appropriate. While most studies focus on specific parameters while using simplifying assumptions for other parameters, our ultimate goals will be to develop a full estimation module capable of estimating the channel and its parameters under practical conditions. The estimators will therefore have to perform adequately with non-constant envelope modulation and with colored interference scenarios. The developed module will rely on the presence of pilot symbols, and various pilot allocation and signaling strategies will be evaluated, which will need to be tailored to the type of multi-access (OFDMA, TDMA and hybrid versions will be studied), smart antenna (beamforming, spatial multiplexing, etc) and link adaptation strategies. Both time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD) will be considered, and possible uplink/downlink channel symmetry exploited. Recursive or turbo-like approaches will be studied to obtain a global estimation module of relatively low complexity. Furthermore, since we observe a proliferation of GPS-enabled cellular terminals, I will investigate the possibility of enhancing the channel parameters estimation process by exploiting the possible knowledge (with the appropriate signaling) of the position/speed/trajectory of the various transmitters/receivers. The algorithmic designs will first be based on the link-level performance, but will be fine-tuned based on a multi-user multi-cellular system-level performance evaluations conducted on a simulator that will need to be constructed with appropriate simplifying assumptions. Implementation aspects will also be considered.

"Sleep problems and disorders afflict over half of the adult population in the Western world, including Canada, with huge costs for individuals and society as a whole. Inadequate sleep has been linked to a wide variety of adverse consequences to health and quality of life. Despite this, research has thus far failed to provide a definitive answer to some very basic and important questions, including ""how much sleep do we need?"", ""can we adapt to less sleep?"", ""what are the physiological mechanisms mediating the consequences of chronic sleep debt?"" The proposed research is intended to work toward an answer to these questions.

Most individuals that suffer from sleep problems experience ongoing fragmentation and/or insufficiency of sleep (chronic sleep restriction) rather than total sleep deprivation. Published research indicates that chronic sleep restriction has significant effects on human neurobehavioural performance and mental health. However, little attention has yet been given to the physiological consequences of chronic sleep restriction, in humans or animals, despite the known link between sleep problems and physical health (e.g. cardiovascular disease, obesity, Type 2 diabetes and suppressed immune responses). Hence, the main goal of the proposed research program is to investigate homeostatic physiological mechanisms in a rat model of chronic sleep restriction.

Research in my laboratory has led to the development of techniques that are needed to achieve this goal. These techniques are designed to investigate short-term and long-term effects of daily sleep restriction on the regulation of behavioural state and physiological homeostasis in the rat. Specifically, extending previous research in this laboratory, we will focus our attention on two interdependent physiological systems; thermoregulation/energy metabolism, and the respiratory system. By studying these basic mechanisms we hope to gain insight into the way in which sleep debt may mediate or exacerbate ill health.

A few of the many industrial applications of phosphorus compounds are fertilizers, pesticides, fire retardants, and detergents. Phosphorus compounds also form a critical part of the energy cycle of cells, among many other biological functions. This proposal involves the development of new techniques for synthesizing compounds of phosphorus. Many important synthetic techniques in organic chemistry involve transition metal complexes. Since the chemistry of phosphorus often resembles that of carbon, techniques involving metal complexes may also be useful for forming phosphorus compounds. We will be developing new techniques for the synthesis of organophosphorus compounds, using transition metal complexes. Metal complexes are useful for stabilizing phosphorus in unusual environments that make it particularly reactive, and thus useful for synthesis. We are interested in phosphido complexes, which have metal phosphorus single bonds, phosphinidenes, which have metal-phosphorus double bonds, and phosphides, which have metal-phosphorus triple bonds. One application of our phosphorus compounds is synthesis of ligands for phosphine-based catalysts. Phosphine catalysts are important in many industries, including the pharmaceutical industry.

"Accompanying the rapid advances in structural biology is the definition of biochemical function and mechanism in terms of molecular forces in protein interactions and protein stability and folding. Knowledge of protein structure does not ensure accurate prediction of function and biological activity. To fully characterize specific biomolecular interactions in protein binding of substrates, other proteins or ligands such as substrates, nucleic acids, small molecule ligands or ions, a molecular understanding of driving forces in protein interactions requires knowledge of a number of different parameters. Thermodynamics provides information on the energetic forces that drive biomolecular interactions. This understanding of catalytic, binding and stability processes can then be exploited to tackle the complex processes underlying disease pathways and to devise strategies for combating diseases. The most common example of such strategies is the design of new drugs based on the likelihood of their binding to specific enzymes or regulatory proteins. In addition, new drugs are being designed that either interfere with or stimulate metabolic pathways within humans and animals to ameliorate aberrant biochemical processes causing disease symptoms. Research in the laboratory of the applicant is focused on understanding intersubunit signaling linked to catalytic turnover, protein stability of extremophilic archea proteins, protein-nucleic acid recognition, and stability and binding properties of GSAM, a key enzyme in chlorophyll biosynthesis.

Not only will the research enhance our knowledge of the allosteric communication in GSAM linked to catalytic turnover, but insights will be gained into structure-based design of highly selective herbicides. Because no counterpart of this enzyme exists in animals, it is a promising target for safe, selective herbicides and the rational design of such compounds. Understanding the intricate mechanisms of thermostability at extreme low pH, together with the complex formation of RHCC with a protease of the subtilisin family, will provide further information about the nature of protein stability under extreme conditions. The unusual capability of RHCC to incorporate cluster-like arranged water molecules makes it suitable for a new direction of research, the storage function of coiled coils. All these studies involve a combination of structural (X-ray crystallography and solution NMR) and spectroscopic (UV-Vis, CD, DSC and FRET) techniques complemented by in-vitro functional assays.

"The proposed research in Magneto-optics and Spectroscopy of Molecular Spin Electronic Devices and Nanostructures has broad implications for the science and technology of today and the future. Developing tools to understand how nanostructures and molecules interact with bulk materials, particularly electrodes, is critical to the success of almost any present day technology from sensors to photovoltaics. Research in the Steuerman group will revolve around improvement of molecular and nanoscale materials integration with a variety of electronic grade substrates, development of novel in situ probes for assessing device performance, and evaluation of new materials for electronics applications.  Specifically, we will combine concepts and optical techniques from spin electronics with materials and devices from molecular electronics.  To this end, we will explore the selection rules of new systems ranging from semiconducting nanowires to molecular monolayers.  Additionally we will study how long quantum coherence can last in novel nanoscale materials. We are not in the race to build the next quantum computer, but we are looking for the materials that might make it to that finish line.

"Imagine you need to choose a tie or scarf to accompany your outfit. You will temporarily need to remember the colours in your outfit to choose an appropriate accessory. The type of memory that is used to briefly maintain this visual information is known as visual working memory. Interestingly, this type of memory has been shown to be extremely limited, so that you can only remember about four colours or four shapes at one time. 



How can this type of memory be enhanced? If you are busy talking on the phone, so that you cannot use verbal strategies to remember all of the different colours in your outfit, can you group or ""chunk"" visual information to enhance your very limited storage capacity? Are these strategies different if you need to remember object information (e.g., a pattern) or spatial information (e.g., where items are in space)? In my research, I examine these ideas using a method known as change detection. Participants view a study display containing a set of visual items. They maintain this information in visual memory over a delay period (or retention interval) and then are presented with a second display (i.e., the test display), which sometimes differs from the first display. Participants indicate when the two displays are the same or when they are different. My research group uses various methods, including this change detection task, to investigate how humans can enhance the storage capacity in visual memory and also the differences that may exist between working memory for objects and working memory for spaces or locations.

"I am interested in the mathematics of finite and discrete systems: graphs, geometries, networks, computer data structures, efficient software and communications.  I am proposing research in two main areas of discrete mathematics: design theory and combinatorial Gray codes.  Both of these are interesting in their own right and both also have many interesting applications to computers and communications including reliability testing, error recovery, automatic scheduling, and efficient algorithms.



Designs are collections of sets that have nice intersection properties; for example, no two sets share more than one common element; or every triple of elements appears in exactly two of the sets.  My research in this area focuses on covering arrays, resolvable designs and 2-factorizations.  These have applications to software testing, scheduling and distributed computing.  Many of the mathematical objects that I investigate have properties explicitly defined by a requirement arising from their application.  These often result in beautiful mathematics as well as enhance the efficiency of the application.



I am also interested in finding special orderings of families of objects.  Orderings where consecutive objects differ in a small way are called Gray codes and have many applications in digital sensors, efficient storage and generation of data and efficient distribution of resources.  I have found new Gray codes, shown that some do not exist and worked on codes that permit fast computations.



Recently I have become interested in combining the two previous areas to look at orderings of the blocks of designs.  I have developed a general framework for discussing these codes and solved several open problems in the area.  This synthesis has applications for error correction of digital data, robust distributed computing and conflict avoiding scheduling.

"Life science researchers in Canada use as many fish as either rats or mice in their experiments. The Canadian Council for Animal Care (CCAC) Guidelines for use of fish in research do not contain any specific recommendations regarding the use of analgesics (""pain killers"") because we do not have sufficient information to make the appropriate recommendations.  The purpose of the research in my laboratory is to test some fundamental assumptions regarding analgesics and analgesia in fish.  We propose to develop tests that can be used to produce dose-response curves (that is, how much drug is required to get an effect) for morphine and other analgesics.  We also propose to measure how long these drugs are effective as ""pain killers"".  The question of whether or not fish can ""feel pain"" is a very difficult one.  In our experiments, we simply look for a response to a stimulus that would be considered painful to humans and to other mammals.  The stimulus we use is either a small electrical shock or an injection of a very small drop of acid (we use acetic acid, which is the major constituent of vinegar).  These stimuli are the same as those that are to study analgesics in mammals.  In addition, we test drugs that normally block the effect of morphine in mammals (naloxone and naltrexone) to see if they will block the effect of morphine in fish -- this will provide further evidence that the analgesics are effective.","Fundamental aspects of analgesia in fish","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal physiology and metabolism"

"The Precambrian Shields around the world contain the oldest rocks on the planet and as such, they lie at the heart of our understanding of the formation and evolution of our planet's mantle and continental crust. The growth and stabilization of the continents and formation of the ocean basins also represent a fundamental difference between the Earth and other rocky planets of the solar system. The details of the initial formation and subsequent modification of the continental crust and mantle constitute the principal focus of my research. My research program proposes to continue the study a newly discovered tract of ancient crust (3.8 billion ears: Ga) that rates among the oldest on the planet. This old crust is located in the Canadian Shield of northern Quebec (Inukjuak region) and in studying this crust we can place constraints on some of the fundamental questions of our planet's geological evolution; such as: How and why did continents begin forming? Did the Earth's mantle evolve in a similar fashion as those of the Moon and Mars (a planetary evolution) or follow different path (a terrestrial evolution). Rocks from oceanic islands and ocean ridges indicate that the present day mantle consists of depleted and enriched reservoirs. How were these different reservoirs generated? The answer to this latter question is being addressed in an isotopic study of the Monteregian Hills in SW Quebec. Studying the isotopic composition of the Canadian Shield has also allowed us to constrain changes in the source of sediments to the North Atlantic Ocean through past glacial cycles. The same technique can be applied to the Arctic Ocean to study the effects of changes in oceanic circulation as a result o melting the Arctic ice pack. This work will be carried out through a combination of geological field studies and geochemical and isotopic analyses (Lu-Hf, Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr) of the rocks collected in the field. The field studies will constrain the degree of deformation, metamorphism and stratigraphy of the rocks in the Inukjuak region. The analytical studies will constrain the sources of the rocks. Funding for these projects will provide support, training and research costs for 4 graduate students over 5 years.

"Recent natural language processing (NLP) applications---such as web searching and information extraction---have achieved impressive results by adopting `knowledge-lean' approaches that treat word semantics very superficially.  Nonetheless, we are frequently left with a feeling of frustration that these systems do not truly understand our queries or the documents being processed.  Building systems that can automatically determine the meaning of electronic text at a deeper level requires more sophisticated linguistic knowledge about words, yet hand coding such knowledge is infeasible on a broad scale.



The research proposed here has two primary goals.  The first goal is to develop methods for the automatic acquisition of lexical knowledge, in order to better capture the complex information encoded in words, as well as their interrelationships.  We adopt a `knowledge-informed' approach that is distinguished by the incorporation of linguistic and psychological observations into novel techniques for statistical corpus analysis, enabling us to alleviate the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck in NLP.  The second goal of the research is to apply the same knowledge-informed perspective within the processing of lexical resources, to ensure that computational lexicons and word/concept ontologies can be used more effectively and with less manual effort.



In the long run, research on automatic acquisition of deeper lexical information from text corpora, and techniques for more effectively using the resulting computational lexicons, will revolutionize the use of computers.  Even in the short term, the research proposed here will lead to improved NLP applications, such as web searching based on actual meaning rather than simple keyword matching, and information extraction that can be applied beyond circumscribed types of extracted information within a narrow domain.

"Trying to understand how the brain turns electrical and chemical signals into thoughts, meomories, and movements has fascinated mankind for centuries. Likewise, the devasting effects of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis prompt researchers to understand basic neural function in order to find cures for these diseases. Our research program takes a genetic approach to understanding basic questions in neurobiology, using the fruit fly as a test system. The nerve cells in the human brain and the fruit fly are remarkably similar in the way the develop and function, so when we learn something about a fly neuron we also learn something about ourselves. The work in the present proposal is aimed at understanding how one protein in the fly neuron contributes to its function. We aim to change individual components of this protein and then test how well the neuron functions after the change. We believe that these experiments will give us further insight into the detailed mechanisms of how neurons function, fly and human alike.","Genetic analysis of neural-synaptobrevin function","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,Neurophysiology

"I use molecular tools to study an unusual system of mitochondrial DNA inheritance in bivalves (e.g., mussels). Unlike all other animals, mussels possess two distinct gender associated lineages of mitochondrial DNA, which is normally only inherited through females. However, in mussels, males possess and transmit a distinctly male-associated mitochondrial DNA lineage. My lab seeks to understand whether this unique male associated mtDNA lineage might be an adaptation for sperm function and/or whether it may play a role in sex determination. This research is of fundamental importance for understanding the basis of mitochondrial DNA inheritance in animals generally, as well as the functions that mitochondrial DNA may perform in addition to

the functions currently recognized (i.e., ATP production). My research is therefore of interest to evolutionary biologists, geneticists and zoologists. This unusual system of mtDNA inheritance is being studied by laboratories in the United States, Wales, Spain, Italy, and Japan. For Canadian labs to remain at the forefront of this research, specialized laboratory equipment such as that requested herein is essential.



The specific equipment requested herein is necessary to quantify small amounts of DNA and RNA. These nucleic acids are used to set up polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) that are necessary to identify genotypes and mitotypes of the mussels that I study as well as to study gene expression and patterns of molecular evolution of various mitochondrial genomes and interacting nuclear genes.","Nanophotometer  for qualifying DNA and RNA","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Molecular genetics"
"I study an unusual system of mitochondrial DNA inheritance present in bivalve mollusks. Unlike other animals, some bivalves possess two distinct gender-associated mtDNA lineages rather than just a single, female transmitted mtDNA lineage found in most animals. I am interested in testing various hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the origin and maintenance of this unusual system of mitochondrial DNA inheritance including whether it allows for natural selection to improve sperm performance in these mussels or whether these gender-associated genomes might play a role in sex determination. The distinct male and female transmitted mtDNA genomes found in marine mussels also undergo recombination, a phenomenon that was, until recently, not thought to occur in animal mtDNA genomes. My approach to studying this unusual system of mitochondrial DNA inheritance includes a combination of sperm motility analyses, sperm metabolic activity assays, and whole mitochondrial genome sequencing assays.

The anticipated outcome of my research is to advance our understanding of basic biological processes primarily in bivalves but this knowledge might also apply to other animal groups. This knowledge would be of general interest and value to geneticists, invertebrate biologists and zoologists generally. The advancement of pure knowledge in the area of sex determination in bivalves may have applications in the field of aquaculture or in the development of biological controls for invasive freshwater mussel species through artificial control of sex ratios.

My research has broad implications for interpreting the molecular evolution of mitochondrial genomes. For example, my research program will provide essential data for interpreting bivalve CoxI sequences, which are the basis of the ""Barcode of Life"" initiative. Correct interpretation of DNA barcodes of native marine and freshwater mussels will be increasingly important as these species face threats from global climate change and global transport of invasive bivalve species.

"This project will develop biomedical technology by which cartilage surfaces in human joints can be optimally reconstructed to repair localized defects in the joint. This work has the potential to reduce the cost of surgical intervention, provide earlier treatment, reduce or delay the need for total joint replacement, increase patient health and quality of life, and improve treatment outcomes.

The joint cartilage surface is reconstructed with a surgical procedure known as ""mosaicplasty"", which involves the transfer of small, cylindrical plugs of bone and cartilage from the non-weight-bearing surface of the joint to the location of the defect. A number of plugs may be used to cover the cartilage defect, depending upon the defect size and the desired shape of the reconstructed surface. The procedure is currently done without any computer planning or guidance, and with only minimal use of joint imaging data.

Technology will be developed to improve all aspects of treatment, from detection to surgery. New methods will be developed to: detect and model defective cartilage using MRI and using an arthroscopic probe determine the ideal, reconstructed cartilage shape; plan an optimal mosaicplasty surgery by determining an optimal configuration of bone plugs to use; develop new surgical tools for plug cutting and placement; and provide computer-assisted tool guidance in the operating room.

This project will train seven MSc students, two PhD students, and a software engineer in the areas of computer-assisted surgery and joint biomechanics. There is a critical shortage in Canada of highly-qualified people in these areas.

Three Canadian companies will be closely involved with the research and will benefit directly from technologies generated by the project: specialized surgical tools will be developed with Canica Design, Ottawa tool tracking technology will be built for an arthroscopic probe made by BioSyntech, Inc, Laval; and new surgical interfaces will be incorporated in the surgical guidance software of iGO Technologies, Inc, Kingston.

"Computers are used in surgery to improve patient outcomes and to reduce operating times.  My research is about visualization methods and user interfaces for computer-assisted surgery.  



We are developing methods to visualize potential errors in the surgical guidance system so that the surgeon can take these errors into account when guiding a surgical tool into a patient.  This visualization will warn the surgeon when there is a risk that the computer's guidance information is too inaccurate to proceed safely.  We are also investigating principles of optimal surgical interface design.  Such principles will describe, among other things, what information should be presented to the surgeon, when it should be shown, and at what resolution it should be drawn.  This will improve surgical user interfaces and result in safer surgeries with less time in the operating room.  



We are also developing hardware devices to improve surgical procedure.  Usually, the surgeon cannot touch the computer because it is not sterile, and relies upon an assistant to operate the computer.  This process is slow and error prone.  We are developing an interface device to allow the surgeon to directly control the computer.  This will improve surgeon/computer interaction and reduce errors in the operating room.  Finally, we are developing tool guides that are custom-manufactured for each patient to guide surgical tools in operations to remove a tumor from the eye.  This has the potential to reduce operating times by 30 minutes, for a substantial cost savings.



Through an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach with clinicians and surgeons, the students who undertake these projects will receive training in visualization methods, user interface design, and clinical practice, and will be highly employable.

"QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGIES FOR CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT OF STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS 

As civil engineering structures continue to evolve in addressing newer challenges in design and fabrication, a heightened priority exists for significant improvement in economy, reliability, and safety at the early stages in the design process. This phase of design is characterized by greater fluidity, abstraction, and uncertainty than the later stages. While innumerable tools are available to assist the structural engineer in the later stages of design, this is not the case during conceptual design. As designs progress, concepts become more concrete while the level of uncertainty decreases. It is widely accepted that the earlier in the design cycle a decision is made, the greater the overall cost implications. The earlier a design may be validated for future consideration, favoured, or excluded, the more efficiently those resources may be allocated to explore the most beneficial design alternatives. The development will involve direct interaction with industry by having the research personnel tightly integrated in the design group.

The research addresses the lack of structured tools to aid the structural engineer during conceptual design. The proposal focuses at the early stages in the design process taking into account the variability of initial parameters and resulting scenarios. The physical form of a structure is the most elemental constituent of a conceptual design solution. This will be used to identify patterns that exist between efficient structural forms and design requirements, thus relating the form to the required function and behaviour of such structures. It promises to eliminate some drawbacks of traditional methods used in conceptual design by allowing the engineer to identify the distribution of both the numerical output and solution reliability over the entire design space. In addition, the tools will help to create or recognize efficient structural forms and evaluate designs in terms of requirements such as strength and stiffness. A framework of tools of this type could prove to be invaluable to practicing engineers during conceptual design.

"The Evolution of Magnetic Fields in Galaxies



The Earth has a magnetic field. We use a compass to find the direction of the magnetic field wherever we are, and use it for navigation. It stands to reason that other planets can also have a magnetic field, even though we do not always understand how they are maintained. In fact, magnetic fields are widespread in the universe. Our Milky Way Galaxy and other galaxies have remarkable large-scale magnetic fields, that affect the evolution of the entire galactic system. In space, magnetic fields can be as important or even more important than gravity, by restricting the movement of charged particles. That is why the Aurora mostly occurs around the Earth's magnetic poles. In a galaxy like our own, the magnetic field helps contain within the galaxy hot gas enriched with chemical elements like carbon, oxygen, and iron produced by nucleosynthesis in stars. It also makes it more difficult for gas clouds to collapse under gravity and form new stars. Despite their importance in astrophysics, the origin of magnetic fields in galaxies is shrouded in mystery. In my research I use the largest radio telescopes in the world to reveal the properties of magnetic fields in galaxies nearby and far away, looking back in time billions of years to the time when galaxies were formed. In this way we can observe how magnetic fields in galaxies changed over time from the epoch of galaxy formation to the present. My work involves the astrophysics of magnetic fields and the development of techniques for calibration and processing for the next generation of radio telescopes.

"Characterization of the molecular composition of a solution has long been a significant challenge in chemical research.  In solution, the molecular composition may be far more complicated than in the solid or gas phases because of the ionic status or protonation status of the species.  Even the exact identification of a single species in solution may require many techniques to provide only a 95%-certainty answer.  Identifying each of the components in a mixture, and especially, identifying species that may result from chemical complexation between species in solution is almost impossible without solution phase mass spectrometry.  In particular, the recent technique of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has revolutionized solution chemistry and biochemistry.  This application is for funds to purchase an electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometer (MS) with a time of flight (TOF) mass detector for a large number of researchers in the department of chemistry at the University of Western Ontario.  The ESI mass spectrometer is the most recent powerful tool for probing chemical reactions and molecules.  The application is for an instrument with a mass range 50 - 20,000 amu.  The five applicants and many other groups on a less frequent basis will use this invaluable technique in studies of a range of chemistries.  Previous significant studies that were enabled by ESI-MS data include (i) characterization of the first Ge(II) complex by Baines' group, (ii) determination that macrocyclic oligomers of up to 14 Au atoms have formed by Puddephatt's group, (iii) characterization of the composition of an important class of molecules, ionic liquids, prepared by Ragogna's group, (iv) synthesis of nanoscopic assemblies of metal-chalcogenide frameworks by Corrigan, and (v) discovery of new methods to measure how metals bind to proteins through time- and temperature-dependent kinetic data and as well an understanding of the pathway that the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can acquire the iron required for survival.  Each of these diverse studies points to the remarkable and essential value of the ESI-MS-TOF technique in chemical and biological research.","Electrospray ionization mass spectrometer","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Inorganic chemistry"

"C. jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide and thus constitutes a major public health threat. Despite this high incidence, a clear picture of the processes involved in Campylobacter infection has not yet emerged, preventing the development of new therapeutics and prevention strategies, including vaccine approaches. Traditional, reductionist and hypothesis-driven research have provided important, yet isolated, insights into Campylobacter pathogenesis. Currently, strategies for detecting, preventing, controlling and eliminating Campylobacter transmission are lacking or inadequate. There is an urgent need for novel anti-Campylobacter intervention, due to increasing resistance of C. jejuni to available drugs. The main goal of this research project is to understand the mechanism of Campylobacter jejuni colonization and pathogenesis

with respect to the identification of novel vaccine antigens using systems biology approaches. Objective 1 focuses on the mining of C. jejuni genomes and gene expression data to identify surface exposed proteins expressed under in vivo or in vivo mimicking conditions. Objective 2 consists in characterizing the surfaceome of C. jejuni using proteomic approaches. Colonization factors constitute ideal vaccine antigens since they are less likely to be subject to evolutionary changes. Therefore, objective 3 focuses on the integration of the data generated in objectives 1 and 2, and the identification of colonization factors. The results from the proposed studies will reveal new promising Campylobacter vaccine candidates for prevention of Campylobacter disease. In addition, it will generate new insights on the mechanism of C. jejuni interactions with its environment and its host. In turn, the gained knowledge could be translated by Variation Biotechnologies Inc. in

"Recent advances in Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) have produced a robust, field-portable (<30 kg) instrument that is one-tenth the cost of a typical IRMS, yet produces 13C/12C measurements that are just as precise. Because of their low cost, field readiness, ease of operation, and ability to make measurements in real time at fine temporal resolution, these instruments are poised to cause a revolutionary advance in isotope science. This RTI proposal requests funds for a field-portable CRDS system.  The analytical engine of the system will be a Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer designed to measure 13C/12C values in CO2 gas and equipped with a multi-use inlet manifold.  Our goal is to make the maximum scientific impact with this remarkable device. We will achieve this objective in three ways. (1) The instrument will be used 24/7 for 365 days each year.

This proposal seeks to address a group of related questions concerning explosive volcanism, taking a series of complementary approaches involving fieldwork, experiments, and numerical analysis. The research will address three related aspects of explosive volcanism:



(1) Explosive volcanism in the submarine environment will be studied by detailed field studies of Axial volcano, an active submarine volcano in the northeast Pacific Ocean, and by a series of analogue shock tube experiments.



(2) Explosive volcanism associated with caldera supervolcanic eruptions will be examined by detailed field, petrologic, and geochemical studies at Valles caldera, New Mexico.



(3) Seismic signals called banded tremor, which can be used to forecast explosive eruptions, will be analyzed for their overall characteristics and seismic signatures. Analogue experiments will be undertaken to simulate tremor mechanisms.



This research will make fundamental contributions to igneous processes, to fragmentation phenomena, and to risk mitigation.

"The University of Alberta Biogeochemical Analytical Service Laboratory has been established as a premier analytical facility both within Canada and internationally. This facility is devoted to leading edge research into the biogeochemical cycling of elements and pollutants in the environment, and providing a dynamic environment for the training of highly qualified personnel (HQP). Under the umbrella of the Biogeochemical Analytical Service Laboratory, we established a specialized Low-level Mercury (Hg) Analytical Unit devoted to globally-competitive and cutting-edge research on the biogeochemistry of Hg, a global pollutant. In fact, the number of fish and wildlife Hg advisories has been steadily increasing around the world. Methyl Hg (MeHg) is the Hg species of most concern because it is a strong vertebrate neurotoxin that readily and rapidly bioaccumulates through food webs to concentrations that may be harmful to consumers including humans. MeHg is therefore arguably the most important Hg species for which samples can be analyzed because it is the one of main toxicological interest. However, on a day-to-day basis, the greatest challenges to analyzing samples for MeHg concentrations remain with the complexity and labour-intensiveness of the manual MeHg analytical protocols themselves. The Low-level Hg Analytical Unit desperately requires an automated MeHg analytical system for a number of reasons: 1) it has a detection limit (0.002 ng/L) up to 5 times lower than our current manual system; 2) it can process up to four times more samples daily than we can do manually; 3) its simplified, more efficient protocol would support more research programs and training of HQP (in fact, the laboratory currently has to turn down requests for MeHg analyses); and 4) it would reduce the costs of analyses which are commercially exorbitant. The automated MeHg analytical system will be readily available for the training of all HQP with university, government and industry sponsored research projects, with far reaching impacts on global environmental and health policy.

"Hydroelectricity is currently touted as relatively ""green"" due to its low per unit energy greenhouse gas emissions. However, reservoir creation has many other environmental impacts, including the production and bioaccumulation of methylmercury (MeHg; a toxic form of Hg) into fish. To accurately quantify the net effect of reservoir creation on the biogeochemical cycling of Hg, researchers require measures of atmospheric loadings of Hg to intact forested watersheds, and an understanding of how these inputs change following flooding. These atmospheric inputs of MeHg and inorganic Hg(II) can then be subtracted from exports of MeHg and Hg(II) from reservoirs to determine, for example, the net production of MeHg within the reservoir itself. The overall objective of our proposal is to quantify wet and dry atmospheric inputs of MeHg and Hg(II) to Manitoba Hydro reservoirs and watersheds. This will be accomplished by initiating a wet deposition Hg monitoring program at a Manitoba Hydro generating station to be used in conjunction with a long-term and expanding dataset of wet and dry deposition being collected at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario. Our research will allow Manitoba Hydro to more accurately quantify and predicatively model the net impact of reservoir creation on the biogeochemical cycling of Hg and the bioaccumulation of MeHg in fish. Such information will also allow Manitoba Hydro to accurately compare its net Hg ""footprint"" per unit energy produced relative to that associated with burning coal in North America to produce an equivalent amount of electricity, and better explain the environmental benefits of hydroelectricity production. Our dataset will also contribute to ongoing studies examining the net export of Hg from Manitoba Hydro watersheds to Hudson Bay, where certain species of marine mammals contain high enough concentrations of Hg to be of concern to First Nations peoples using them as a traditional food source. Finally, our proposed research will contribute via the newly initiated Environment Canada Clean Air Regulatory Agenda (CARA) Mercury Science Program to our overall understanding of Hg deposition across Canada.","Quantifying wet and dry atmospheric inputs of mercury to Manitoba Hydro reservoirs and watersheds",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Atmospheric chemistry (including air pollution)"
"Human activities have elevated global atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to levels that have resulted in an unequivocal and unprecedented warming of the Earth's climate system. This is especially true in the high Arctic, where in the past century average annual temperatures have increased at almost twice the global rate. In polar desert regions of the high Arctic, large amounts of CO2 could be sequestered from the atmosphere through primary production if tundra vegetation colonizes the desert ecosystem in response to increased warming. In contrast, in regions with large stores of organic carbon in soil, the increased soil activity that will result from permafrost degradation may cause increased decomposition and release of CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere, positively feeding back on global climate warming. We are proposing to quantify the impacts of climate change on the net exchange of CO2 and CH4 from both terrestrial and aquatic landscapes in Quttinirpaaq National Park, Ellesmere Island, to determine if this region is currently in a phase of net primary productivity or net decomposition, whether future warming will result in positive or negative feedbacks of GHGs to the atmosphere, and what role Arctic ecosystems will play in future trajectories of climate change. However, the costs of conducting research in the Canadian high Arctic are exorbitant. The costs of travel alone for my students to carry out the proposed research program (e.g., return flights Edmonton/Resolute Bay, subsistence at sites, and logistic costs including shipping freight) approximate $40,000 annually. Therefore, any NSERC funding that can augment these high travel costs will in turn free up funds for the direct costs of research and further training of HQP. Furthermore, we wish to ask for additional supplementary funding to attend symposiums to present our findings to communities in the north that are affected by climate change, and foster scientific and social discussion about future directions of our research.","Net ecosystem exchange of carbon greenhouse gases in high Arctic ecoregions","Climate and atmosphere",CANADA,CANADA,"Terrestrial ecology"
"Human activities have elevated global atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to levels that have resulted in an unequivocal and unprecedented warming of the Earth's climate system. This is especially true in the high Arctic, where in the past century average annual temperatures have increased at almost twice the global rate. Current climate models predict that in certain regions of the Canadian Arctic, by 2100, autumn/winter temperatures will increase by up to 9 C, while annual precipitation will likely rise by 35%. Such warming and wetting is anticipated to result in permafrost degradation and glacial melt, increased surface runoff, pond formation and/or drying, and increased vegetation growth (i.e., primary productivity) on landscapes. In polar desert regions of the high Arctic, large amounts of CO2 could be sequestered from the atmosphere through primary production if tundra vegetation colonizes the desert ecosystem in response to increased warming and wetting. In contrast, in regions with large stores of organic carbon in soil, the increased soil activity that will result from permafrost degradation may cause increased decomposition and release of CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere, positively feeding back on global climate warming. We are proposing to quantify the impacts of climate change on the net exchange of CO2 and CH4 from both terrestrial and aquatic landscapes in Quttinirpaaq National Park, Ellesmere Island. Such new and comprehensive measurements, at the most northerly landscape ever studied, are essential to determine if this region is currently in a phase of net primary productivity or net decomposition, whether future warming will result in positive or negative feedbacks of GHGs to the atmosphere, and what role Arctic ecosystems will play in future trajectories of climate change. From a socio-economic perspective, primary productivity provides energy for herbivorous animals like caribou, muskox, and numerous aquatic organisms including fish. Thus, understanding the net exchange of CO2 in high Arctic landscapes is important for predicting how abundances of certain organisms used as Inuit traditional foods may be altered due to climate change.","Net ecosystem exchange of carbon greenhouse gases in high arctic ecoregions","Climate and atmosphere",CANADA,CANADA,"Terrestrial ecology"

"The ionosphere and the neutral atmosphere in  the 100 to 500 km altitude range are both strongly affected by processes that start near the surface of the sun and give rise to the solar wind. The magnetosphere receives  energy and momentum from the solar wind. A large part of this energy and momentum is imparted to the ionosphere, which in turn transfers it to the neutral atmosphere. The primary focus of this research project is to study just how the coupling to the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere is unfolding. This means in part the study of turbulent processes, which are observed on scales ranging from cm to thousands of km. In this respect, we devote a substantial part of our research to scales a few m in size, which are particularly interesting because they  are easily detected by radars, revealing in the process many details about larger scale circulation  as well as at times pointing to violent local processes. Along these lines, we study how the ionosphere reacts to powerful radio wave heaters. In a separate kind of study we also investigate how sometimes large local electric fields and currents form in the ionosphere in response to magnetospheric perturbations. We explore the link between these ionospheric generated processes and ion outflows from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere, and we also study how the neutral atmosphere reacts to the local electrical currents that take place in these regions.  Finally, we take a more global view still of the system and study how the plasma circulation imparted by the solar wind is related to auroral activity, be it through magnetic substorms or other kinds of events. This part of our study extends to events when plasma from lower latitudes is sometimes injected to polar cap latitudes.

Glucose is the preferred nutrient for most animal cells, including man. To adapt to changes in nutrient supply, the availability of glucose has to be sensed at the cell membrane and rapidly communicated to the nucleus, which contains the genes arrayed on chromosomes. Once the signal has reached the nucleus, a unique set of genes is transcribed, ultimately leading to the production of proteins that promote proper uptake and metabolism of glucose. This signaling depends on the function of glucose carriers located at the plasma membrane and proteins in the nucleus called transcriptional regulators. The transcriptional regulators ensure proper gene activation, thereby connecting nutrient supply to metabolism. We propose to define at the molecular level the signaling events that connect the detection of extracellular glucose and the activation of glucose-regulated genes, reactions that are not completely understood. Using state-of-the-art methods in cell imaging, mass spectrometry and gene expression analysis we expect that our research will provide new insights into fundamental biological reactions. These processes are crucial to the physiology of cells, organs and organisms under normal and a large number of pathological conditions, including diabetes and obesity.

"The Cretaceous and Paleogene witnessed the most dramatic floristic evolution in the history of vascular plants.  During this time flowering plants appeared, diversified and rose to dominance.  Filicalean ferns and pinaceous conifers underwent significant evolutionary radiations.  Many other groups such as pteridophytes and gymnosperms suffered significant reductions in diversity or taxa became extinct.  Evolutionary turnover was accompanied by a dramatic increase in species richness, correlated with an increase in ecological complexity.  Flowering plant dominated forests replaced conifers and cycads.  Ferns radiated into niches produced by increased complexity of plant communities.  Pinaceous conifers diversified to dominate upland and drier habitats.  On the forest floor there was significant change in herbaceous ground cover as seen by the evolution of new species of bryophytes, lycopods and horsetails, and an explosive radiation of ferns.  Climate of western Canada changed dramatically as mean annual temperatures decreased from tropical conditions.  Alberta and BC are uniquely suited for studying these changes because they yield some of the most abundant sources of plant fossils in North America.  Compression floras of central and southern Alberta allow description of many new species, whole plant reconstructions and characterization of floras in the context of their environments of growth and deposition.  The most spectacular occurrences of anatomically preserved fossil plants are from the world famous Princeton Chert and several new sources of fossils in carbonate marine nodules from Vancouver Island and the Pacific coast.  Using traditional techniques to study anatomy, morphology, and phylogeny, as well as newer methods for three-dimensional reconstruction, epifluorescence, CLSM, SEM, and TEM, we will investigate the evolution of fossil plants from a number of sites. Studies will center on the last pre-angiospermous vegetation, early angiospermous floras and the history of fires, aquatic floras, and fruits and seeds of Eocene forests from British Columbia and Alberta.

"Medical imaging is undergoing a revolution fueled by both advances in imaging technology and advances in imaging probes. New probes, arising from discoveries in molecular biology, allow imaging of very specific molecular events - provided that imaging technology can be adapted to their detection. Central to realizing the potential of the medical imaging revolution are three challenges: (1) Imaging molecular pathways: Imaging of multiple probes simultaneously to follow related molecular processes; (2) Providing context: Combining the imaging of probes with the imaging of anatomy to localize the molecular events relative to underlying anatomical structure; and (3) Ensuring accessibility: Making the imaging technology cost-effective and widely deployable. An imaging technology with the potential to meet these challenges is Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). SPECT is inherently multi-spectral, allowing for the simultaneous imaging of multiple radioactively labeled probes. The rich functional information provided by SPECT can be placed into the context of underlying anatomy through hybrid SPECT/CT, which is readily available and increasingly popular. Finally, SPECT is already deployed widely throughout Canada. The inevitable evolution of SPECT to solid-state detector technology promises to multiply its multi-spectral capabilities. Our development of reconstruction algorithms designed for imaging large objects with smaller cost-effective detectors will help make this evolution more economically feasible. We propose to optimize SPECT for in vivo cell tracking - an emerging niche with applications in cardiac, neural, and pancreatic regenerative therapy; oncology; and developmental biology. Our theoretical work includes state-of-the-art computer simulations and reconstruction techniques; while our experimental efforts focus on phantoms and large animals (canines). The focus of our application is monitoring myocardial stem cell therapy in a canine model of heart disease because of availability in our research institute, and because it represents the majority of challenges to be solved in molecular imaging and cell tracking.","Development of SPECT for in vivo 3D cell tracking","Medical equipment and apparatus",CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical engineering"
"The transport of colloidal particles in confined environments occurs in nature as well as in engineered devices. The emerging area of microfabricated lab-on-a-chip systems aims at creating integrated small-scale devices that incorporate several bio-chemical functions such as sample analysis, synthesis and compound delivery. Many lab-on-a-chip devices transport small particles through their microfluidic channels; fluorescent particles are used as markers for biomolecules and drug-laden particles are used as drug carriers for advanced drug delivery. Even particles much smaller than the width of the flow channels have been found to deposit systematically in specific locations. Over time particles build up in these locations and block flow passages, which in most cases leads to device failure.

In previous work particle deposition in microchannel contractions has been described in general terms for suspensions of particles of uniform size as well as for suspensions with a range of particle sizes. In contrast, the work proposed here will aim at quantifying this mechanism in order to allow designing microfluidic systems that either prevent deposition from occurring, or that lead to predictable particle deposition inside a microfluidic device. Specifically, we will focus on the effect that channel geometries and flow conditions, as well as materials such as the surfaces of channels and particles as well as the pH and ionic strength of the liquid phase have on particle adhesion and subsequent channel clogging. For this purpose, microfluidic experiments will be coupled with particle flow simulations, both covering a wide range of geometries and materials.

"Symmetries occur naturally in the world and are of interest to many scientists including mathematicians, chemists, and physicists.  By placing an algebraic structure on the set of symmetries of an object, one obtains a group.  A representation is a way of identifying a particular group with another group that has properties which allow one to extract information about the original group.  Many representations are intrinsically complicated and it is desirable to find simplified methods for studying them.  This proposal is concerned with the study of representations for particular groups using other mathematical objects such as Schur algebras that allow one to discover information about the original representation.

"Locally compact groups are abstract mathematical objects which may be associated with the symmetries of a geometric figure, or the rigid motion of objects in nature. They have many applications, both to the mathematical and physical sciences. With any locally compact group, one can associate several useful collections of mappings into the set of real, or complex, numbers. An operator may be interpreted as a finite or infinite array of numbers, and there are also many relevant collections of operators associated to these locally compact groups.  A Banach algebra is a collection of elements such that each individual element has a length, and such that any two elements can be added or multiplied. The aforementioned collections of functions and collections of operators are examples of Banach algebras, and this proposal is concerned with the study of various properties of these Banach algebras in relation to properties of their underlying locally compact groups.

"The health of a country's road network is of considerable importance to its economy.  In most of the industrialized world, the network is fairly well established, thus emphasis has shifted toward monitoring, maintaining and improving the existing infrastructure.  Pavements deteriorate gradually over time due to repetitive traffic loading and environmental factors such as moisture and freeze-thaw cycles.  Given the increase in traffic volume and wheel loads, it has become increasingly important to develop: materials that can better resist damage associated with the traffic and climatic conditions; and new design and maintenance tools that aid in monitoring the road infrastructure and developing cost effect solutions with respect to maintenance strategies and rehabilitation.  The new mechanistic-empirical approach for pavement analysis and design requires more accurate estimates of the material response under the action of simulated traffic loading, taking into account variations in moisture and temperature conditions.  

   Emphasis of the proposed study is on determining resilient modulus and effects of moisture distribution on pavement performance and response to loading.  The objectives are to:

-  develop reliable techniques for interpreting nondestructive test data in order to better evaluate pavement integrity and determine the layer elastic properties required by the pavement analysis models

-  study the impact of moisture and freeze-thaw cycles, as well as the addition of granular reclaimed asphalt pavement to granular base, on resilient modulus of aggregates

-  investigate the effects of systematic and random variations in resilient modulus, due to varying moisture content, on measured surface displacements via the stochastic finite element method

   The procedures developed in this study will better take into account the limitations associated with using nondestructive test data and current analysis procedures, and the state-of-the-practice within the context of pavement-subgrade system identification and pavement design will be improved.","Evaluation and sensitivity of pavement-subgrade systems",Engineering,CANADA,CANADA,"Geotechnical engineering (including engineering geology)"

"This proposal continues my study of the systems responsible for attention and those responsible for higher level processing such as the recognition of meaning and ""objectness.""  This grant application focuses on the interaction from two directions.  First, how does the allocation of attention (or lack of it) affect our ability to process meaning?  Although the longstanding view has been that recognizing a word's meaning is somehow automatic and can be accomplished in the absence of attention, recent work from my lab is challenging this view.  The second, and largely neglected, issue is whether processes involved in the computation of semantics and object formation have consequences for the operation of attention.  Does the scope and activation of attention depend on the products of processing?  Finally, I also present a novel line of research aimed at investigating reliability and individual differences in attentional processing. These questions are investigated in the context of established paradigms and procedures (e.g., selection, exogenous and endogenous cueing, semantic priming, dual-task, visual search).  My contribution is to take these established paradigms and combine them in novel ways to ask questions that have not been previously addressed.  Pilot work in these areas suggests that the answers to these questions will force us to re-evaluate the underpinnings of a number of current theoretical accounts of the effects of attention on higher level processes, and will further our understanding of the nature of attentional processing.","A multi-faceted study of attention",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Cognitive science -- fundamental"

But how gene regulation, itself, evolves is understood poorly because the molecular models that describe how coding sequences change are inapplicable to regulatory sequences. I will use rule-based computer simulation to elucidate how gene regulation evolves.

(2) Individual Morphological Evolution - Closely related groups often produce very different morphologies, like humans and chimpanzees. I will use my expertise in mathematical modeling and graphical simulation as they apply to invertebrate skeletons to test whether different growth processes can drive morphological change, like those observed between sea urchins and sand dollars, which grow into domed and discoid adults, respectively, from similar juvenile morphologies.

(3) Population Phenotypic Evolution - Evolution traditionally is conceived as natural selection increasing mean fitness, with populations considered as large, interbreeding groups characterised by adaptations that are refined in stable environments. But recent theoretical considerations and empirical observations about our planet have emphasised a need for studying other modes by which species may evolve, modes for which mathematical equations may be inapplicable. I will use rule-based computer simulation to identify conditions under which phenotypic evolution is promoted in small breeding groups within populations, in which fitness may increase through interactions between natural selection and chance events, yielding new adaptations in unstable environments.

Ultimately, my goal is to develop a comprehensive computational model to study how animal species change, from genes through morphologies among individuals in populations.","Transdisciplinary & multilevel studies in computational biology","Modelling and mathematical simulation of natural processes",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal biology"
"It is well known that wildfires have a profound effect on vegetation in forested areas, however, they can also significantly impact water quality.  That impact can also extend downstream and potentially impact drinking water source quality and ecosystem health. This is because vegetation is one of the primary factors that governs key hydrological processes that impact both the rates and magnitude of fine sediment (silts and clay) supply and delivery to streams. In sub-alpine regions, wildfire-associated increases in fine sediment delivered to and stored in streams has significantly impacted water quality and sensitive aquatic habitat in downstream reaches. This impact is often evident in elevated heavy metal, biofilm, and nutrient levels. An improved understanding of the physical and chemical processes that govern the fate and transport of nutrients and contaminants bound to fine sediment is critical for the development of effective strategies to protect drinking water supplies and minimize the negative impacts of land use and vegetation change on water quality and overall river ecosystem health. 

          Currently, there is a knowledge gap regarding the physical properties of fire impacted suspended solids in streams draining forested catchments. Knowledge of these sediment properties and their subsequent impact on the erosion, transport, and deposition of fire modified suspended solids in streams is essential to the development of appropriate source water protection and management protocols for use by utility managers and other relevant stakeholders (e.g. regulators, consulting engineers). Accordingly, the overall goal of this work is to understand and mitigate the effects of sudden and/or catastrophic vegetation change on the storage and transport of sediment and associated nutrients in forested watersheds on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Results of the proposed study will improve source water management and protection strategies by improving the predictive capability of sediment and nutrient transport models.

"The highly conserved, well regulated ubiquitination pathway is an integral part of numerous cellular processes and is required for proper growth and development of eukaryotic organisms. The pathway effectively targets protein for degradation by the 26S proteasome and is also involved in protein activation, sorting and internalization. At the center of the ubiquitin conjugation cascade is the substrate binding E3 ubiqutin-ligase enzyme, which governs specificity of the pathway. Over 5% Arabidopsis genome is dedicated to protein ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation, the majority these genes encode for E3 ligases. A growing number of E3s have been implicated in diverse plant growth and developmental processes including photomorphogenesis, self-incompatibility and hormone signaling. However, the majority of E3s remain largely uncharacterized. The proposed research focuses on understanding the role of protein ubiquitination in plant development with particular interest paid to the function of the large and diverse family of RING (Really Interesting New Gene)- type E3 ligases. Of the 469 RING E3 encoding genes identified in the Arabidopsis genome only a handful has assigned biological functions. The objectives of this proposal include the functional characterization and identification of substrate proteins for sub-groups of RING E3 ligases. This research will identify novel roles for protein ubiquitination in plant development and make significant contributions to this area of research. Knowledge acquired from this work has potential implications in other areas of biological research, plant biotechnology and agriculture.

"The long-term objectives of this research program are twofold: scientific and methodological. At the scientific level, the long-term goal is to reconstruct centennial to millennial changes in Earth's magnetic field direction and intensity during the Late Quaternary in order to determine the high frequency dynamics of the geomagnetic field with a special emphasis on abrupt changes. The recent recovery of several high resolution (>1 m/ka) sediment cores from Eastern Canada and the Western Canadian Arctic along with the planned recovery of sediment cores from the Northwest Passage and Eastern Canadian Arctic will allow the first large-scale study of geomagnetic field dynamics in the Arctic, as well as the determination of the spatial extent of abrupt geomagnetic field changes. Another long-term scientific goal is to determine the influence of Earth's magnetic field morphology on the production rate of cosmogenic isotopes. At the methodological level, the long-term goal is to develop paleomagnetic regional master curves (inclination, declination and paleointensity) for Eastern and Arctic Canada, allowing the dating and synchronization of Late Quaternary terrestrial, lacustrine, marine and possibly ice core records. In addition, because the magnetic properties of the sediments measured for paleomagnetic purposes depend on the mineralogy, grain size and concentration of the magnetic grains, I also envision combining magnetic and physical property data to develop a rapid, non-destructive and high resolution original method to identify lithological variations associated with paleoclimatic or environmental changes in Eastern and Arctic Canada.

"I study the social, hormonal and environmental factors that affect how birds and mammals make parental care decisions.  Parents in biparental species (in which both parents provide care) should balance the needs of their offspring with their own and their partners' requirements for maintaining health and good body condition.  I focus on two mammalian systems where paternal care is flexible and shows considerable individual variation: humans and rodents.  We have shown that human fathers require more parental experience than mothers to develop the same level of hormonal responsiveness (i.e., changes in prolactin levels) to infant contact.  In this grant period I will examine how hormone levels and partner contact affect men's responsiveness to infants and men's willingness to perform extra parental work.  Demonstrating a link between parental interactions and fathering behaviour could help shape social policy that promotes increased father involvement in wider segments of our society.  In the proposed animal studies, I will examine how the distribution and abundance of resources (food) affect how time is budgeted between foraging and bouts of offspring care, research that may have implications for nursing success in human mothers.  My third study species is a seabird (common murre), in which extensive paternal care is critical to offspring survival.  Results from the seabird studies will add to our understanding of how within-pair interactions and yearly differences in food availability affect parental decisions. Through my continuing collaborative studies with government environmental agencies, my seabird research can also contribute to conservation and wildlife management decisions that will protect the marine environment.

"Until recently it was thought that bacteria were simple, single celled organisms and that their environmental advantage was very rapid growth.  However, it is becoming increasingly clear that bacteria are exquisitely sensitive to the environment and can function in communities called biofilms.  Much research is being directed towards an understanding of how bacteria function as communities and how they can respond to the environmental signals. Our research is focussed on an analysis of how a bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa can adapt to sometimes-hostile environments.  Our approach will be to look at the circuits that control the expression of bacterial genes and the how these circuits interact.  We will specifically examine three systems. One system allows the bacterial populations to communicate with each other and control the expression of genes so that population works together.  Another system is involved with controlling genes involved in the formation of bacterial communities or biofilms.  The third system controls the bacterium's response to nutrient deprivation that occurs during infection.  In the long term, research of this nature will lead to the development of new therapies to treat bacterial infections.

"My research program focuses on biochemical adaptation to environmental stress. In particular, my lab is interested in the phenomenon of hypometabolism, the ability to enter a state of torpor or dormancy in response to severe environmental challenges (e.g. subzero temperatures, oxygen deprivation, arid conditions) that are not conducive to normal life. We use vertebrate models of hibernation (ground squirrels), freeze tolerance (wood frogs) and anoxia tolerance (turtles) to explore the regulation of metabolism, the adaptations of enzymes and proteins, and the changes in gene expression that both engineer metabolic rate depression and provide long term cell preservation and life extension in hypometabolic states. Not only is this work important for understanding the universal mechanisms of metabolic design in Nature as well as the winter survival strategies of many Canadian animals but it has key potential applications in biomedicine. These include the development of strategies for inducible dormancy and for long term cryopreservation of donor organs removed for transplantation. Goals for continuing and proposed work over the next five years include: (a) investigation of the mechanisms that provide global suppression of gene expression during hypometabolism including histone modifications and the actions of microRNA species in determining whether mRNA transcripts can be translated, (b) identification of stress-responsive transcription factors that are activated during entry into hypometabolism, the suites of downstream genes that they control, and the functions of the selected proteins that are produced, particularly focused on cell preservation mechanisms including antioxidant defense, chaperone proteins, and inhibition of muscle atrophy, (c) exploration of the role played by autophagy - a controlled reduction and recycling of cell contents - to long term survival in hypometabolic states, and (d) control of enzymes and functional proteins via reversible protein phosphorylation to reprioritize metabolic needs and energy use during hypometabolism.","Molecular mechanisms of metabolic rate depression","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal physiology and metabolism"

"The goal of this collaborative project, proposed by IBM, DND and the University of Victoria, is to design,

implement and evaluate an interactive collaborative space for shared program understanding. Program

understanding is a challenging activity in the maintenance of older, legacy systems that may lack adequate

documentation. In such cases, teams of engineers often have to collaborate as they share and create new

knowledge using automated tools for analysis and visualization of a system design. Today's modern

development environments unfortunately lack support for teams undertaking a shared design recovery task.

Our goal therefore is to investigate how collaborative program understanding tools can better facilitate how

system and design knowledge is acquired, captured, annotated and shared within a team setting.

In this project, we propose to develop a theory of how software engineers collaborate to achieve a shared

understanding of already built software systems. We will build on and add to existing theories that describe

how software teams develop software. Using this theory as guidance, we will develop and evaluate innovative

tools that will improve distributed understanding activities and the shared creation of redocumentation artifacts

(such as visualizations and analysis reports). These tools will be extensions of existing program comprehension

and redocumentation tools, with additional collaborative features. We will conduct user studies and field

studies to evaluate the impact of these tools on collaborative understanding processes, both at IBM and at the

DND. These studies will thus inform our theories as well as bring suggestions for further tool improvements

"The objective of this research program is to design and analyse new algorithms for the exact solution of problems in the area of linear algebra.  Our focus is on problems involving matrices filled with integers and polynomials.  The goal is to discover algorithms that make efficient use of computer resources including time (number of required machine word operations) and space (memory requirements).



Fast algorithms for exact linear algebra are a central component of the mathematical engines of computer algebra systems.  Computer algebra is very widely used by researchers and practitioners in the mathematical, scientific and engineering communities.  Algebraic computations arise in diverse areas such as graphics and robotics.  The solutions of complex problems in these areas typically requires the solution of exact linear algebra problems, either as key steps during the computation or, in many cases, as the computational bottleneck.  Computational problems involving large integer matrices arise, for example, during the security study of certain types of cryptographic systems.  The development of new algorithms that are both rigorously analysed and practically fast is especially welcome.  We plan to implement prototypes of the algorithms we design and use them to solve large problems occurring in practice.

"This short-term research proposal aims to develop and test the optical imaging properties of a series of

compounds that are currently under development as radiopharmaceutical agents. Radiopharmaceuticals allow

for the noninvasive detection of biological processes within the body.

In collaboration with MDS Nordion (a Canadian company), we aim to expand the versatility of a series of

macrocyclic chelates towards their use as optical probes. Visualization of optical probes via fluorescence

microscopy allows for the study of uptake and localization at the cellular and subcellular level, thereby

affording information on the mechanisms responsible for localization in certain tissues such as tumours. This

data can then be correlated with in vivo radioimaging studies using gamma-emitting pharmaceuticals.

Demonstrating the optical imaging capacity of the probes under development as radiopharmaceutical agents at

MDS Nordion will greatly increase the appeal of these compounds. Researchers exploring optical probes do

not need to conduct research in close proximity to radiochemistry facilities, and are not bound by the timeline

imposed by radionuclide decay. The additional imaging modality allows for the efficient screening of new

agents via optical imaging at the cellular level, and in combination with in vivo radioimaging studies, provides

complementary information on biological processes under study.","Optical probe development for dual-function imaging agents","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Bio-inorganic chemistry"
"This interdisciplinary inorganic chemistry research program is directed in two different areas: (1) the use of endogenous catalysts in the brain to promote the synthesis of diagnostic and therapeutic molecules for treating neurodegenerative disease and (2) the development of catalysts containing two metal centers in close proximity to promote selective small-molecule oxidative transformations. Essential to this research is the study of how metal ions either in vivo or in designed coordination environments interact with substrates and perform in catalytic applications. 

(1) The increased incidence of neurodegenerative disease, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the lack of effective treatment strategies, makes this a very important research area. While the cause(s) of many of these diseases remain elusive, the build-up of redox-active transition metals is strongly linked to the etiology of AD. This research program aims to study the speciation of dysregulated metal ions, their interaction with specific biomolecules, and their ability to act as catalysts for molecular transformations. Working at the interface of inorganic chemistry and biology, this project offers opportunities to collaborate across disciplines to investigate innovative treatment strategies. 

(2) We plan to develop compounds capable of catalyzing the selective incorporation of oxidized functions into organic molecules. Bimetallic systems have great potential to promote this chemistry, often exhibiting reactivity not available to their monometallic counterparts. This unique reactivity can be in part ascribed to enhanced substrate binding, stabilization of reactive intermediates, and the presence of two metal ions in close proximity. Harnessing these features to promote specific small-molecule transformations will require detailed knowledge of the geometrical and electronic structure of the studied systems. By a combination of spectroscopy, calculations, and reactivity studies, we aim to develop new and efficient catalytic systems with diverse applications.

"We hypothesize that variation in feed efficiency (the ability of an individual to extract energy from its food) among cattle is mediated in part by differences in the composition of the rumen microbial community, because of the role of rumen bacteria in fiber digestion, the observation that additives that alter the composition of the rumen microbial population affect feed efficiency, and increasing evidence from other species that gut bacteria affect host traits such as obesity. We will explore the relationship between rumen bacteria and feed efficiency using both a species-centric and a gene-centric approach. The species-centric approach will involve isolating and sequencing a particular gene (called cpn60) from rumen bacteria, to estimate how many distinct bacterial species are present and to estimate their abundance. The gene-centric approach will involve extensive sequencing of random genome fragments isolated from rumen bacteria. We will use a variety of computational approaches to analyze the genome fragment sequences, to predict their functional properties and to identify the metabolic processes they support. The species- and gene-centric approaches will be applied to high feed efficiency individuals and to low feed efficiency individuals. The types and abundance of bacterial species, gene functions, and metabolic processes will be compared, to identify those that are associated with high feed efficiency. Long-term research will focus on understanding the mechanisms by which the bacterial species and genes we identify affect feed efficiency. The work described in this proposal will increase our understanding of the structure and physiology of the rumen microbial ecosystem. In addition to providing new diversity estimates for the rumen microbial community, this study has the potential to reveal novel species; unexpected protein families and metabolic functions; and new enzymes of biotechnological importance. Of particular practical interest will be microbial species or genes found to be associated with high feed efficiency. Knowledge of these species and genes may eventually lead to more efficient animals that produce fewer greenhouse gases, and reduced feed costs for Canadian livestock producers.

"The proposed research is directed at the use of highly conductive graphitic foams for convective heat transfer enhancement in engineering systems. Graphitic foams can be produced with a void structure that is interconnected enabling the passage of fluid and thus the removal of heat energy conducted into the solid matrix of the foam from adjacent heat sources. The proposed research seeks to address the premise that highly-conductive graphite foams can offer substantial enhancements over existing solid and porous materials in single and multiphase heat convection, thereby having a substantial positive impact in electronics cooling, primary cooling and energy recovery.

  Graphitic foams have a significant advantage over aluminum and other reticulated metal foams because of their moderate porosity, high solid phase conductivity, which can be as much as six times higher than solid aluminum, and large internal surface area. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is central to the proposed research both in terms of fundamental development of new techniques and mathematical models, and through its application to investigate heating and cooling problems. Specific objectives of the proposed research program include the development of mathematical models to explore multiphase convective heat transfer in porous foams, theoretical optimization of the graphite foam structure, and the implementation of a sophisticated turbulence closure to enable investigation of a wide range of heating/cooling problems.

  The proposed research has a broad range of fundamental and practical goals, all of which will be explored by graduate students at the MESc and PhD levels under the supervision of the applicant.  Further, the blend of fundamental and practical objectives enables students to gain experience in an exciting, emerging industry.  Exploration into graphite foams and their application may have an enormous impact in the automotive, electronics and energy production industries, since even modest enhancements can have a significant impact on the size or effectiveness of a heat sink or heat exchanger.

"A mechanistic understanding of the biophysical controls on carbon exchange necessitates a study of how intra- and inter-annual climate trends affect surface-atmosphere exchanges. The proposed research will quantify the dynamics of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide between a boreal ecosystem and the atmosphere. Tower-based fluxes of CO2 will be continuously measured using micrometeorological methods over a black spruce forest and peatland ecosystem for several years in the eastern James Bay region of the boreal forest. The two field locations are located within several kms of each other and are therefore subjected to the same environmental conditions. Light use efficiency (LUE) will be derived from tower-based measurements of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and gross ecosystem productivity. The influence of environmental controls on the variation in LUE at each site will be investigated using the set of micrometeorological and biophysical variables. Remotely sensed vegetation indices have been shown to be correlated with LUE at a variety of spatial scales. Upscaling of fluxes will therefore be accomplished using a combination of remote sensing techniques. Tower-mounted radiometers will be used to provide high resolution continuous measurements of vegetation indices. Relationships between vegetation indices and tower-based fluxes will be developed from these field measurements. Ground based algorithms will be applied to comparable satellite-based indices resulting in ecosystem scale estimates of carbon exchange. The research is designed to provide increased knowledge of the critical processes and environmental forcings which drive the atmosphere ecosystem C exchange on time scales ranging from instantaneous, seasonal, annual through inter-annual. Detailed information on ecosystem physiological responses can further be used to modify and validate ecosystem models - becoming tools for studying responses to changing climate.

"ASSESSING SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN PEAT HYDROPHYSICAL PROPERTIES



Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle storing at least 25% of global soil carbon stocks, emitting significant quantities of methane and releasing dissolved organic carbon to oceans.  Feedbacks between ecology and hydrology are vital to the function of these ecosystems and occur at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.  A lack of knowledge regarding spatial variability in peat soil hydrologic properties, and how these properties change through time as the soil decomposes, has limited our ability to model the development and predict the fate of peatlands.  The proposed research will quantify the variability of hydrologic properties between and within microtopographic units in a peatland by field and laboratory determination of these properties.  The effect of decomposition on these same hydrologic properties will also be determined.  This will be completed by comparing peat of different decomposition status along soil cores and by conducting laboratory and in-situ decomposition experiments.  This research will provide data required to parameterize new peatland models which incorporate ecohydrological feedbacks, helping to improve our understanding of peatland development, hydrology, ecology and biogeochemistry.

"Chemical research will figure prominently in addressing a number of societal challenges, including: (a) the development of environmentally friendly methods for the conversion of abundant raw materials into value-added products, including pharmaceuticals; (b) the more efficient utilization of our diminishing hydrocarbon resources; and (c) the identification of recyclable materials for the controlled release of combustible molecules such as hydrogen. One difficulty common to these challenges is the selective breaking and reforming unreactive substrate E-H bonds (E = H, C, N, P, etc.). When appropriately constructed, transition metal complexes are able to activate (i.e. induce reactivity in) typically unreactive molecular fragments, including E-H bonds. While significant advances have been made in metal-mediated single E-H bond activation catalysis, related processes involving the activation of two E-H bonds within a substrate (double E-H bond activation) are comparatively few. Given the central role that double E-H bond activation could play in addressing the reactivity challenges outlined above, the design of metal catalysts that can mediated double E-H bond activation reactions represents an important, yet formidable, challenge.



My research group has recently developed a new class of zwitterionic catalyst complexes (some of which are now commercially available through Strem Chemicals) that mediate catalytic double E-H bond activation processes. In the course of our investigations, we became intrigued by the possibility that the unique and aggressive reactivity of these zwitterionic catalysts might be attributable to cooperative metal-indenide substrate activation. This proposal seeks to build upon our exciting discoveries, with emphasis on the development of novel cooperative catalysts featuring donor-substituted indenide ligation that can promote challenging and synthetically useful double E-H bond activation chemistry in a manner that cannot be achieved by use of more conventional catalyst systems.

The Strap research group has been working to identify key signaling molecules involved in plant-microbe interactions as well as the microbial contribution to biomass turnover. This research will have a positive impact on Canadian agriculture and will aid in the development of improved cellulosic feedstock for use in biosolvent production. In addition, the Strap research group in collaboration with the Kumar research group has identified and partially purified novel, bioactive microbial compounds effective against a broad spectrum of human pathogens. The acquisition of an HPLC system is necessary to purify these compounds for structural determination. This research will significantly impact Canadian society by providing new knowledge about microbial resistance mechanisms and will allow for identification of new therapeutic targets to deal with highly resistant pathogens.  The Bonetta research group aims to understand mechanisms that govern cell wall synthesis and assembly in plants. An HPLC will allow characterization of cell wall mutants through determination of oligosaccharide profiles of wall material. The insights gained from this research will be crucial to the development of cell wall derived products such as plastics, fibres, and fuels, which have the potential to improve the sustainability of Canada's natural resources and environmental quality.

"Ocean circulation plays a key role in the earth's climate system. Relevant to the work proposed here, it redistributes heat, provides an important boundary condition for the atmosphere and provides a sink for atmospheric CO2. There is a growing awareness in the oceanographic community that knowledge of a very fundamental aspect of ocean circulation is lacking: we do not understand its energetics. This has practical implications (e.g., to climate modelling) in that the response of these models to changes in forcing are likely dependent on model energetics. For example, although a coupled atmosphere-ocean model may be tuned to adequately reproduce current conditions, its response to changes in atmospheric composition will likely differ from that of the actual coupled system if the model energetics do not reflect those of the actual system. 



Here, we focus on two aspects of ocean circulation energetics: the wind power source and a potentially important exchange of energy between essentially geostrophic currents (such as the Gulf Stream, etc.) and high frequency (near-inertial) gravity waves. The work considers both rectangular basin and Southern Ocean (allowing for a ""Drake Passage"") geometries and uses a range of models from relatively approximated to increasingly complete representation of the dynamics. In all cases, we focus on high resolution, for which the mesoscale eddy field is well resolved. Since the Southern Ocean figures prominently into an overall picture of the energetics, we also reconsider theories of its dynamics. Also, because a mechanism we consider as important to determing the wind power input to the geostrophic circulation also affects the vertical Ekman pumping velocity over mesoscale eddies and currents, we also examine the effect of this on uptake of passive scalars input from above. Finally, note that other recent work in ocean energetics focuses on tidal mixing and the meridional overturning circulation: this is not the focus of the work proposed here (which deals more with wind-driven circulation).

"Applications of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for civilian purposes are highly desirable in the fields of natural resource surveying, security surveillance and others.  Although many UAS are under development, there are significant barriers to their use such as cost-effectiveness and safety.  Consequently, the UAS must be autonomous to avoid stationary and moving obstacles, to fly along the predetermined paths to survey the required target area, and to contain on-board health monitoring.  Only partial system solutions are currently available.



This proposal stems from the development of the UAS ""GeoSurv II"" for geophysical airborne surveys at Carleton Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (M&AE) in partnership with Sander Geophysics Ltd (SGL) of Ottawa.  The design started as a M&AE undergraduate 4th-year project in the academic year 2004-2005.  In order to meet the challenging system requirements, graduate research was initiated in four key areas, namely Autonomous Operation (AO), Obstacle Detection (OD), Magnetic Signature Control (MSC), and Low-Cost Composite Structures (LCC).  The progress made since 2006  indicates that practical solutions are achievable.  The newer fifth project will address the special aspects of gathering geophysical data by UAS. This research named Geomagnetic Data Acquisition (GDA) is a collaboration with the Department of Earth Sciences at Carleton.  Results of the proposed research will provide significant contributions to Canada.  They will enable cost-effective natural resource surveys of our landmass, especially in the North, thereby helping in efficient and environmentally responsible geological exploration.  The developed technologies will be suitable not only for other UAS missions but also for other aerospace and non-aerospace systems.  The proposed research will make significant contributions to the training of highly qualified personnel.

"The fungal pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis causes tan spot, an economically important disease of wheat.  Typically, the fungus attacks the leaves, causing the formation of lesions or spots that consist of dead (necrotic) and/or yellow (chlorotic) tissue.  These symptoms result from the production, by the fungus, of host-specific toxins that can attack some wheat varieties but not others.  One of these toxins, Ptr ToxB, causes the development of chlorosis on sensitive wheat leaves. Strains of P. tritici-repentis differ in their ability to produce Ptr ToxB, which is encoded in the fungal DNA by a gene called ToxB; decreased toxin production and differences in toxin sequence (molecular composition) can result in a reduced ability to cause chlorosis.  In addition, strains that express ToxB at a lower level also produce fewer infective structures, which are general indicators of the capacity of a fungus to attack plants.  In order to further understand the disease-causing ability of P. tritici-repentis and its interaction with wheat, we will: (1) investigate general pathogenic ability in the fungus and its relationship to ToxB/Ptr ToxB, by silencing expression of this gene in a virulent isolate, (2) characterize ToxB from all fungal strains that possess this gene or related forms, and (3) isolate and characterize Ptr ToxC, another chlorosis-inducing toxin predicted but never purified from this fungus.  The research will not only help explain virulence in P. tritici-repentis, but may also contribute to the development of knowledge-based strategies for controlling tan spot, thereby benefiting the Canadian agricultural industry.

"The proposed research is about using nonlinear optics to change the characteristics of the laser pulse and to affect the structure of media.  We will start with short pulses in the near infrared of the spectrum and produce a rainbow of colours.  We will overlap the colours in time to make shorter, more intense pulses than the input. The ultrashort pulses will be used to explode molecules so that we can determine the positions of all the constituent atoms in the molecules. We will also use nonlinear optics to push the wavelength from the near infrared out to the mid-infrared, where the lower frequencies correspond to the vibration times of molecules.  The mid-infrared radiation can then measure or control the vibration. Finally, we will use the short near infrared pulses to create microscopic bubbles into the crystalline lens of the eye to determine if the bubbles can be made in such a way as to increase the elasticity of the lens and thereby possibly provide a cure for presbyopia.

"Changes in cell shape are associated with a variety of developmental processes including cell migration, patterning of the nervous system, cell division, and transport of molecules in and out of the cell. We have been studying the role of the navigators, molecules that are required for the migration of cells and neuronal processes in both worms and humans, and have shown that they exert their influence by re-organizing actin filaments, the network of cables that make up part of the cytoskeleton and control cell shape changes. The objectives of my research program are to elucidate the role of the navigators and their molecular partners in actin cytoskeleton processes such as cell migration and the trafficking of molecules inside the cell. These studies have implications for diseases such as cancer, as well as neurodegenerative disorders, and healing after neural injury.

"Our knowledge of human spinal cord anatomy and function comes from invasive studies of anaesthetized animals, and from observations of the effects of injuries in humans, and from post-mortem studies.  While these have yielded a wealth of information, there are still features that are poorly understood.  The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made it possible to observe human internal anatomy non-invasively, and functional MRI (fMRI) has enabled mapping of neuronal activity in response to a stimulus.  Studies carried out in my lab with these methods have revealed previously unknown features of anatomy and function.  For example, a link has been observed between attention to a sensation and neuronal activity in the spinal cord.  We have also discovered that the motion of the spinal cord that occurs with each heart-beat decreases in amplitude lower in the cord, and the lumbar region is essentially motionless.  This latter finding is the basis for the first part of this proposal.

Over the course of 10 years of development of fMRI of the spinal cord in my lab it has been determined that the motion of the cord within the spinal canal is a significant source of errors.  Similarly, MR imaging that is sensitive to water diffusion (diffusion-weighted imaging, DWI) and its use for tracing white matter tracts in the brain, have been attempted in the cervical spinal cord and brainstem, but with limited results because of this motion.  We now know that we can measure spinal cord fMRI and DWI data with varying amounts of motion contamination, from none in the lumbar regions progressing to the maximum in the cervical regions.  The first objective is therefore to determine the specific effects of this motion on the imaging data, and based on this information develop methods of eliminating or compensating for it.  The subsequent research will then develop reliable and sensitive fMRI, DWI, and tracing of white matter tracts spanning from the spinal cord to the brain to provide a complete map of functional and anatomical connections for a given sensation or task, for the first time in a living person.

"The objective of this project is to develop a framework for understanding, planning and managing the evolution of Service-Oriented Applications (SOAs). The term ""service"" is an interestingly ambiguous abstraction, representing (in Computing Science) well-defined, network-accessible hierarchically composable software modules, and (in Business) value co-production between organizations and customers, frequently supported (or even driven) by software. I strongly believe that this ambiguity signifies a ""phase transition"" in the business of software engineering, where strategic business decisions on ""what new service processes to deliver"" imply the need for (and are enabled by) the evolution of the SOA driving the current processes. 



The proposed work will develop a framework for managing and systematically supporting the evolution of service systems. I take a broad view of ""service systems"" including software (designed in an SOA style), hardware and interaction mechanisms with external people and systems, in order to address two fundamental questions: 

(a)how should service systems be designed, managed and evolved to support business strategy? and, 

(b)how should business strategy be informed by the evolution potential of the service system  supporting the business? 



To that end, the three project activities focus on developing a strong foundation for analyzing and understanding change in SOA systems, developing a method for systematically planning for change, and analyzing the costs and benefits of potential changes in both technical and business terms.

"The development of statistical methodology to analyze data that arises from genetic studies of disease traits has been advancing at a slower pace than the advances in technology to produce such genetic data.  As a result, investigators have had to make use of methodology originally developed to analyze data that arose in a manufacturing setting.  There are some limitations associated with the use of such methodology in genetic analysis, which we discuss here.



In addition to methodology designed with a manufacturing motivation, there are other emerging approaches that are specifically appropriate for the analysis of genetic data; one such approach is the evidential or pure likelihood approach.  This approach is particularly well-suited to genetic data since its conclusions reflect the information that the collected set of families (or cases and controls) provide, and does not impose standard paradoxes that have resulted from using methodology not designed for the analysis of genetic data.  There is now evidential methodology available to conduct parametric linkage and case-control association studies of disease traits.  Here we propose to increase the breadth of genetic applications to which evidential analysis can be applied, including association using quantitative traits, linkage analysis of quantitative traits, family-based association studies, and for the analysis of time-to-event data with genetic predictors.

"While the lifespans of different animal species vary widely, our understanding of why this occurs is limited.  An interesting observation, however, is that longevity is associated with 'cellular stress resistance', that is, the ability of the individual cells comprising an animal to tolerate exposure to potentially lethal stressors.  Interestingly, the same tolerance to stress that confers longevity seems also to provide resistance to various diseases, including common neurodegerative diseases associated with aging.  These recognized relationships make it particularly important for us to understand the actual mechanisms that make cells stress resistant, because such knowledge might be used to improve longevity and/or the overall health of older individuals.  I am proposing research that will, with a relatively modest investment of funds, help to move us along a path to positively affecting the aging process through an improved understanding of cellular resistance to stress and disease.  I am proposing research in 3 areas: (1) To investigate cellular stress resistance in existing animal species that naturally have quite different lifespans and understand what they do differently. (2) To investigate cellular stress resistance in mice with a specific gene mutation that makes them live about 50% longer.  I will be particularly interested in discovering whether the same mechanisms are involved in coferring longevity in both contexts (between species and within a single species). (3) To investigate how resveratrol works to enhance cellular stress resistance.  We have shown that this substance, found in red wine and other dietary sources, is able to increase cellular resistance to stressors, possibly by causing cells to produce more of their natural antioxidant enzymes.  We will continue to move forward with this work, with the goal of fully understanding the mechanisms by which resveratrol elicits this response.  This three-pronged approach will allow us to develop a much better understanding of how animals achieve longevity and disease resistance.  In turn, this will continue to increase the foundation of knowledge that can be translated into novel remedies for disorders associated with aging.

"Transformation to the forest biorefinery could represent an important opportunity for the Canadian forestry industry to revitalize and strengthen its long-term competitive position. At the same time, the forest biorefinery could be an important environmental opportunity for Canada, especially from the perspective of reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, it is not obvious which biorefinery strategies are the most economic for forestry companies to implement, nor which provide the largest GHG reductions. Certainly the impact of government policy should be to influence the selection of biorefinery options that encourage the implementation of sustainable biorefinery opportunities, and specifically, to promote those that are

environmentally preferable. The goal of this proposal is to develop systematic methodologies that quantify these important issues. Techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA) will be used to quantify the sustainability of several biorefinery implementation strategies, under different energy policy scenarios. A systematic LCA-based methodology will be developed that is suitable for achieving this objective, including consideration of social impacts expected from biorefinery implementation. A set of economic, environmental and social indicators characterizing the sustainability of biorefinery strategies will be developed, and then evaluated for different biorefinery process-product options using the case study context of the two participating industrial partners (Domtar and Norampac). Subsequently, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) will be used to interpret and weight the various indicators in order to identify the preferred technology/energy policy alternatives in each case study. The results of this research project will benefit the industry collaborators directly, as well as the Canadian forest industry sector at large via the systematic methodologies to be developed. Furthermore, the results of this study should benefit government, and other institutions that are interested in energy policy.","Method for economic and environmental evaluation of sustainable forest biorefinery strategies","Alternative energy resources",CANADA,CANADA,"Environmental engineering"

"It was 25 years ago when R. Feynman published his inspiring paper about quantum computers.  At that time it was just an intriguing idea - far from any experimental implementation.  Since then a remarkable progress has been made, which can be seen for example in today's computer technology. Thanks to continuous miniaturization of microelectronic circuits, sizes of elements have already reached sub-micrometer scale and according to general tendency in next 10 years the microelectronics on-chip components will reach tens of nanometers scale.  At this size the physical description changes from classical to quantum physics laws.  It is envisioned that future electronic circuits will consist of quantum dots connected with quantum wires.  Due to these revolutionary changes of the paradigm not only does it change the principles of operation but also offers new practical opportunities.  The most challenging of them is quantum computer, which is theoretically predicted to be superior to classical one for solving certain problems such as secure encryption, factoring of large numbers, data base search, and others.

This project is devoted to investigation of novel quantum structures prepared by the state of the art technology called nano-template Chemical Beam Epitaxy on pre-patterned substrates, in our case made of Indium Phosphate, InP. This technology allows us to fabricate different nanostructures at precisely designed locations, for example: conducting quantum wires, self-assembled Indium Arsenide (InAs) quantum dots at the apex of nano-size ridges, and nano-rods. A special attention in this project will be paid to the scaling opportunities offered by this technology to fabricate and study complex electronic circuits containing several quantum dots connected by quantum wires.  We will also explore advantages of a large spin-orbit interaction of the new material system and its usefulness for purely electrical spin manipulation.  Our long-term goal is to develop new technological platform for charge and spin q-bits, the basic building blocks of a quantum computer, and study their quantum-mechanical properties.

"Today, 3D design is important to many application areas, such as architecture & interior design, industrial & mechanical design, simulation, training, entertainment, etc. Most current 3D design software is targeted at the late design process, where refinement happens. Few tools can be applied productively in the early design process, where ideas are generated, alternatives are investigated, etc. The consequence of this is that designers do not explore the design space well, which leads to suboptimal design results. The insight behind the current proposal is that different tools are needed for the early phases of the 3D design process to enable people to be creative, explore the design space better and hence generate better designs, which in turn leads to more competitive products. While tools cannot directly be creative, they can stimulate creativity. For example, software tools for the early design stages need to be simple to use - so that users can concentrate on the design, not the interface - yet powerful and need to foster creative exploration. My previous work has already yielded 3D software that is easy to learn and simple to use.

The current proposal will develop enhanced software tools for the early 3D design process. In particular, it proposes novel techniques to create and modify common object shapes such as slanted surfaces and curved objects. Also, we will look at efficient methods for the easy manipulation of large-scale designs. A second area of research will develop software tools to make work with several versions of a design easier, as early design work rarely involves only one design alternative. Another aspect will focus on merging different versions and investigate techniques to support the iterative nature of the design process better. The third area of research will target collaborative design, as most 3D design projects involve several stakeholders. Due to limitations of existing systems, collaboration is usually limited in the design process. Based on a novel interactive table and wall infrastructure, the research will evaluate in collaboration with professional designers how design is affected by systems that allow participants to freely collaborate during a meeting.

"Our program goal is to improve weather-forecast quality in coastal and mountainous terrain, and to better predict weather-related disasters.  To do this, we start with computer codes called numerical weather prediction (NWP) models that solve the fluid-dynamics equations of the atmosphere.  We modify these models to better resolve smaller-scale weather features -- critically important in complex terrain.  With these NWP models as tools, we will pursue the following projects, and will test our success by comparing our research forecasts daily against surface weather observations.

     One major project is to write a new NWP model that successfully handles one of the weaknesses of current models -- strong winds over steep mountain slopes.  This will take several years.  Another project, strategic in nature, is to transfer the technology of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) computer chips to weather forecasting.  This will enable NWP models to complete their forecasts sooner while more accurately forecasting the weather.  A third project is to improve predictability by better use of weather observations, both from an international field program upwind (west) of Canada, and locally via deployment of a dense, high-resolution network of weather stations.  We will integrate results from all this work into models for natural hazards and natural resources:  - mountain precipitation for hydrological models to better predict floods and manage hydroelectric reservoirs;  - mountain winds that affect W. Canada forests via tree blowdown and forest fires;  - mountain snowfall as affect avalanches and the 2010 Winter Olympics; and - pollutant transport as affect air quality and global warming.  This research can save lives, allow industries to thrive, improve the economy and tax base, and support effective stewardship of resources in W. Canada.

"Nonsmooth nonlinearities, often referred to as ""hard nonlinearities"", are either discontinuous in nature or cannot be continuously differentiated over the entire domain. Important examples include mechanical backlash, dead-zone, friction, and hysteresis. These nonlinearities are very common in industrial control systems, ranging from high technology applications (micromanipulation in semiconductor manufacturing, high performance robotics, ultra precision turning of turbine shafts, micro-fluidic systems in cellular biology) to traditional applications (electro-hydraulic positioning systems, machine tool control, robot manipulators, active suspension control, automotive drivetrain systems, injection moulding machines). Nonsmooth nonlinearities often severely limit system performance. An important example is piezoelectric actuators, which are finding many new applications in areas demanding high precision. The major limitation of piezoelectric actuators, however, is limited accuracy due to hysteresis nonlinearity. The maximum error due to hysteresis can be as large as 15-20% of the full range of motion if the actuator is operated in an open loop manner. Without the aid of feedback control techniques to overcome the hysteresis effect, it is only possible to achieve limited positioning accuracy.

    For decades, the existence of such nonlinearities have provided one of the most difficult challenges to control design engineers since the entire Laplace domain and most state space control design techniques were developed exclusively for differentiable linear or nonlinear systems. It is obvious that the development of control techniques for overcoming the effects of the non-smooth non-linearities in the dynamic systems is of significant theoretical and practical interest. The objective of this research is the development of control theories, engineering design methods and technology for non-smooth dynamic systems in the presence of model uncertainties, arising from parameter variations or from neglected dynamics. The targeted industrial applications includes high precision positioning control of nanoscale platform manipulators.","Dynamic control of nonlinear systems involving nonsmooth nonlinearity with application to industrial systems","Manufacturing processes and products",CANADA,CANADA,"Control systems"

"The remarkable progress in the understanding of the rheology of branched and hyperbranched macromolecules have been catalyzed by the ability to synthesize well-defined polymers of complex architectures. Developing functionalized polymers is an important and challenging theme, especially in the research and development of polyolefins. The presence of functional groups in the non-polar polyolefin chains imparts functionalized polyolefins with some enhanced materials properties such as toughness, barrier properties, surface properties, miscibility with other polar polymers, etc. One potential area of interest is to combine catalytic olefin polymerization with successive living/controlled polymerization of polar monomers (such as anionic polymerization, atom transfer radical polymerization or ATRP, nitrogen-mediated radical polymerization or NMRP, and reversible addition fragmentation techniques or RAFT) to prepare functionalized polyolefins containing blocks of functional comonomer and having well-defined architectures such as star-shaped, comb-shaped, and block olefin copolymers. 



The primary focus of this proposal will be development and rheological behavior of chain-topology-controlled functionalized hyperbranched polymers (HBP) that have unique dendrimer-like branched structure with lack of chain entanglements, resulting in dramatically reduced melt viscosity. The objectives of the proposed research are (a) to synthesize hyperbranched polyolefins containing blocks of functional comonomer having well-defined architectures and block olefin copolymers catalyzed by novel functionalized catalysts using controlled free radical polymerization with successive living/controlled polymerization of polar monomers, (b) to characterize the synthesized polymers, and (c) to study the linear rheological properties of the synthesized polymers and relate it to the topology by combining different models of relaxation with the concept of hierarchical motion.

"Secretory vesicles store important chemical substances such as transmitters, hormones and inflammatory substances and release them through exocytosis at the plasma membrane. Exocytosis in mammalian cells is tightly controlled by intracellular signals including calcium and GTP. Supported by the funding from NSERC, we have identified the critical roles played by a small GTPase protein, Ral, as well as the exocyst protein complex (composed of 8 proteins) in GTP-dependent exocytosis.

Secretory vesicles are generated from the Golgi network and transported to the plasma membrane. Although vesicular trafficking is one of the fundamental subjects in cell biology, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown, particularly in mammalian cells. In this renewed proposal, we continue to work on the exocyst proteins but aim to elucidate their functions in the context of more general trafficking and exocytosis of secretory vesicles rather than to focus on their roles in GTP-dependent exocytosis. We hypothesize that the exocyst complex plays multiple roles in vesicular trafficking and exocytosis. To test our hypothesis, the present proposal has the following two specific aims. 

(i) To determine the precise function of each member of the exocyst complex in vesicular trafficking. The exocyst complex is composed of eight proteins. We will generate secretory cell lines in which the expression of each member of the exocyst complex is strongly knocked down and analyze the consequences of the knockdown in terms of vesicular trafficking and exocytosis through various approaches that include imaging (light and electron microscopy) and biochemical secretion assays. 

(ii) To determine the structural requirement of these exocyst proteins through the rescue of the knockdown cells. 

Our research will elucidate the precise function of each member of the exocyst complex and by doing so will significantly improve our understanding of the trafficking of secretory vesicles in mammalian cells.

"Plant secondary metabolites such as flavonoids (UV protection), isoflavonoids (Rhizobium nodulation), anthocyanins (floral color), and antimicrobial phytoalexins are all derived from polyketides synthesized by the members of chalcone synthase (CHS) superfamily. These enzymes are small (homodimer of ~42 kDa subunits), yet remarkably complex enzymes and catalyze multiple-step reactions at a single active site. Thus, they provide a good model for other multi-component polyketide synthases, which are responsible for biosynthesis of a variety of useful natural products including antibiotics, immunosuppressants and anticancer agents. Recent structural and mechanistic studies on CHS and related enzymes have yielded insights into enzyme mechanisms and the molecular basis of biosynthetic versatility of the CHS superfamily. Stilbene synthase, another representative member of the superfamily, has attracted much attention in transgenic crop development due to the antifungal activity and a number of beneficial health effects of stilbenes. The proposed mechanistic study on the STS-catalyzed cyclization reaction using unexplored bioorganic chemical approaches will provide much needed insight that should prove valuable in the manipulation of polyketide biosynthesis through metabolic engineering. Already underway are studies on CHS-like enzymes from a cyanobacterium, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium, a moss, and a primitive plant, horsetail. Results obtained from these studies will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of enzyme family and metabolic pathway in plants and microorganisms. Finally, the moss homologue of anther-specific CHSs may provide insights into the poorly understood process of plant male fertility.

"Our current understanding of the functional role of dietary lipids in male reproductive health is inadequate. Since lipids and fatty acids are the main components of membrane composition, it is important to understand the different types of dietary lipids, transport mechanisms, and functional roles in androgen and sperm production. Male reproductive health problems associated with an aging population in North American and around the world is increasing. Since we are also facing an epidemic of obesity which adversely affects male reproductive health, this research is very timely and will also help to develop future non-pharmaceutical therapies that would lower  health care costs in an already over burdened health care system.



The main goal of this research program is to investigate the different roles that specific dietary lipids have in sperm maturation, and testosterone production in the testis, where significant lipid changes take place during sperm cell development. Testis contains unique lipids, such as high sphingomyelin, cholesterol and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and sulfoglycolipids. However, our understanding of this lipid class is preliminary and can be expected to expand substantially. It is well known that dietary fats and lipids are involved in a variety of cellular and molecular functions once absorbed in the body. By providing dietary sources of n-3 and n-6 fats, conjugated linoleic acids, and sphingolipids to animals (lean and obese rats, Sprague Dawley rats), my research will investigate their metabolism and function in testis and sperm. This proposed research will provide an understanding of the basic mechanisms on how nutrients reduce the risk of germ cell loss and abnormal sperm and hormone production, a major cause of male infertility.

"Riverbed scour in the vicinity of bridge abutments (hereafter BAs) has been identified as an issue with potentially catastrophic consequences. Excessive scour can cause abutment damage, which can result in bridge failure. According to Melville (1992), 29 out of the 108 bridge failures in New Zealand between 1960 and 1984 were attributed to abutment scour. 

River ice is an important factor affecting riverbed deformation in Canada. Under ice-covered conditions, the location of maximum flow velocity is closer to the riverbed than during open-flow conditions, and results in increased bed shear stress. Thus, the riverbed scour depth around BAs under ice cover should be greater than in the absence of ice. Local scour processes around BAs/piers may lead to a disaster, such as the collapse of a bridge in 1990 over the White River in Vermont, and the collapse of the Highway 16 bridge across the Bulkley River at Smithers, B.C. in 1966 due to ice induced local scour around BAs/piers. 

The proposed experimental study will address some important gaps in the scientific literature, such as:  (a) assess riverbed scour processes around BAs under ice cover, (b) develop equations describing the dependence of scour processes on flow intensity, particle grain size and boundary conditions, (c) understand how ice cover alters the geometry of scour holes and deposition mounds, and (d) investigate the impacts of the dimensions of BAs on local scour processes under ice cover. As my LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE, the proposed research will  lay a foundation for the establishment of a research team engaged in research work regarding cold region hydraulic engineering at UNBC. This research would address topics such as: (a) a systematic study of river ice hydraulics and ice-covered alluvial flows using an 78.2-me long outdoor flume (we are seeking funding to modify this infrastructure for our use) at UNBC's Quesnel River Research Center, (b) development of a modeling system to simulate riverbed deformation under ice-covered conditions, and (c) a study of riverbed scour processes around BAs and other types of hydraulic structures under ice-jammed conditions.

"Structural Health Monitoring/Management (SHM) through adequate prediction of the remaining useful life of structures is a major area of interest for the aerospace community, especially considering aging aircraft where the growing maintenance costs can reduce their economic life. Also, composite structures due to their high strength-to-weight ratios, high stiffness, inherent corrosion resistance, and improved fatigue performance offer many advantages over the conventional metallic materials, and therefore are utilized in a variety of load bearing structures such as helicopter rotor blades, aircraft fuselage, rib chord, trailing edges, and cargo doors. This makes the understanding and then improving durability of composite structures very critical. Recent aircraft structural failures caused by undetected faults have resulted in a change in philosophy in design and maintenance of aircraft from fatigue safe-life to damage tolerance. The objective of this research is to develop a structural health monitoring and life prognosis approach to gradually replace current schedule-based

maintenance tasks of metallic/composite damage tolerant structures, where components are inspected after a pre-established number of cycles, by condition-based maintenance, where components are maintained prior to attaining an insufficient remaining useful life, based on the criticality and specified confidence bounds. The scientific and technological challenges are to obtain a reliable assessment of past and current status of the structure, in terms of loading spectra, damage location and severity, by implementing and embedding sensors with adequate spatial resolution, and to obtain a reliable and safe model to predict future damage evolution.

The proposed solution is to use a variety of sensors for load monitoring and large area detection, localization and assessment of the severity of defects; and life prognosis of composite structures. To accomplish these objectives, the research program will focus on the manufacturing of two and three dimensional composite structures with bonded/embedded sensors, monitor the manufacturing process for quality control, and structural health management of fiber reinforced composite materials.","Structural health monitoring of composite structures","Manufacturing processes and products",CANADA,CANADA,"Mechanical engineering"
"Health monitoring through adequate prediction of the remaining useful life of composite structures is a major area of interest for the aerospace community where the growing maintenance costs, estimated to $10 billion worldwide annually, can reduce their economic life. The objective of the proposed research program is to design and manufacture advanced composites integrated with fiber optic sensors to monitor the manufacturing process and to use the same sensor network to develop a damage prognostic approach to gradually replace current schedule-based maintenance tasks, where components are inspected after a pre-established number of cycles, by condition-based maintenance, where components are maintained prior to attaining an insufficient remaining useful life.  The current systems and technologies available for monitoring the health of the aircraft components are mostly based on load monitoring systems that determine flight parameters, and enable conclusions to be drawn concerning the load levels occurred during the flight, or scheduled maintenance by means of small area scanning processes such as radiography, eddy currents, ultrasonic or other appropriate methods. The existing methods are time consuming and cost intensive. Therefore, the availability of a non-destructive evaluation technology, which makes the structural health assessment an integral part of the aircraft components, known as Structural Health Monitoring, is crucial in terms of reducing time and cost associated with maintaining reliability of components. SHM is an emerging technology, dealing with the development of techniques and systems for the continuous monitoring, inspection and damage detection of structures, with minimum labor involvement.  The SHM focuses on finding answers to the very critical questions on: (i) damage existence in a structure and its type, (ii) whether the damage is local or global (e.g., a large isolated crack or many small defects distributed in the material),  (iii) the location of the damage whether the damage is in the material or in the joints and connections (or both), and (iv) finally find out whether the structure is likely to fail due to the presence of damage.

"Most of the proposed research topics are extensions of ones which I have recently studied in the theory of polymeric liquid crystals (PLC). These materials are important due to their many applications, such as to LC display devices, nanolithography, and biological structures. My recent research has examined two complementary athermal models of the polymer chains, one based on a discrete microscopic model consisting of bonded hard-sphere chains, the other employing a continuum ""wormlike-chain"" representation of the molecules. In both models, excluded-volume interactions between the molecules which lead to liquid-crystalline ordering are taken into account by means of the Onsager second-virial approximation. A main focus has been to study smectic liquid-crystalline phases of these models, which have a layered morphology similar to that of lipid vesicles, and to understand the interplay between the interactions and the degree of molecular flexibility in the formation of these phases. We are also interested in the effects of a confined geometry on the phase boundaries, which is relevant to systems such as DNA confined within viruses. A variant of the work on confined systems has been concerned with the behaviour of free-standing smectic films, in particular the phenomena of layer-thinning transitions. The proposed research will extend my recent studies in the following ways: (1) revision of the numerical algorithms for solving both the wormlike-chain and the hard-sphere chain models, in order to apply these to molecules with physically realistic length-to-width ratios; (2) extension of our studies of confined systems (so far limited to liquids trapped between flat parallel walls) to other geometries, such as cylinders and spheres; (3) studies of the dynamics of layer-thinning transitions for films having 1st-order isotropic-smectic phase transitions. Mixed with these topics, we will also study various fundamental aspects such as the nature of boundary conditions at a wall, inclusion of high-density effects, and ""self-interactions"" between polymer chains in the wormlike model.","Theory of nonuniform complex liquids","Materials sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Soft condensed matter"
"When a gas, which may be malodorous, flammable or toxic, is released into the atmospheric boundary-layer one would like to know the probable concentration values encountered at various locations and times. These concentration values are very difficult to predict or to measure.The environment is in a turbulent state and the very irregular values of concentration recorded in field (and also in laboratory) measurements commonly exhibit extreme excursions of concentration that are many times the nominal average level. The usual descriptor used for the quantification of concentration values is the probability density function however this is impractical in the environmental context.

  A new measure for quantifying concentration values has been proposed. The new measure-The Expected Mass Fraction Function-has significant advantages both in terms of the relative simplicity of the equations that govern its evolution and in the relatively small amount of measured concentration data required to compile this statistic.

  The proposal is to experimentally and theoretically investigate the behaviour of contaminant concentration values using the Expected Mass Fraction Function.

"The Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering currently houses a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA) purchased through the assistance of a NSERC RTI grant in 1996. For 12 years, the instrument provided test data to dozens of students and research staff who needed to study polymer mechanical behaviour as a function of temperature. The basic instrument can measure mechanical properties, creep and stress relaxation response and identify molecular relaxation transitions.  It is, however, no longer in working condition even after multiple repair attempts to restore it. The present proposal requests funds to replace the machine and also to purchase a Thermomechanical Analyzer (TMA) to complement the DMA. The TMA measures dimensional change in thin samples. As the dimensions of engineering components shrink due to miniaturization of devices, there is a growing demand for better understanding of dimensional stability of thin plastic parts and films. In addition to the instruments, accessories that will allow tests to be conducted in controlled heat-humidity environments as well as full submersion in water have been requested. These new capabilities have only been recently introduced into the market; a signal that the polymer industry is requiring more accurate data from tests that more closely represent in-service conditions.  



The proposed equipment, to be housed in a central facility, will provide researchers in the Faculty of Engineering access to the state-of-the-art testing equipment for polymeric materials and composites. It will directly support the research groups of three senior faculty members and two new faculty members who are establishing new research programs in the areas of bio-polymers and nanomechanics. The new DMA and TMA capabilities will impact future mechanical characterization work in two ways. First, a wide range of materials ranging from stiff plastics to gels and foams can be studied and with high sensitivity. Second, research will now be able to separate inherent changes in material properties from extrinsic effects such as processing.

"The increasing shift to plastic materials for manufacturing automotive body components has led to considerable

weight savings. Even greater impact is expected if more under-the-hood metallic parts, such as heat

exchangers, are replaced with plastics. Although a number of all-plastic heat exchanger designs have been

patented, none has been developed for commercial use. A major barrier to adopting these designs for

under-the-hood automotive applications is the limited knowledge on the degradation resistance of plastic

materials when exposed to fluids such as coolant, water and oil at high temperatures. The typical service

temperature range is between 88 and 120 C, and can reach as high as 150 C. While plastics need to resist

corrosion and chemical degradation, as do metals, the mechanical and physical properties of plastics are

inherently time- and temperature- dependent, i.e. viscoelastic. This means that long-term dimensional and

structural stability become main concerns in assessing part durability, with the problem further exacerbated by

chemical degradation due to in-service environment.

The purpose of this study is to determine an appropriate plastic-based material and joining method for

developing a viable plastic heat exchanger. The investigation will compare polyamide, commercially known as

nylon, with the high performance polyethersulfone (PES). Nylon was considered to be a promising heat

exchanger material but the technology was not fully pursued for unknown reasons. Although PES has been

available commercially for some time, its application has been limited in the past due to relatively high costs.

This work will be an important milestone in evaluating the advances in PES development in terms of its

applicability for highly corrosive automotive environments and the feasibility of applying cost effective

manufacturing processes. Results of the comprehensive experimental study will lead to better understanding of

the material's long-term durability, particularly creep, and the viability of joints fabricated using advanced

welding methods such as laser, infrared and ultrasonic.","Thermal degradation of polymeric materials and joints for heat exchanger applications","Manufacturing processes and products",CANADA,CANADA,"Polymers and coatings"
"Adhesives are polymer-based liquids or films that are used to bond or join components. Structural adhesives have to be cured at elevated temperature to achieve the strength and stiffness needed for joint integrity. Cure is a term used to describe the chemical reaction when liquid resins harden to form a strong cross-linked polymer. An inherent characteristic of polymers is that their physical and mechanical properties are strongly dependent on both time and temperature. This phenomenon, known as viscoelasticity, presents potential problems in engineering since the long-term stability of polymers after processing is not well known.  

          The purpose of this research is to characterize the viscoelastic properties of adhesives used for assembling micro-devices during and after the cure process. These properties are intimately linked with the adhesive cure history, i.e., how the cross-link structure develops with time. Our study will focus on epoxies used in microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS) which are devices that can perform sensing, actuation and control functions on a single chip. The development of such miniaturized devices are expected to lead to new technologies with profound impact on science and engineering but their long-term reliability in service is a major hurdle towards commercialization. Adhesive bonding is an important fabrication technique for bonding multiple layers and filling in awkward joints in these complex devices. However, the dimensional instabilty of the thin adhesive layer can cause misalignment of the MEMS assembly, leading to sensor-signal shift.  

         Experimental work will be performed to assess reproducibilty of cure properties using current bonding practices and to measure adhesive properties as they develop when the liquid hardens. It is also possible to apply these results in MEMS design to prevent adhesive cracking by minimizing process-related stresses.  After the curing process, the dimensional changes occuring as the polymer ages in service will be measured and modeled. This research will provide device fabricators much needed physical insight into the uncertainties of processing and the sensitivity of long-term adhesive properties to cure history.

"The goal of this work will be to combine the work I have been doing in the areas of microfluidics (fabrication , design and modeling) with the aerodynamic studies with a goal of improved physical understanding of the flow mechanisms responsible for separation in a range of Reynolds numbers from 50-150,000.  The long-term goal is the development of control mechanisms based on synthetic jets, a device that allows local momentum inputs, with zero effective mass flow rate. 

In a growing number of new miniaturized mechanical systems, such as small-scale wind turbines and unmanned aerial vehicles, lifting surfaces operate at relatively low chord Reynolds numbers (Rec< 500,000). Airfoil operation at low Reynolds numbers differs significantly from that typical for high Reynolds number flows. In particular, a laminar boundary layer on the upper surface of the airfoil often separates and forms a separated shear layer. The presence of laminar boundary layer separation has a significant detrimental effect on airfoil performance, affecting airfoil lift and drag. The severity of this effect is mainly determined by the behaviour of the separated shear layer.

The naturally amplified disturbances are centred at some fundamental frequency. The initial growth at the fundamental frequency is followed by the growth of a sub-harmonic component, eventually leading to flow transition.   The shear layer roll-up on an airfoil, leading to the formation of the roll-up vortices, can be considered to be essentially inviscid in nature. The presented results can be employed for flow control applications, when the fundamental frequency of the naturally growing disturbances needs to be estimated, or to predict salient characteristics of the roll-up vortices. This will be done with synthetic jets placed directly on the airfoil.","Aerodynamic improvements to microair vehicles and wind turbines",Aerospace,CANADA,CANADA,"Fluid mechanics"

"The Canadian dairy industry generates 4.8 billions $ yearly. This industry depends on artificial insemination using semen from genetically superior bulls. International breeding trial programs indicated that daughters sired by bulls from North America were superior. Consequently, many developed countries imported several generations of genetically superior bulls from the Canadian insemination industry. As a consequence of inbreeding, fertility emerged as a growing challenge for this industry. Between 1990 and 2001, the Canadian dairy industry faced a 15% decline in fertility representing a major financial impact. The major objective of this CRD grant proposal is to develop diagnostic tools to evaluate fertility of bulls to help the artificial insemination industry in the selection of those individuals destined for semen production. 

Following its differentiation in the testis, spermatozoa transit along a long convoluted tubule called the epididymis. This organ secreted proteins that modify the biochemical components of spermatozoa; modifications necessary for the acquisition of their optimum fertilizing potential. We hypothesized that suboptimal acquisition by the male gametes of epididymal proteins is responsible for the inter-individual fertility variability. Using different biochemical techniques we proposed to identify these proteins to be used as markers of bulls' fertility. These technologies will be developed in a way that they could be applied on a large number of semen samples from bulls undergoing selection for semen production by the Canadian artificial insemination industry.

"A ""bluff body"" is an object or structure with a non-streamlined shape that significantly resists the motion of a moving fluid.  This resistance leads to bluff bodies experiencing very high drag forces.  Flow around a bluff body is complex, and is characterized by a large region of separated flow (where the flow does not follow the shape of the body), the formation of vortices from the surface of the body, and a low-pressure wake downstream of the body that is unsteady and turbulent. The phenomenon of ""vortex shedding"" occurs as vortices are released from the surface of the body, in a regular fashion, into the wake. Under certain conditions, vortex shedding may cause unwanted structural motion known as ""flow-induced vibration.""

     The flow around a bluff body becomes more complex when it is located in proximity to other bodies and structures. Groups of bluff bodies immersed in air or water flows are found in a number of engineering applications, such as clusters of buildings and chimney stacks, offshore oil drilling platforms, arrays of bridge pylons, and tube bundles in a heat exchanger.  Study of these flows is motivated by practical industrial problems related to flow-induced vibration, turbulent buffeting, noise generation, erosion (or scour) of streambeds, mixing and dispersion of contaminants in the atmosphere and rivers, downwash from chimney stacks, and high wind loading caused by aerodynamic drag forces.

     Prevention of flow-induced vibration, development of flow control strategies (to mitigate vortex shedding or avoid stack downwash, for example), and reduction of aerodynamic drag (to improve fuel efficiency of a transport truck, for example), require a physical understanding of the ""fluid-structure interactions"" for the flow around groups of bluff bodies.  The complex nature of these flows, however, poses significant challenges for field measurements, laboratory experiments, and computer simulations.  The objective of the applicant's research is to improve the current knowledge and physical understanding of the behaviour of flow around groups of bluff bodies and chimney stacks using wind tunnel experiments and computer modeling.

"Wheatgrass genus Elymus is within the same group as wheat, barley and rye. Grasses within this genus have adapted to various climates and habitats, making them valuable genetic resources for cereal and forage breeding as well as an excellent group for research in evolution, taxonomy, and speciation. All wheatgrasses are made up of at least two different sets of chromosomes with most species having the StY and StH chromosome combination. There are about 50 species with StH combination. The St genome comes from ancestor species in genus Pseudoroegneria and H from wild barley. One debate on this group has been whether different StH species arose by an ancient cross between the one pair of parents, a Pseudoroegneria species and a wild barley and then differentiated into a number of species (single origin), or different StH species arose by crosses between different pairs of the parents at different times and places (multiple origins). We will test whether the St and H genomes in Elymus are of multiple origins. It has been hypothesized that allopolyploid StY species may have an origin from autopolyploid (StStStSt) and the same genome differentiated gradually within the polyploid species resulting in today's StY genome allotetraploid Elymus. Our rpb2 data did not support the same origin of St and Y genome in StY species. Phylogenetic analysis of the StY species usig other genes will test whether StY species are allopolyploid origin. My study will be designed to test whether the St and H haplomes in StH species are of multiple origins, and characterize differences between cytogenetically distinct StH and StY species. Lastly, I shall test if StY genome species is allo- or autopolyploid origin and examine genetic relationships of the Y genome to other genomes in Triticeae. 

The outcome of our study will shed light on if interspecific hybridization is a more powerful and creative evolutionary process than envisioned by the early proponents of hybridization. This study will provide a phylogenetic framework for studying the evolutionary processes. Such findings also have agronomic relevance because of the many agriculturally useful species in Elymus.

"I have been interested in how humans brain process visual motion information and how vision is used in movement control.  In particular I am exploring the specific mechanisms that underlie motion perception, including both object motion (e.g., an oncoming car), and the motion of the visual environment experienced as a result of the observer's self-motion (e.g., walking and driving).  In order to conduct my behavioural research, I have developed a state-of-the-art virtual reality (VR) technology system.  What makes this approach revolutionary is that VR allows for the real-time manipulation of dynamic visual environments - something that is practically impossible to achieve in a real world scenario.  This research program has not only allowed me to explore fundamental perceptual principles underlying visuomotor control, but it can also be employed in the design of better standardized tests and training/rehabilitation for drivers/pilots and the design of car, road sign and driving/flight simulators.  

   Visual information is not the only source of information received when one navigates in an environment.  I have explored how visual and nonvisual (proprioceptive and vestibular) information is integrated during self-motion.  One project that I have developed involves creating novel, sensory conflict testing paradigms in which information from vision and body senses are simultaneously available during locomotion, yet specify different magnitudes of movement (e.g., simulating the sensory information experienced while walking on moving airport sidewalk). This type of experimental design allows me to assess the role of each sensory cue individually and to gain a better understanding of how these cues interact with each other. 

   In another project, I have also been able to manipulate the degree with which participants actively engage in movement during ""virtual"" navigation as a way of studying exactly how human navigators form a ""cognitive map"" and find their way around. This work has provided new insight to the nature of spatial memory by identifying the critical components of spatial learning that result in different types of spatial representations.

"The overall objective of this research proposal is to develop a catalog of statistical methods and computational tools for genetic studies of complex human disorders.  The proposed research focuses on two problems. 

   The primary concern motivating the first research component is the observed difficulty in replicating initial claims of gene discoveries in genetic studies. One main contributing factor is that the traditional estimates of gene-effect size are often grossly upward-biased due to selection of both significant results and competing genetic variants, leading to optimistic power and sample size calculations for the replication studies.  This ascertainment bias is also known as the Beavis effect or Winner's curse. The proposed research examine three statistical approaches, resampling-based, likelihood-based and Bayesian methods, designed to reduce the estimation bias without the necessity of an independent replicate sample.

   The second part of the research proposal concerns joint modeling of multiple correlated variables. In many genetic studies, the trait/disease of interest often cannot be characterized by one single variable of collected subjects; and there are situations in which the outcome of interest cannot be measured directly and a set of surrogate response variables must be used instead. The proposed research is motivated by a Cystic Fibrosis (CF) project that aims to map and isolate modifier genes influencing severity of the CF disease in CF patients. Manifest variables collected include a number of correlated clinical phenotypes. So far, the analyses of genotype/phenotype correlations have been exclusively univariate. The aim of the proposed research is to increase the efficiency of the study by jointly modeling the available correlated phenotypes through the latent variable model (LVM) methodology. 

   The development of the proposed methods and provision of relevant software packages will contribute significantly to the ultimate goal of gene and therapy discovery for complex human disorders.

"Stochastic filtering is concerned with estimating the conditional probability distribution of a signal through a sequence of partial and noisy observations of the signal. The filtering theory has generated a great deal of interest in recent years as it has found important applications in many areas of scientific research. Such areas include target detection and tracking, pollution tracking, communication networks, mathematical finance and quantum informational technologies, etc. This proposed research program is devoted to performing theoretical research in nonlinear filtering and related stochastic analysis.

    The martingale problem method is a basic method in the classical filtering theory. However, this method does not work well in all cases, especially when the signal processes are singular. Recently, we have made some progress on using Dirichlet form as a tool to investigate filtering of singular signals. We expect to use the Dirichlet form theory to further study various numerical approximations to the solutions of  the filtering equations and to investigate the long time behavior of the approximate filters. Moreover, we are interested in broadening the applications of the classical filtering theory by considering non-Markov signals and more general observation models. Also, we will continue working on some unsolved open problems in the area such as the stability of nonlinear fillers and the convergence of the combined parameter-state estimation algorithms.

    The success of this research program will promote the combination of filtering theory and stochastic analysis. On one hand, the use of stochastic analysis will help us solve some fundamental problems of non-standard filtering models. On the other hand, the investigation of filtering for more gerneral models will pose challenging problems for the theory of measure-valued processes and interacting particle systems. The solutions of these new problems will promote the further development of stochastic processes and applied probability. Moreover, applications of the theory and algorithms developed in this work will provide Canadian industry and military with stronger competitive ability in the world.

"There is a growing awareness that nanoscience and nanotechnology can have a profound impact on energy generation, storage, and utilization. Nanotechnology-based solutions are being developed for a wide range of energy problems such as: solar cells, hydrogen generation and storage, batteries, and fuel cells. Dr. Sun's research will apply nanotechnology to address challenges in fuel cells for clean energy.

The objectives of this research are to fabricate three-dimensional and highly efficient fuel cell electrodes by using nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube as supports for Pt nanoparticle electrocatalysts. We will develop methods to grow N-doped carbon nanotubes on carbon paper fuel cell backings and to deposit Pt nanoparticles on the nanotubes with controlled size and distribution as electrodes for PEM fuel cells.

"Cost and durability are two major roadblocks that have to be overcome before proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system can become economically viable. Current PEMFC technology still suffers from low platinum utilization, limited mass transport capability, and poor electrochemical stability of the carbon black-based support in the electrode structure. Therefore, novel electrode design, and development of a low cost and stable catalyst support to replace existing carbon support within membrane electrode assembly (MEA), will provide us the means to reduce the cost and performance gaps towards commercial viability. The objectives of the project are to apply a class of novel nanomaterials with special properties (high stability and electrical conductivity) to address significant challenges of high cost and low stability in fuel cells through a collaborative research between the applicants at The University of Western Ontario (UWO) and General Motors Canada Ltd (GM). The proposed research project is associated with fabrication and characterization of metal silicide nanowire supports, noble metal nanoparticles and their composites to obtain significantly improved properties and performance of the nanomaterials used in fuel cells for automotive applications. An important technical feature is to synthesize and use special low-dimensional nanomaterials based on metal silicide nanowires (e.g. TiSi2, TaSi2 and WSi2) with excellent thermal stability and corrosion resistance as well as extremely high electrical conductivity for use as catalyst supports. This innovative research project will take full advantage of the applicants' expertise in nanotechnology for clean energy. It is expected that the developed techniques could significantly lower cost and improve stability of fuel cells and could be transferred to GM's fuel cell products. GM and Dr. Sun at UWO will collaboratively approach these challenges through the creative and innovative applications of new nanomaterials. The successful completion of the proposed project will be of benefit to Canadian industry, UWO, and to the nanotechnology community by accelerating the fuel cell commercialization process and directly reducing environmental pollution.","Development of novel 3D metal silicide nanowires as electrocatalyst support for low cost and high durability PEM fuel cells","Materials sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Materials science and technology"

"Complementing existing methods for cancer detection (e.g., biochemical markers), which are only partially successful, our research aims to develop new techniques to use differences in mechanical properties of cells from body fluids (voided urine, pleural and peritoneal fluids) for disease detection (e.g., bladder cancer and breast cancer). Mechanical differences exist between normal and malignant cells. The use of mechanical differences for clinical applications is not yet clinically feasible because existing mechanical techniques suffer from a low characterization throughput. 



     We are developing innovative micro devices, parallel cell aspiration techniques, and automated measurement systems that will, for the first time, allow high-speed mechanical testing of cells. The system will generate statistically significant data on a large number of exfoliated/circulating cells from body fluids at a speed orders of magnitude higher than that of existing techniques. This research will quantitatively demonstrate the efficacy of 'biomechanical marker' for cancer detection. The novel, non-invasive, inexpensive diagnostic techniques promise a stand-alone or bolstering method for cancer diagnosis and surveillance. 



     This grant application is for a biological atomic force microscope (bio-AFM) that is capable of capturing both DIC images and force spectroscopy data on cells, an indispensable capability for classifying cell types and their cytomorphology and correlating to their Young's modulus values, since multiple cell types are always present in body fluids. The Young's modulus values characterized by bio-AFM will be highly useful to verify the results from our high-speed measurements. Thus, data collected from our new, high-speed technique can be convincing and appropriately interpreted. Additionally, this comparative theoretical and experimental approach will also contribute to unifying cell mechanical characterization results from different techniques.","A bio-AFM for mechanical characterization of biological cells","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Mechanical systems and instrumentation"
"Early and accurate cancer detection is of critical significance since it improves prognosis and simplifies treatment. In Canada, bladder cancer represents the 4th most common malignancy in men and the 8th most common in women. Progression to metastases is usually fatal. Because of its high recurrence rate, patients require continuous surveillance. The associated healthcare costs are greater than other malignancies.  Intensive efforts in the development of biochemical and genetic markers for bladder cancer detection have been only partially successful, largely due to the complexity and inherent cost of these tests. We propose to develop the novel concept of using 'biomechanical' and/or 'bioelectrical' markers for electromechanical characterization of single cells in voided urine. Mechanical and electrical characteristics of cells are known to be effective cues for cancer detection. However, their clinical relevance has not yet been assessed because existing techniques suffer from a very low characterization throughput. This project will develop new techniques, micro devices, and automated measurement systems that will, for the first time, allow high-speed electromechanical testing of exfoliated cells in voided urine. The high-speed systems will generate statistically and clinically significant data on a large number of cells within a reasonable time window. The project will quantitatively demonstrate the efficacy of biomechanical and bioelectrical markers for bladder cancer detection. These novel, non-invasive, relatively inexpensive diagnostic techniques will provide a stand-alone or bolstering method for bladder cancer diagnosis and surveillance.

"Diabetes is among the most important health care challenges worldwide. In Canada alone, two-three million

people have diabetes, of which 80% die as a result of diabetic complications such as heart disease. For diabetes

care, insulin administration through subcutaneous injection or insulin pumps is the most widely used method.

However, the persistence of vascular and other diabetic complications as the main cause of morbidity and

mortality calls for the improvement of insulin delivery technologies that allow for controlling insulin delivery

rates in real time based on time-varying glucose levels of individual patients.

Currently existing prototype systems that employ continuous glucose sensors in combination with insulin

pumps are not yet capable of providing safe and effective closed-loop insulin delivery. The cost of constructing

and maintaining such a delivery system is also rather high. Besides insulin delivery, the avoidance of severe

hypoglycemia that can lead to fainting, coma, and death, is also critically important to glucose control in

diabetes care. Severe hypoglycaemia occurs in diabetes because of defective release of insulin-counteracting

(counterregulatory) hormones, particularly glucagon.

In this project, glucose-responsive nano-hydrogels will be synthesized and integrated with MEMS

(microelectromechanical systems) structures to form new types of closed-loop insulin and glucagon delivery

devices. These compact micro devices will provide self-regulated insulin delivery to improve glucose control

and self-regulated glucagon delivery to avoid hypoglycemia in selected patients. Through design optimization

of MEMS structures and nano-hydrogel synthesis, improvement of glucose control and minimization of

hypoglycaemia in diabetic animals (rats) will be demonstrated, which will prompt further testing in large

animals and perhaps in humans.

Mechanical nanomanipulation promises specificity, precision, and programmed motion. Using a scanning

electron microscope (SEM) as the imaging platform provides visual feedback down to the nanometer level at

video rates as nanomanipulation occurs. Mechanical nanomanipulation might be used in combination with

chemistry-based assembly and dielectrophoretic nanomanipulation for large-scale nanomanufacturing.

"In this program, we will create lightweight multi-functional polymer nanocomposite materials that are suitable to replace metal or highly filled composites for electronics, aerospace, automotive and military applications. These nanocomposites will be based on a hybrid design, i.e. more than one nanofiller will be used and mixed with a polymer or with a blend of polymers. By controlling the structure, we propose to localize the nanofiller and thereby reduce filler loading and conseuntly, reduce the overall weight and cost of the nanocomposite. We will use both commmercially available and custom-designed nanoparticles and fibers to yield low weight, high performance materials with unique combinations of mechanical, electrical an thermal properties. In particular, our group has the capability to make high aspect ratio metal nanowires that can be used for nancomposites with application in electronics, and these nanowires can be combined with other nanofillers or macrofillers to fill requirements for example, in the automotive, aerospace and military sectors. Polymer nanocomposites display superior properties to their microcomposite counterparts because nanofillers (1-100nm dimension) are the same size as polymer molecules and therefore, can significantly alter the physical and chemical interactions with the polymer matrix. We will take advantage of this unique nanomaterial-polymer interface and design polymer nanocomposites incorporating nanowires or combinations of nanowires and other high aspect-ratio nanofillers like inorganic clays or carbon nanotubes. These materials are the subject of intense interest because they can be manufactured using conventional polymer processing techniques and there is significant potential to commercialize these materials in a large number of high-tech applications such as photovoltaics, biomedical, packaging, sensors, catalysis, fuel cells, solar cells and others. Our goal is to produce novel multi-filler hybrid nanocomposites with multifunctional properties with a significant market potential in the electronics, aerospace, automotive and military industries.

These distinctive combinations of different high aspect ratio conductive nanofillers can lead to polymer nanocomposites with improved electrical properties for applications requiring electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, electrostatic dissipation (ESD) and dimensional stability.



We will focus on hybrid nanomaterial based on MNW (eg. CuNW) coated with an ICP (eg. polyaniline, PAni). One of the major obstacles for using metal fillers in conductive polymer nanocomposites is oxidation. By coating with an ICP, we can take advantage of the high metal conductivity while still obtaining excellent nanostructured dispersions. We expect this type of morphology to provide outstanding electrical, mechanical and dimensional properties. We will also prepare CNT coated with ICP and pure ICP nanowires, and characterize morphology and test properties.

In addition to high temperature and wear resistance, these materials will target improvements in hysteresis, gas permeation, flammability resistance, thermal conductivity, rheology and explosive-decompression resistance. These improved properties will lead to increased pump life and use of progessive cavity pumps (PCPs) in these applications will provide for more energy-efficient and higher percentage oil recovery.

"Manganese is an important component of marine oxidation-reduction cycles because it exists in multiple redox states and is rapidly cycled between these states by bacterially mediated processes. The ease with which electrons are transferred between manganese species allows the manganese cycle to be readily coupled to other redox cycles. In nature, manganese exists in three oxidation states: Mn(II), Mn(III), and Mn(IV). Of these, Mn(III) has mostly been ignored. Different approaches to measuring manganese give contradictory information about the distribution of manganese dissolved in sediment pore waters that suggests that the suboxic part of the sediment contains not one but two soluble species, Mn(II) and Mn(III). The presence of Mn(III) in suboxic water and pore water can resolved several important issues. It would provide a mechanism for transferring dissolved Mn from sediment to water column; and it would provide evidence for a novel pathway in the nitrogen cycle whereby ammonia is oxidized directly to nitrogen gas by manganese. We propose to conduct a biogeochemical and microbiological study, in collaboration with researchers from two US universities, of the nature, stoichiometry, and rate of reactions that respectively produce and consume dissolved Mn(III). The study will be carried out in the St. Lawrence Estuary - Saguenay fjord environment for these reasons: 1)We have nearly 30 years worth of data on manganese in sediment and water column. 2) The sediments contain high concentrations of manganese, and manganese cycling is a dominant diagenetic process. 3) The solid phase manganese distribution is in steady state over decadal time scales, whereas the distribution of dissolved manganese is not. 4) The system provides excellent examples of low oxygen and high oxygen bottom waters that can help us compare and contrast end-member environments. 5) Many of the scientific questions we will investigate stem from previous work carried out in this system.

"The state of health of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a vast ecosystem on the east coast of Canada, has been declining for the last 70 years: there has been a steady decrease in availability of dissolved oxygen to the organisms that live in and use the sea floor and the deep bottom water. The bottom water originates in the slope region of the Western Atlantic Ocean. As this water journeys landward, respiration in water column and sediment consumes oxygen. The bottom water is isolated from the atmosphere, so the lost oxygen cannot be replaced except by slow diffusion from the overlying water. Today, the bottom water of the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary is severely hypoxic, a condition defined by oxygen levels lower than 20% of what is found in

water saturated with oxygen. Hypoxic bottom waters (less than 30% saturation) also exist in the head regions of the Anticosti and Esquiman Channels. We attribute one half to two-thirds of the declining oxygen levels to changes in the circulation pattern in the northwest Atlantic ocean, which determines the oxygen content of the water mass entering the deep Gulf environment. The remainder is attributed to the increased flux of organic matter to the sea floor. If oxygen levels in the Gulf of St. Lawrence continue to decline, today's hypoxic waters may become anoxic and the bottom environment may become a ""dead zone"". Even if we do not reach anoxia, progressively lower levels of oxygen may reduce the area of suitable habitats for many species of demersal and benthic animals, including fish and crustaceans. The proposed research addresses the strategic importance of

being able to understand and predict causes and effects of low dissolved oxygen levels in the Gulf of St. Lawrence ecosystem. The project further aims to develop remediation strategies, be they directed towards management of nutrient discharge via the St. Lawrence River or direct injection of oxygen into bottom waters.  The proposal combines field observations, laboratory experiments, and modelling, and its goal is to develop tools that can be used to predict future changes in the oxygen regime and the effects of these changes on ecosystem processes and fisheries resources.","Forcasting the response of a coastal ecosystem to persistent forcing: Hypoxia in the Gulf of St. Lawrence",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Earth-systems science"

"In Canada and other developed and developing countries, the use of herbicides has become very important in the preservation of sustainable agriculture, especially given our rapidly increasing population.  A widely used herbicide for broadleaf weed control is the quarternary nitrogen herbicide paraquat.  Paraquat is a fast-acting, non-selective compound that destroys tissues of green plants on contact and by translocation within the plant.  It is also known to be highly toxic in humans and animals and many cases of acute poisoning and death have been reported over the past few decades. Less than one teaspoon of paraquat, if ingested, is fatal.  The treatment against paraquat poisoning remains supportive with no antidotes or specific treatments available.   The primary injury caused by paraquat to mammalian systems occurs in the lung.  Recognizing that paraquat induces its toxic effects via the generation of reactive oxygen species (oxidative stress), research is mainly focused on the use of antioxidants as a treatment modality for paraquat toxicity.  So far, many natural antioxidants exhibit poor bioavailability and cannot easily cross biological barriers such as membranes. Administration of lipoic acid encapsulated in liposomes will increase the transfer and retention of the antioxidant within cells thus enhancing its cytoprotective effects against paraquat toxicity.  Liposomes are phospholipid vesicles composed of lipid bilayers enclosing an aqueous compartment. The relative ease in incorporating hydrophilic and lipophilic substances in liposomes, the possibility of directly delivering them to an accessible body site, and their low toxicity have rendered the liposomal system highly attractive for drug delivery.  We propose to develop and characterize a liposomal lipoic acid formulation and examine the mechanism(s) by which lipoic acid, either in its free or liposomal form, protects against paraquat-induced cytotoxicity.  We anticipate that the delivery of lipoic acid within liposomes will increase the levels of the antioxidant in the cells and subsequently further enhance its protective effects against oxidative stress-induced injuries.  It is envisioned that this preparation may be of clinical benefit in the treatment of paraquat toxicity.

A manufacturing system is considered to be automated if it is self-regulating and can operate relatively independent of human intervention.  Although automation reduces the need for human operators, it does not eliminate them altogether.  Machines will always need human supervision.  Automation enables a manufacturing system to produce a product with more consistent quality and at higher rates.  This leads to lower production costs and higher productivity.  Although automation necessitates a high capital investment, it is economically justified in many manufacturing environments.  It is believed that for Canadian manufacturers to stay competitive in today's global economy, increased levels of automation are a must for survival.



The long term goal of the applicant's research is the development and application of intelligent algorithms that advance the state of the art in the field of automatic control and manufacturing automation. ""Intelligent"" encompasses fuzzy logic, neural networks and neuro-fuzzy algorithms, algorithms that are said to mimic human reasoning. The short term objectives are to demonstrate advances with three specific applications: 1) force/velocity control of a pneumatic robot for contour tracking, 2) machine vision for automated parts inspection and 3) video-based monitoring of high speed assembly machines.



The work will involve the training of a minimum of three graduate students per year.  The students will contribute advanced knowledge of general interest to the manufacturing and controls research community, as well as provide new employees with advanced experience for the Canadian manufacturing industry.  The work is experimental in nature with simulation models developed in parallel for validation purposes.

"In our increasingly industrial and crowded society people are almost always working and living in the presence of unwanted noise.  The negative impact of this noise on processing information becomes more noticeable as individuals grow older, in part as a result of age-related hearing and vision loss.  In addition to these perceptual difficulties, older adults often report difficulty in remembering information.  Recent research has identified a link between perceptual processes such as hearing and vision and cognitive processes, such as memory and understanding conversations.  The studies outlined in this proposal are aimed at exploring the link between perceptual and memory processes in order to determine how much of the age-related cognitive differences can be traced to perceptual difficulties and how much should be attributed to other causes. The approach will be to measure, control, and manipulate encoding effort and determine its effect on memory performance.  To accomplish this, various amounts of visual and auditory noise will be added to stimuli and individual identification functions will be created.  Memory performance will be predicted from the identification functions.  Because of the complex interrelation of perceptual and cognitive factors, computer simulation models will be used to further describe the contributions of each factor. The data collected will help focus the research agenda on those factors that are critical to strategies to overcome the difficulties posed by growing older.  The long-term goal of these studies is to develop a formal, quantitative model of memory that will allow researchers and practitioners to pinpoint the areas of functioning that are critical to efficient cognitive processing.  Determining the causes of age-related cognitive declines will become more and more important in Newfoundland and Labrador as the percentage of the population over the age of 65 is projected by Statistics Canada to almost double by the year 2031.

"""Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution"". Theodosius Dobzhansky thus titled an essay to The American Biology Teacher in 1973. The statement can be taken to mean a number of different things. Dobzhansky meant to say that the biological world around us supports theories of evolution in a myriad of ways. Similarly, we cannot gain a clear understanding of the biological world around us without taking into account evolutionary relationships.



In the past two decades an enormous amount of data that pertains to evolutionary questions has been generated by large scale sequencing projects. From a statistical perspective, the setting is complex. Sequence data is high-dimensional, multivariate, discrete data. The parameter space of evolutionary trees is unusual as well. This application will implement increasingly realistic evolutionary models that incorporate things like structural energies of proteins, and the now well-accepted phenomenons of variation of rates of evolution over time and across genes. Statistical methods to assess uncertainty in evolutionary inferences will be developed and models and methods for making sense of data in the presence of lateral genetic transfers, as opposed to hereditary ones, will be pursued.

"Oceans and sufficiently deep lakes are stratified, meaning that their density increases with depth due to decreasing temperature and/or increasing salinity.  The region about which the density increase is largest is called the thermocline, which effectively represents an interface separating the surface and abyssal waters. Likewise, an atmospheric inversion denotes a locally strongly stratified region in the atmosphere where the temperature rapidly increases with height.  Stratified fluids generally inhibit vertical mixing.  Thus, for example, atmospheric pollutants tend to be trapped below an inversion.  However, energetic mixing and strong convective sources impinging upon density interfaces can result in the concentration and horizontal transport of pollutants which spread far from the initial disturbance.  Understanding the evolution of these so-called intrusions is the focus of this proposal.



Mixed-region collapse experiments will examine the evolution of a patch of uniform-density fluid as it spreads into the surrounding stratified ambient.  Convectively generated intrusions will be examined by situating a turbulent plume nozzle at the surface of a tank and directing the flow downwards into non-uniformly stratified fluid.  Both series of experiments will be performed in non-rotating and rotating frames of reference, the latter simulating the effects of the Earth's rotation.  Using a three-dimensional schlieren inversion technique recently developed by my group, internal waves generated by the intrusion will be measured non-intrusively and the relative energy associated with the waves will thus be determined.



The results will be compared with observations of oceanic thermocline mixing and will be used to improve the US Environmental Protection Agency model (also used by the Canadian government) for the dispersion of pollutants from sour gas flares.

All cells have the ability to self-destruct, a process called apoptosis. Apoptosis is controlled by various cellular factors, termed proteins, that are produced when needed - for instance when cells are starved of the nutrients upon which they depend for survival. These apoptosis-related proteins work in many different ways to shrink the cell, break it into pieces and ensure that the remnants are recycled by neighbouring, healthy cells. How the apoptosis-related proteins are triggered to carry out these tasks is an active area of research within the scientific community, and although many mechanisms have been identified, new ones are regularly emerging. We are interested in investigating how one potential apoptosis-controlling protein, RBM10, works. We propose that RBM10 is capable of boosting apoptosis and that it does this by changing the structure of various cellular factors, thereby changing their function. We plan to examine if and how RBM10 controls apoptosis, in the hopes of better understanding how cells, in general, regulate this very important process. Since the control of cell death is fundamental to many - if not all  - other processes within living organisms, the results of the proposed work have the potential to impact on a wide range of research areas.

"A fundamental aspect of memory is the ability to store and retrieve events in a context. Here context means linkages among where, when, and what events occurred. The human hippocampus has been strongly linked to these memory processes, termed episodic memory.We will explore versions of a new memory task involving one-trial Pavlovian learning that includes linkages among spatial and temporal contextual elements to evaluate episodic-like memory abilities in rats. We will determine the extent to which these tasks depend upon the integrity and plasticity of hippocampal circuitry. Finally, we will evaluate the extent of functional interconnection of hippocampus and related networks in episodic-like memory using a combination of behavioural activation of immediate early genes and selective neurotoxic damage. The results will clarify two poorly understood processes: episodic-like memory in nonhuman mammals and the neural systems processing that support it.

"The long-term objective of the proposed research program is to address charge transfer reactions that occur at interfaces. Understanding the chemistry at interfaces is an enormous challenge and there is a need to determine the kinetics, dynamics and forces involved. The fundamental chemistry occurring at an interface is critical to advancing numerous technologies including biosensors (i.e. early stage disease detection), designing novel molecular recognition strategies (i.e. drug:protein interactions) and optimizing organic material devices (i.e. Gratzel cells, organic field effect transistors, organic solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes). Charge transport in organic materials is the central theme in the design of new devices. Organic materials are attractive replacements for conventional inorganic materials because of their solution processability, ease of electronic or solubility tuning using synthesis and flexibility. Using solution processing, large area thin films are attainable, which could lead to dramatic cost reductions for organic photovoltaics. The proposed syntheses are built around thiophenes as hole transport material (p-type) and quinones as electron transport material (n-type). Initial synthetic targets include aromatic-fused thiophenes to develop better chromophores, with desired red-shifted absorbance to take utilize more of the solar spectrum to create excited states. Quinones are notoriously insoluble and we proposal to derivatize quinones to enhance solubility for material applications. 

In addition to the charge transfer of the bulk organic material, a key determinant in device performance is the nanostructured interface, where bulk material meets electrode. At this interface, all charges are collected or injected and surprisingly limited information is available concerning the energetics and dynamics of these processes. Using self-assembled monolayers of redox active molecules, the proposal will provide insight into the mechanism(s) of charge transport occurring at the interface. The findings should lead to optimization of charge collection or injection, which could immediately be applied to current organic devices to obtain higher performances and address issues of device longevity.","Organic charge transfer at interfaces","Materials sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Organic chemistry"

"At abundances of 1 to 100 million/mL, viruses are by far the most numerous ""lifeforms"" in the ocean; if placed end-to-end, viruses in the sea would stretch farther than the nearest 60 galaxies. They infect Avogadro's number cells per second, and are major players in mortality, biogeochemical cycling and structuring planktonic communities. Prokaryotes constitute most of the biomass in the world's oceans, and ~10 to 20 % of this biomass is lysed daily by viruses, resulting in 6 to 26 % of carbon fixed by phytoplankton passing through the viral shunt. In addition to their ecological and geochemical importance, viruses represent the greatest genetic diversity in the sea. The research outlined in this proposal is focused on understanding and quantifying the impact of viruses on marine planktonic systems, and characterizing their enormous genetic and biological diversity.

"My research concentrates primarily on the time evolution of microstructures formed under nonequilibrium conditions and is heavily based on the use of x-ray diffraction techniques.  Microstructures are central to the physical and mechanical properties of most materials.  Not only failure rates, but many other important properties including tensile strength, chemical reactivity and magnetic coercivity, depend crucially on this morphology. The typical length scales of these structures is micrometers.  Many of the advanced materials often denoted as ""modern space age"" materials get their properties from tailoring their microstructure by careful and sophisticated processing techniques.  Furthermore, it is an important fundamental problem in physics to understand both how such microstructures arise and how to characterize them.  Disordered and nonequilibrium systems span the range of materials including binary alloys (Ni3Al used for jet turbines) to directionally solidifying crystals (snowflakes) and to soft materials (plastic and rubber).  The nature of coherence and correlations in these systems is still not fully understood. Techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy allow scientists to study these systems, but real-time in-situ x-ray measurements, i.e.  time resolved scattering, allow measurements of the microstructure under conditions similar to conventional processing and therefore are ideally suited for these studies.

"A vast number of problems of economic and scientific interest involve sequences of actions where the effects of one action influence the expected utility of subsequent actions.  These sequential decision problems include such diverse applications as inventory management, the control of robots and industrial processes, playing backgammon, and planning under uncertainty, all of which are made more challenging because of their sequential and stochastic aspects.  Many problems in robotics and artificial intelligence are also of this nature, as indeed are most of the decision-making and planning problems faced by people and animals in their daily lives.  Reinforcement learning is a new body of theory and techniques for solving such sequential decision processes, based on classical methods such as dynamic programming and inspired by animal learning theory, that enables larger and more diverse problems to be solved.  The objectives of my research are to create new methods for reinforcement learning that remove some of the limitations on their widespread application, and to develop reinforcement learning as a model of intelligence that could approach human abilities.

"Precast concrete construction is a well established construction method that provides high-performance and long-lasting structures. A rating system for construction was developed in the USA called Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) that promotes sustainable construction. One of the credits under the 70 point Canadian LEED program is given for durable building envelopes. Precast construction usually rates well within the LEED system, however to improve it even further, durable reinforcing materials should be used.

Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars are non-corrosive and non-magnetic. This proposal will elaborate on the challenges and advantages of using FRP in precast concrete construction. The use of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement in precast construction will also contribute to producing durable and hence sustainable structures.

Before the long-term objective can be achieved, research is needed in several areas, design codes being the most important.  Even though current FRP design codes have been in use for nearly a decade, some areas of design still require further research attention. One of these areas is shear design. Especially shear design of FRP prestressed girders have not been thoroughly investigated. The provisions of CSA S6-06, CSA S806-02 and ACI 440.4R-04 will be examined and their applicability to FRP prestressed  I-girders will be validated. According to literature, FRP prestressed sections may fail in shear cracking plane due to tendon rupture by dowel action. As shear failures are very brittle, this needs to be avoided, for example by providing minimum stirrup spacing. None of the above mentioned codes provide stirrup spacing for FRP prestressed/reinforced members. It is essential that safe stirrup spacing requirements are developed for FRP reinforced/prestressed concrete beams.

"The atoms of all elements are composed of electrons orbiting a tiny massive core, the atomic nucleus.  The nucleus is, in turn, composed of still smaller objects called protons and neutrons or, collectively, nucleons.  These nucleons interact with each other by all of the known forces of nature, making the atomic nucleus an ideal ""laboratory"" for studying a wide range of topics of basic scientific interest, from the properties of the fundamental interactions of subatomic particles to how the nucleus as a whole behaves as a collective entity.  To date, the use of the atomic nucleus as a laboratory for basic science research has been constrained by the small subset of the possible combinations of protons and neutrons (isotopes) found in nature.  A great expansion of this field of science is, however, being made possible by the development of research facilities such as the Isotope Separator and Accelerator (ISAC) at the TRIUMF laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia.  ISAC produces world-record intensities of short-lived isotopes and delivers them to research scientists in the form of high-quality ion beams.  In the present research, the high-frequency light (gamma rays) emitted when rare isotopes produced at ISAC decay or interact with other nuclei will be measured in state-of-the-art detector arrays known as the 8pi Spectrometer and TIGRESS, which have been designed and constructed by a collaboration of researchers from Canadian universities and TRIUMF.  These measurements will support a broad program of basic science research, ranging from precision measurements of the weak interactions of subatomic particles called quarks to searches for the new interaction(s) required to account for the observed imbalance between matter and anti-matter in the universe, from studies aimed at a better understanding of how the chemical elements were synthesized in the explosions of stars to those trying to unravel how the atomic nucleus responds to the stresses of unusual neutron-to-proton ratios.  The world leading combination of the ISAC facility and the sophisticated detection systems employed in these studies, will ensure that Canadian scientists remain at the forefront of the emerging field of rare isotope research.","Gamma-ray spectroscopy at the isotope separator and accelerator (ISAC)","Physical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Nuclear physics"

This research should help develop an appropriate chemistry control strategy under oxygenated supercritical conditions in a CANDU SCWR and reduce the exploitation costs for power equipment, both for the SCWR pressure tube and for non-nuclear components, such as turbine blades.

"As information and communication systems become increasingly complex, there is a growing need for the development of efficient algorithmic tools for the design, maintenance and management of such systems, especially decentralized networks like the Internet and high-speed telecommunication networks. This research program will investigate the algorithmic questions that arise in such settings, focusing on two main problems: 

(a) The design of protocols that need to function in the presence of self-interested agents (e.g., autonomous subnetworks on the Internet). In such settings, the task of algorithm-design is complicated by the fact that the data relevant to the problem is often controlled by self-interested agents. Consequently, one needs to elicit this data by cleverly incentivizing the users so that self-interested behavior leads to desirable outcomes. We shall focus on the development of techniques for the design and analysis of such efficient ""manipulation-resistant'' mechanisms. A particular emphasis will be to identify ways for ""exporting'' algorithms into manipulation-resistant mechanisms, and thus contribute to the field of algorithmic mechanism design.

(b) Decision-making under uncertainty. Uncertainty is a facet of many decision environments, and for effective decision making, one needs to consider models that explicitly incorporate the uncertainty. One of the broad objectives of our research is to explore models that abstract such settings, and devise methods for solving the algorithmic problems that arise in such models. We shall study key algorithmic problems that capture the underlying difficulties in such settings, and develop techniques that will find use in a variety of settings.  



In many cases, the algorithmic problems encountered are computationally intractable, and our approach will be to devise an approximation algorithm for the problem, that is, a polynomial-time algorithm that always delivers a provably near-optimal feasible solution. Approximation algorithms are a common thread in our research, and our research will also further the development of techniques for the design and analysis of these algorithms.

"This research program is aimed at understanding one of the most basic biological processes, cell division. The study of cell division, or the cell cycle, is the study of how cells increase their numbers through replicating their DNA and cellular contents, and segregating these into two equal daughter cells. In multicellular organisms like humans or fruit flies, cell divisions during development produce the millions of cells that make up the adult. The basic cell cycle is composed of several layers of regulation by a large number of proteins that work together to ensure proper execution of events at the right time. These proteins are conserved between very different organisms, and patterns of regulation are similar in most cells. However, in the development of a complex organism, not all cell cycles are the same, and many are in fact quite different from the standard cell cycle. The fruit fly, Drosophila has been an ideal model organism for studying relatively complex processes that are difficult to study in other higher organisms. Our lab is using Drosophila to understand how the cell cycle is controlled in a particularly complex and specialized cell cycle, the female meiotic cell cycle. Female meiosis is the sequence of cell divisions that occur in the making of an egg. The cell cycles of female meiosis are unique in that they lack many of the regulatory mechanisms that are used by the typical cell cycle, and instead rely on a number of specialized cell cycle regulators and on a retooling of the standard regulators. We use techniques in genetics and biochemistry to identify the unique regulators of female meiosis. Our study of female meiosis-specific cell cycle regulators provides evidence of a sophisticated spatial regulation of the cell cycle that appears to exist as compensation for the absence of other means of cell cycle regulation. We are studying how this spatial control is brought about and how the temporal control of cell cycle progress interfaces with this additional level of control. These studies will provide insight into the complex controls that regulate the most basic of biological processes, cell division.","Spatial and temporal control of the meiotic cell cycle","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Developmental genetics"

"The shade avoidance response of plants is considered to be an adaptive, plastic response that increases the probability of successful reproduction in natural environments. Within an agricultural environment, this shade avoidance response should also enable crop species to be more competitive with weeds. However, shade avoidance may be expressed at a cost to reproductive fitness. No study has been conducted previously to associate shade avoidance as a mechanism to explain the outcome of crop and weed competition. Therefore, to explore the role of shade avoidance in crop-weed interactions, we propose the following three objectives: (1) to mathematically define a plasticity index of phenotypic variation within selected crop germplasm in response to changes in light quality; the intent of this objective is to predict crop field performance under weedy conditions, (2) to determine the cost of shade avoidance, as measured by crop yield or as a loss of phenotypic plasticity to subsequent abiotic stresses, and (3) to discover key metabolic and signaling pathways associated with weed-induced shade avoidance in corn. These objectives will be addressed under field and laboratory conditions. This project will generate new knowledge pertaining to the physiological and molecular response of selected crop species to stress caused by early weed competition. This new knowledge will be of direct use to public and private crop breeding programs throughout Canada and North America. We anticipate that knowledge generated from these studies will be used to develop new, more weed tolerant crop hybrids and varieties. The commercialization of this technology will improve net on-farm income, reduce pesticide loading into the environment, and thereby be of direct benefit to the rural economy of Canada.","Characterizing phenotypic variation, physiological costs, and global gene expression associated with shade avoidance in selected crop species","Agriculture and primary food production",CANADA,CANADA,"Plant growth and development"
"Competition between crop and weed has been regarded traditionally as a struggle for resources such as light, water and nutrients.  The physiological mechanism by which weeds cause yield losses in crops is understood poorly.  Early detection of neighbouring plants through the red-to-far red (R:FR ) ratio may be an important mechanism affecting plant to plant competition.  Crop plants can detect changes in the R:FR ratio caused by the presence of neighbouring weeds and as a result will grow initially taller, with less branching and less root development.  This shade avoidance response may delay phenological development and come at a cost to reproductive fitness.  No study has been conducted previously to associate the early detection of the R:FR ratio as a mechanism to explain the outcome of crop and weed competition.   In this study, I propose to explore the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in the shade avoidance response of corn and soybean caused by the presence of weeds. Preliminary research has identified a wide range in corn and soybean germplasm phenotypic response to R:FR ratio reflected from the leaf surface of weeds.  I plan to use this within crop variation to explore the following hypotheses:  Objective 1: to determine if corn hybrids and soybean cultivars differing in response to R:FR are  constrained phenotypically during their development and  perform suboptimally in terms of biomass accumulation.  Objective 2: to determine if corn hybrids and soybean cultivars differing in response to R:FR experience a similar cost of shade avoidance, as measured by  a loss of phenotypic plasticity to subsequent abiotic stresses or expressed as yield loss.  Objective 3:  to discover if alterations exist in key metabolic and signalling pathways associated with weed-induced shade avoidance in corn hybrids and soybean cultivars that differ in their response to R:FR ratio.  New knowledge generated from this study will be used by plant breeders to develop more stress tolerant corn hybrids and soybean cultivars.

"The broad objective of the research proposal is the development of statistical methodology with a focus on computation in Bayesian settings.



In the application of clustering, I am interested in the implementation of Bayesian versions of various long-standing deterministic clustering procedures such as hierarchical algorithms and partitioning algorithms. Whereas the deterministic approaches provide the same terminal partition in every analysis of a dataset, the proposed Bayesian versions take into account the stochastic nature of data. Through repeated clustering on subject characteristics (i.e. parameters), probabilistic statements regarding clustering can be made, and specifying the uncertainty in partitions is valuable in many contexts. Additionally, Bayesian versions require the input of prior beliefs concerning aspects of clusters. Prior knowledge is often available, and a formal treatment of prior knowledge is desirable. Furthermore, our Bayesian versions of clustering can conveniently handle both multiple and missing measurements.



Statistical methodology will also be developed in the areas of biostatistics and statistics in sport. As an example of the latter, a new handicapping system is being proposed for use by the Royal Canadian Golf Association (RCGA). Retaining the use of both course and slope ratings, the new handicapping system strives for ease of interpretation and improved fairness in tournament settings.

"All nervous system functions in animal are controlled by networks of brain cells which communicate through specialized structures termed 'synapses'.  Perturbation of synaptic transmission between neurons is the basis for all brain dysfunctions.  Traditionally, it was presumed that the synaptic transmission occurred between a presynaptic neuron and its postsynaptic target involving a bipartite synapse.  However, recent studies have indicated that the glial cells - which were previously thought to provide physical support to neurons only - play many important functional roles in the nervous system.  For instance, in their absence not only do neurons fail to reach out to their exact targets but also that their synaptic transmission fails.  The precise involvement of glia in these processes and the underlying mechanisms remain however largely unknown.  Using a model system approach, this study will provide the direct evidence vis-ï¿½-vis the involvement of glial in nerve guidance towards its targets and also their precise role in synaptic physiology.  We believe that these studies will provide direct insights into the mechanisms by which glia affect nervous system development and function under both normal various and pathological conditions.","Glia-neuron interactions: roles in axonal pathfinding and synaptic physiology in an invertebrate model","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Cell biology"

"Macromolecular crystallography, central to structural biology, has now matured into a technique routinely used to solve 3D macromolecular structures. Currently, finding the right conditions for growing macromolecule crystals limits our progress. Macromolecular crystallization is a trial and error process that often relies on crystallization conditions derived from previous successful experiments. However, as we are still far from understanding the crystallization process, testing a small set of crystallization conditions is not guaranteed to lead to success. Large-scale screening of crystallization conditions (1000-3000) considerably increases the probability of finding the right conditions for macromolecular crystal growth, since a larger number of experimental parameters can be tested. Tracking the outcomes of such a large number of crystallization experiments requires an automated imaging platform that can inspect each crystallization condition at regular time intervals. A dozen investigators whose research programs all depend on macromolecular structure determination will benefit from access to an imaging platform. The latest features in available instrumentation are embodied in the CrystalPro platform: a large temperature range for temperature-sensitive crystal growth experiments, UV/Vis fluorescence and image recognition for crystal identification, remote access capability, and screening of up to different 12,000 crystallization conditions. This platform will not only permit the researchers to pursue projects of increasing complexity, but more importantly, it will enable them to rapidly identify successful crystallization conditions very early in the structure determination process, a critical condition for pursuing a structural biology research program. The platform will offer the researchers increased capacity for determining new structures that will answer questions of biological importance. These structures will greatly advance our understanding of how macromolecules function at the molecular level.","Macromolecular crystallization facility","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,Biochemistry

It will specifically address the problem of whether Earth's crust formed in large, episodic bursts of magma from deep within the mantle, or rather more continuous outpourings of magma as might be expected from the modern style of plate tectonics that we see on Earth today.  Issues of crust formation are linked inextricably to processes promoting the development of early life; for example the existence of large stable land masses would have allowed terrestrial and shallow water platforms for early organisms.

   I will determine the age and isotopic composition of minerals that retain the memories of how and when the crust formed using instrumentation that drills out pieces of the minerals with a laser beam and transports them to a mass spectrometer for analysis.  The work will be carried out at various locations in Labrador, around the world-class nickel-copper-cobalt ore deposit at Voisey's Bay, along the coast north of Nain, which contains wonderful three dimensional exposures of rocks, and at Mistastin Lake, which was formed by a meteor impact, bringing rocks to the surface that would not otherwise be accessible for study in this area.  The minerals will be separated from a variety of types of ancient rocks, and from modern sediments eroded from the ancient rocks by glaciers and streams.  Two of the minerals of interest, zircon and baddeleyite, are hard and not easily destroyed by erosion. The diversity of sampling locations and rock types will provide the best chance of providing a complete picture of the nature and characteristics of the magmatic events that formed the Labrador crust. The approach could be used as a template for similar studies of ancient crust formation elsewhere.

   This work has the potential to spur the interest of other academic researchers and mineral exploration companies to invest time and new resources in Labrador, which is vital for the sustainable development of this region.

"Chirality is a key factor in the efficacy of many drugs and agrochemicals. In addition, complex compounds such as hydroxylated heterocyclic aromatics and flavonoids are regarded as very promising for the prevention and treatment of cancers and cardio-vascular diseases. Plants are currently the major source for these chemicals, but the synthesis of novel derivatives exhibiting improved biological properties is often difficult or impractical. Furthermore, in the context of the green chemistry concept, new more selective and more environmentally friendly approaches to manufacture these biologically specific fine chemicals will be required. This includes the use of biocatalysts to catalyze stereospecific reactions. In the present proposal we will focus on the biochemical properties of the biphenyl dioxygenase (BPDO), which catalyses the stereospecific dioxygenation of biphenyl to generate a cis-dihydrodiol metabolite. The substrates for BPDOs include many benzene or diphenyl skeletons, whose hydrogens are substituted with either methyl, ethyl, vinyl, carboxyl, halogenated or nitro groups. It can also oxygenate to cis-diol bicyclic- or tricyclic-fused heterocyclic aromatics such as quinoline, dibenzofuran and phenanthridine. Understanding how the BPDO catalytic pocket interacts with the substrate (and substrate analogs) to bind them and orient them into the catalytic pocket and understanding the mechanisms by which the enzyme can evolve to enhance its specificity toward new substrate analogs will help design novel biocatalysts useful in biotechnological processes for the destruction of persistent pollutants or biocatalytic processes for green production of chemicals. The objectives of this proposal are to pursue with some of the basic investigations:  A- regarding the biochemistry of the BPDO to get a better insight about the mechanism of catalytic activity and B- regarding the dynamics of BPDO evolution, answering specific questions about the protein domains and amino acid residues representing the major determinants of substrate specificity, regiospecificity and stereospecificity and how they interact with the substrate.

"Movement can be prioritized based on needs for metabolic economy (cost of transport, muscle efficiency) and for mechanical performance (work and power output). Our objectives are to understand how mechanical performance can be enhanced and how mechanical and energetic aspects of performance interact in different types of movements and animals. This research integrates measurements from whole animals, isolated tissue and computer modeling to tackle these questions. 1) How do compliant/elastic structures improve mechanical performance and alter the energetic cost of moving. We developed a computer simulation of a muscle (whose properties we can define to match any muscle we choose) attached to a load (animal) through a compliance (tendon). We are probing the multitude of ways by which power/work may be increased by altering the characteristics of tendons and aspects of contraction. Further, we recently developed a real-time system where a living muscle powers computer simulated movement via a high speed interface. This retains the realism of complex contractions from living muscle and allows direct measurement of the energy (oxygen) used by muscle. We will determine how compliant structures alter the efficiency of muscle contraction and the economy of movement. 2) What functions are ascribed to muscles in swimming fish? We are establishing an understanding of its complexity in various fish, and are the first to investigate the roles of economy and manoeuvrability. This entails measures of muscle activation and strain in swimming fish, work and power from isolated muscle, and energy consumption by fish and muscle. 3) How do genotypic based alterations in muscle through artificial selection for high activity in mice impact efficiency of contraction and how does this bear on whole animal performance? With Ted Garland (UC Riverside), we demonstrated dramatic shifts in mechanical power and fatigue resistance of muscles in these mice. We propose to measure efficiency of contraction in these muscles to understand its relationship with the selection paradigm. This is a rare opportunity to study a potential direct trade off between power and efficiency in an organism under selection.","Efficiency and mechanical performance of muscles","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal physiology and metabolism"

"Biological membranes are complex liquid-crystalline fluid materials of orientationally ordered proteins, peptides and lipids. The physical and structural properties of biological membranes are not only influenced by the type and composition of lipids, but also by the proteins/peptides within the membranes. For example, proteins and peptides can mediate membrane destabilization, which is an essential process for cell-to-cell membrane fusion, vesicle transport, antimicrobial activity, and virus proliferation. Therefore, a thorough analysis of membrane/protein interactions has broad implications for molecular cell biology.

The mechanisms of membrane destabilization by peptides are not well understood. For example, it has been suggested that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) could destabilize membranes by forming a carpet on the surface or holes within the membrane. It is not clear from the secondary structure or the amino acid sequence why one mode is preferred over the other. Other peptides with similar secondary structure, such as the competence stimulating peptides or type I antifreeze proteins, do not penetrate or destabilize membranes. In fact, antifreeze proteins seem to stabilize membranes. Another example is fusion peptides, which are very effective at destabilizing model membranes and causing lipid mixing - a presumed precursor to membrane fusion. The fusion peptides p14 and p15 from the fusion associated small transmembrane protein family are anchored to the membrane via an N-terminal myristoyl group. The p14 peptide, like all other fusion peptides, is slightly hydrophobic and is suspected to surface associate with the target membrane. The p15, on the other hand, is atypically hydrophilic, and apart form the N-terminal, has been shown not to strongly interact with model membranes. Yet, all peptides are very effective at destabilizing membranes.

I hypothesise that peptides may affect membrane stability by disrupting the ordered water layer above the membrane. This project is part of a larger program to detail the initial stages of membrane destabilization by investigating intermolecular interactions responsible for structural modifications of membranes.

"My proposed research lies in the fields of combinatorics and combinatorial optimization. The problems I aim to study fall into four general categories; (1) positional games, (2) combinatorics of linear programming, especially the model of unique sink orientation of hypercubes, (3) theory of sparse quasirandom graphs, and (4) extremal combinatorial problems of various kinds. I study these questions from different points of view, considering both combinatorial and algorithmic aspects. Positional games are two player games of perfect information, that are strongly related to the concepts of randomization and derandomization in computer science. We aim to find and describe winning strategies for important classes of games. Our investigation is often guided by probabilistic intuition and particular strategies frequently provide algorithmization of related algorithms.

Linear programming (LP) is probably the single most frequently solved computational task in computers today. It involves maximizing or minimizing a linear function, such that the solution satisfies a set of given linear constraints. There exists a variety of algorithms that solve LP very fast in practice. Despite their practical success there are interesting theoretical open questions mostly surrounding the geometry and combinatorics of linear programming. I plan to study some of these questions; an advance on them could have practical consequences down the road.

A graph is called quasirandom if some of its properties resemble those of truly random graphs. I intend to construct new quasirandom graphs with useful properties. Explicit constructions of quasirandom graphs are potentially helpful in

computer science where they can save (expensive) random bits, or in combinatorics where their imperfect randomness might be crucial in providing solutions to extremal problems, studied under category (4).

"The objective of this project is to develop methods for analysis of iterative (the so-called ""turbo"") processing employed in digital receivers as a mean to yield close-to-optimal performance, i.e. almost-error-free communication in adverse conditions. The timeliness of this proposal is due to ever-growing importance of digital communications integrating profoundly the modern life. New technological solutions are ""a must"" to yield cost-effective products, so research efforts are continuously deployed to design digital transceivers. This research is related to the invention of the so-called turbo-codes, whose break-through idea of iterative processing was quickly extended on many applications. Using the ""turbo"" principle, the receiver is divided into relatively small blocks (devices) processing the data locally, and exchanging the reliability signals iteratively to approach the globally optimal processing. The reason behind the growing interest in turbo processing is that it yields close-to-optimal solutions with manageable complexity, bringing the performance of practical receivers close to its theoretical limits. It is, therefore, important to analyze theoretical and practical aspects of the iterative algorithms and study their applications.  



Currently, various ""turbo"" algorithms are being proposed but the tools to analyze them formally are scarce. This is because the iterative processing is highly non-linear and resists formal analysis in a majority of cases which significantly limits the researchers' capacity to devise new receivers. This provides motivation for our research. Our objective is to devise analytical or semi-analytical tools to obtain probabilistic models of messages exchanged between the constituent devices of the receiver, with benefits such as simple and optimal design, as well as adaptation of the receivers to the time-varying channel conditions.



The funding will be used to support graduate students and to disseminate the research results.

"Groups are present in almost any form of Mathematics, as they are associated to the fundamental notion of symmetry. 



The building blocks of all groups having finitely many elements are the finite simple groups. One of the most celebrated achievements of Mathematics was the complete classification of all finite simple groups. Except for a few sporadic cases -which where last to be found- and two other families, all other finite simple groups turn out to be groups of Lie type. These are algebraic analogues of important geometric objects called Lie groups.



When studying a group, one often looks at various of its concrete images, say by matrices, that is, one studies group ``representations"". These tend to offer  different points of views of the same group, and provide information that is sometimes harder to obtain from the group itself.



Now all finite groups of Lie type possess a distinguished representation, called Steinberg representation, which reflects in a rich and subtle way the structure of the group. 



I investigate this Steinberg representation, not only in its original version, using complex numbers, but also in a less understoon version, its so called ``modular reduction"", trying to unlock some its misteries. For instance, in its ordinary version, the Steinberg representation cannot be decomposed into smaller representations, but in its modular version, it is not at all clear how to decompose the Steinberg representation into its irreducible constituents, what these are, or even how many are there. These matters tend to depend not only on delicate properties of the specific group of Lie type in question, but also on the prime used in the reduction.

"In a recent Psychological Review article, ""Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder as a Disturbance of Security Motivation,"" Szechtman and Woody (2004) outlined a theory regarding the psychopathology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). They proposed that a dysfunctional negative feedback in a security-motivation system (SMS) fails to shut-down the activated motivation, resulting in perseveration of security-related species-typical behaviours, thereby generating a profile of behaviour characteristic of OCD symptoms. This theory makes an important contribution to the theme of conceptualizing psychopathologies as dysfunctions of normal motivations, and has been extended recently by others to encompass variations in development of normal non-pathological behaviour including cultural rituals [Boyer, P. & Lienard, P. (2006). Why ritualized behavior? Precaution systems and action parsing in developmental, pathological and cultural rituals. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 2006]. The theory also makes a more subtle contribution to science but one which potentially could be of great importance. Specifically, it introduces and develops the concept of a biologically evolved ""security-motivation,"" a special motivation present in animals but distinct from other motivations in having some unique characteristics. However, security-motivation is not an established entity in psychology. In the present project, I will focus on the concept of ""security-motivation"" and attempt to assess experimentally whether a security-motivation system exists.

"The usual method to understand the structure of large networks (such as communication networks, or neural networks, etc...) goes by randomly sampling some type of information that we are able to analyze. The main questions are: ""What type of information do we need to sample?"" and ""How do we extract information about the whole network?"" The present research proposal suggests a new approach. We assume that the networks grow for an infinite amount of time and then we apply analytic methods for the limit object.

We study a deep mathematical theory which, amongst other things, allows one to model these growing networks. This theory links many subjects such as ergodic theory, combinatorics, probability theory, arithmetic combinatorics. It leads to proofs of mathematical theorems in a surprisingly broad range of areas.

"The proposed research is focused on on-line learning and sequential decision making in stochastic environments. Examples of sequential decision making problems abound: controlling industrial plants, performing clinical trials, managing investments, monitoring pipeline-systems, etc. An on-line learning algorithm improves the performance of a system during its normal operation. In contrast, off-line learning algorithms are trained with a fixed amount of data and then used with learning turned off. In off-line learning the training data has to be fully representative of the system's behaviour or performance may be poor. On-line learning systems overcome this potential weakness because they never stop adapting. 



On-line learning is challenging since learning and control is interleaved. Current on-line learning solutions are limited to small finite domains or make strong assumptions (such as that the uncertainty is parametric) that seriously limit their applicability since complex environments do not meet this conditions.



Here I propose to develop and study on-line learning algorithms that work in large, complex environments. I plan to concentrate on the following aspects: (i) Understanding what makes efficient on-line learning possible, (ii) characterizing the behaviour of on-line learning algorithms, (iii) developing on-line learning algorithms that are efficient in terms of both data and computation. In order to accomplish this goal, I analyse the performance of the algorithms theoretically, deriving bounds that show their strengths and reveal their weaknesses, followed by an effort to improve their weakest points. 



Although delivering good on-line performance in large-scale, realistic environments is an ambitious goal, progress on this area is likely to find significant future, real-world applications.

"Mammalian receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are the high affinity cell surface receptors for many growth factors, cytokines and hormones. Approximately 20 different RTK classes have been identified. Most RTKs are single, glycosylated subunit receptors but some for example, the insulin receptor exist as multimeric complexes. When a growth factor binds to the extracellular domain of an RTK, its dimerization is triggered with other adjacent RTKs. Dimerization leads to a rapid activation of the receptor's cytoplasmic kinase domains. The activated receptor then becomes autophosphorylated on multiple specific intracellular tyrosine residues. Although the signaling pathways of RTKs are well characterized, the parameters controlling dimerization and the interactions between the receptors and their ligands still remain poorly defined. For nerve growth factor (NGF) TrkA receptors, glycosylation is required to localize the receptor to the cell surface where glycosylation was suggested to prevent receptor autophosphorylation Indeed, glycosylation of cell membrane bound  RTKs may be an important requirement for their transport and function. For an example, partial glycosylation is an important requirement for at least the processing and/or hormone-binding activity of RTK insulin receptor, and epidermal-growth-factor receptor. To date, the precise role of RTK glycosylation in receptor activation is unknown. Here, we discover a direct link between Trk glycosylation and receptor activation following natural ligand interaction (Woronowicz et al., Glycobiology 17:10-24, 2007). Our recent preliminary data indicate that ligand binding to Trk as well as epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) and insulin receptors induces lysosomal  Neu1 sialidase activity which influences the receptor desialylation and, consequently, the induction of RTK activation. These observations suggest for the first time that RTK activation is regulated by lysosomal Neu1 sialidase induction, and thus we identify a critical parameter involved with ligand binding to RTKs, which has not been previously observed. Neu1 sialidase may be a common master enzyme regulating the process of dimerization and activation of RTK receptors.

"This program concerns the theory of integrable partial differential equations used in modeling nonlinear waves.  The focus is on special classes of solutions describing sharply peaked waves

called peakons.  Peakons exhibit robust properties even when they collide, in particular they preserve their shapes, making them analogous to smooth soliton waves. The mathematical properties of these waves are fascinating; the non-smooth character of these waves forces us to use highly singular objects in their description.  At the same time, the very same mathematics is showing us that these objects have a lot in common with very classical mechanical systems like a beads-on-a string system used to study the eigenvibration problem and its generalizations.  



This program will continue to develop methods to analyze the mathematical foundations 

of such non-smooth waves as well will look into applications of the developed methods to inverse problems in geophysics, most notably to the magnetotelluric inverse problem, the subject of which is to map the conductivity profile of the Earth, based on surface measurements of the electric and magnetic fields.  It is believed that the developed methods will be applicable to other systems with similar inverse problems.  In particular anticipated applicability of the proposed machinery to the inverse vibrating beam problem is expected to be of significance in mechanical engineering and geophysical inverse problem.

"The abundance of texts on the Internet makes exciting research projects in computational linguistics possible. Texts need to be interpreted intelligently and affordably, but sometimes more costly processing leads to linguistically more satisfying results. Certain properties of texts require deep processing, even if they can to some extent be discovered with simpler methods. A case in point is sentiment analysis, a new and active area of research. The results have been the strongest in recognizing polarity (e.g., positive/negative movie reviews); sometimes a neutral case is included (e.g., buy stock, sell stock, do nothing). The intensity of opinion has been studied too. All these phenomena are instances of subjectivity in language. In recognizing subjective expressions or classifying texts by opinion values, researchers often apply supervised and slightly primed unsupervised machine learning. The former depends on the availability of annotated lexical resources, whose necessarily manual creation is labour-intensive and obviously subjective.



My research has dealt, and will continue to deal, with subjectivity. The language of electronic negotiations contains elements that can predict success or failure, such as expressions of the negotiator's attitude. Short story summarization is a challenging new variation of my work on automatic summarization of news items. Fiction, with its subjective nature, requires methods different than news: complex syntactic and semantic information, including indicators of subjectivity. All my work relies on statistical language processing and on symbolic techniques which include full parsing and linguistically motivated heuristics; this dual strategy will be kept in the proposed research. Work on the language of negotiation will continue once new relevant text data become available. Short story summarization will go on, with much more emphasis on subjectivity. Summarization of news articles will evolve in a novel direction: constructing summaries of multiple documents with varying viewpoints and opinions. Work has also begun on recognizing certain types of opinions in blogs.

"This discovery grant will explore a new scheduling algorithm which can achieve near-perfect Quality of Service (QoS) over general packet-switched networks and infrastructure-based Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). The Internet has had an unprecedented impact on society over the last two decades. Compared to other disruptive technologies such as radio, telegraph, telephone, television, and the personal computer, the Internet has had one of the fastest adaptation times to reach the majority of the North American households. The outlook for new services over the Internet is tremendous, and these include telemedicine, telerobotic systems and Intelligent Highway System.

"The applicant's research interests lie in the study of atomic and molecular interactions and dynamics by optical techniques, namely various light scattering and absorption processes. This is a complete investigation in that there are experimental, theoretical and computational aspects to the program.



(i) The rotation of a plane of polarization of linearly polarized light during its passage through a sample of chiral molecules forms the basis a long-used chemical analytical probe. The applicant is attempting experimentally identify a new effect, multiphoton optical rotatory dispersion, i.e. an intensity-dependent rotation of the plane of polarization. Its study will provide information on the structure, particularly in excited electronic states, of the sample molecules and on the details of the interaction between intense radiation and matter. An effect has been seen in water solutions of pyrimidine nucleosides, building blocks of the DNA and RNA molecules. This effect is related to the production of photohydrates of these molecules during the light-matter interaction. This technique will have important applications in the pharmaceutical industry.



(ii) Moyal quantum mechanics (MQM) is a novel approach to semiclassical approximations in which functions in classical phase space are used to represent quantum operators and their evolution. The applicant and his collaborators have successfully applied it the realistic problems of atomic scattering and collision-broadening of spectral lines. Careful assessment of the quantum effects should lead to new insights into the meaning of quantum theory at the classical-quantum interface. The infrared line shapes for the HD-rate gas atom systems reveal an interference between allowed and collision-induced transitions. Its description is an ideal application for MQM, providing a test of the theory.

"The proposed research bridges research in text structure and computational linguistics, with the goal of finding computational methods for text representation. I will investigate discourse parsing methods for different applications, such as summarization and sentiment detection. Discourse parsing is the classification of units in a text into a complete structure, usually a tree, with nodes labelled with the relation holding among the units. Texts have internal structure and are built hierarchically, through building blocks of different importance to the overall communicative intention behind the text. For example, a paragraph may consist of a claim and evidence supporting that claim. The claim is the most important part, and the evidence is secondary. 



I plan to develop computational methods for extracting this high-level structure in texts. These methods would be useful in applications such as sentiment detection and summarization. Sentiment is defined as subjective content, expressed in whether a text contains positive or negative views and opinions towards its subject matter (e.g., an opinion piece in a newspaper, a movie review, a report on a new product, an e-mail message, or a post on a bulletin board). In sentiment detection, extracting text structure would help us determine which are the most important parts of the text, so that we can extract sentiment from those only.



This research will contribute to understanding and extracting information from text structure. One of the applications, sentiment detection and classification, constitutes a new method of searching and extracting information from large bodies of data (e.g., the Internet). It has applications in business intelligence, e-business, and detection of flames and spam. For instance, sentiment detection has been used to determine the sentiment of investors on public companies, based on postings to bulletin boards or chat rooms.

"Shelf space is a limited resource in retail outlets, that's why it's optimal allocation is one of the most important decisions that take place in the distribution network (i.e. the marketing channel). Previous literature on shelf space allocation developed mathematical allocation models designed to help the decision maker to allocate optimally it's shelf. Those models fail to capture some essential features of the problem. Indeed, by considering that the shelf space allocation problem is a matter of a unique decision maker (i.e. the retailer), these models ignore the interactions existing between this decision maker and the other members of the distribution network to which he belongs. As a consequence, the developed models lack of realism, since in the marketplace members of the distribution network make decisions on pricing, promotions, or advertising investments, that affect the shelf space allocation rules of retailers. The lack of realism is also due to the fact that these models consider the issue of shelf space allocation as a static problem, neglect the impact of important variables on the issue, or do not capture fully the different kinds of behaviours in the channel. In this research proposal, I wish to study the issue of shelf space allocation from a channel's perspective. This will allow me to capture the interactions existing between the different members. I would like also to extend the existing literature by building dynamic models that capture the fact that decisions are taken in real time, but also, the fact that some of them have carry-over effects. Another extension of the literature in the study of fully competitive distribution networks and the consideration of scenarios where channel members could cooperate or not, benefit or not from being channel leaders,..etc. Finally, I would like to investigate situations where demand is uncertain, and provide empirical validation for my models. In order to deal with all these issue, I will use static and dynamic game theory as a methodological approach. This paradigm has the advantage of dealing with situations where the decisions makers' controls and outcomes are interdependent. For situations where analytical solutions are not possible, I will look for numerical solutions.

"The objectives of this proposal are to study complex near-wall turbulent flows and flow of non-Newtonian fluid through porous media. The turbulence research will focus on the investigation of roughness effects on turbulent wall jets, pressure gradient boundary layers, and shallow wakes in an open channel. The values of the pressure gradient parameter will be varied from mild to strong. A planar and stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) will be used to conduct the velocity measurements. The instantaneous velocity field will be used to identify coherent structures, and the dynamic role of these structures on turbulence production in the various turbulent flows and surface conditions will be elucidated. From the PIV data, iso-contours and profiles of the time averaged mean velocity and the various terms in the transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stresses will be evaluated. A planar laser induced fluorescence will be used to study roughness effects on scalar transport and mixing process in the wall jets and wakes. The wall jet results will provide insight into the interaction between the inner and outer layers, and how this interaction is modified by specific roughness. The pressure gradient experiments will provide information on the combined effects of roughness and pressure gradients on the turbulent structure. The physical understanding obtained from the turbulence research and the high quality data sets will be used in the future to guide the development of accurate models for predicting turbulent flows of engineering importance. The porous media will comprise arrays of acrylic rods placed perpendicular and parallel to flow in a rectangular channel. The rods will fill only a fraction of the space between the top and bottom walls of the channel. A variety of non-Newtonian fluids will be studied. The rheological properties of the fluids will be measured. A PIV will be used to study the velocity field. The effects of variables such as porosity, filling fraction of channel height and specific fluid on onset of recirculation within the rods, and penetration of the plain flow into the porous media will be studied. The research will provide opportunity to train highly qualified personnel and provide substantial economic benefits to Canada.

"The human means of communication have a significant characteristic: it is possible to make cooperate (i.e. to use simultaneously and in a complementary way), several modes of communication both in perception and in production. The use of this possibility should bring more speed, effectiveness and comfort to the user-machine interaction, especially for the people suffering from a specific handicap or sensory deficiency. Therefore, the 

use of multimodal applications would be an appropriate and powerful solution.

By multimodal we mean systems combining natural input modes, such as speech, touch, gestures, etc. A comprehensive command or a meta-message is generated and sent to multimedia output devices.

In a pervasive multimodal computing system (PMCS), the system is expected to provide an infrastructure that allows the user to continue working on a computing task whenever and wherever he wants, using the appropriate modality and media devices. The system is expected to adapt seamlessly to the evolution of user's interaction context, the variations and constraints in computing resources, and the possible failures of system components and/or connectors.

In the other hand, autonomic computing (AC) is the perceived solution in solving complexity in large computing systems. 

In the proposed research project we intend to (1) propose a new model for measuring quality of context (QoC) in a PMCS, (2) model the dynamism in a PMCS and its architectural software representation, (3) design a fault-tolerant system that satisfies the functional and quality attribute requirements, and 4) a service ontology for context modeling and a context-aware service adaptation.

It is our goal that over a long period of research, we would have developed mechanisms and principles leading to the application of AC in pervasive multimodality.","Design of a pervasive self-managing computing system","Information systems and technology",CANADA,CANADA,"Multimedia systems and networks"

"A sustainable energy pathway involving hydrogen and other renewable electrochemical fuels is one of the few comprehensive long-term solutions to the improvement of energy efficiency and energy sustainability. The objective of this proposal is to make a significant contribution to creating an efficient process for all scales, including industrial-scale, photocatalytic hydrogen production.  This objective will be met through the development of new photocatalysts, and the design of novel multi-compartment fluidized-bed reactors that allow for improved efficiency.



The general research approach taken here is to investigate fluidized-bed photocatalytic reactors for hydrogen production, and the separate evolution of hydrogen and oxygen. Novel unsupported titanium dioxide (TiO2)-based photocatalysts particles will be formed by a new composite sol-gel method. Multi-compartment fluidized-bed photocatalytic reactors will be designed and operated under new conditions. The performance of the systems will be measured by determining hydrogen evolution rates under various photocatalyst modifications, and a given set of fluidizing conditions using a gas chromatograph (GC).





The expected results of this study include the in-depth understanding of photocatalytic fluidized-bed reactors as an alternative for hydrogen production.  This is expected to ultimately lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable ways to produce hydrogen. In the end, the research supported through the proposed equipment will contribute to new ways of hydrogen generation as an alternative fuel.","Gas chromatograph for studying photo-catalytic hydrogen production","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)",CANADA,CANADA,"Reaction fundamentals and reactor design"
"The presence of toxic organic compounds in water supplies is of great environmental concern in Canada and around the world.  The majority of these contaminants can be destroyed completely by photo-initiated oxidation (activation of strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide by ultraviolet -UV- radiation to form oxidative hydroxyl radicals) or photocatalytic oxidation (formation of hydroxyl radicals through photocatalytic reactions). Despite considerable research and commercial interests in UV photo-initiated and photocatalytic oxidation processes in the past few years, little is known about the process simulation and optimization of these technologies.  As a result, their industrial application to water treatment has been limited and commercial systems, in general, have met with only partial success.  



The overall objective of the research is to investigate the fundamentals of photo-initiated and photocatalytic oxidation processes and to develop and validate models that simulate UV reactor performance, in order to make these technologies efficient, reliable, and cost effective.   The general approach consists of a combined strategy of experimentally studying the fundamentals of the processes (including kinetics, hydrodynamics, and radiation distribution in UV reactors) and developing, in parallel, sophisticated models that enable simulation of the processes, taking into account all the relevant phenomena. The final reactor performance models will be validated through novel laser-based visualization techniques which yield concentration profiles of a fluorescing compound representing organic contaminants inside a UV reactor. The expected results of this study include in-depth understanding of the phenomena affecting UV reactor performance and the development of mathematical models that simulate reactor performance for virtual prototyping and design optimization.  This will ultimately lead to more efficient ways of reducing the level of harmful contaminants in the environment.","UV advanced oxidation reactors for water treatment",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical engineering"

"As software systems become more interconnected and diverse, architects are less able to anticipate and design interactions among components, leaving such issues to be dealt with at runtime. The objective of this research project is to investigate, design, and develop a novel model-based framework to enable self-adaptive software. The proposed methodology can be divided into three crucial phases: i) developing methodologies and tools to define and describe a rich syntax and semantic common context to allow definition of rules for reflective component models and dynamic composition and interactions between them, ii) designing a feature that accommodates an extensible set of reconfiguration algorithms, and ii) devising a systematic reconfiguration engine that monitors a system and decides whether a change is necessary.



We anticipate that such a framework will allow self-adaptive software to be developed with a clean separation of concerns. We also believe that the proposed model-based mechanism will carry out changes which consist of reconfiguration algorithms and change constraint components which can be considered independently from both the application and the adaptation process that drives change. Finally, we anticipate that the adaptive change engine will lead to decisions as to what change is necessary, and what mechanism should be used to carry out that change. 



This research leverages the value of existing software systems, and provides engineering approaches to increase the return of investment for corporations by prolonging the lifetime of their software systems. The proposed research will be validated through experiments with industrial and open source software. We believe the developed techniques will help industrial organizations to effectively keep their adaptive systems up-to-date during their evolution and maintenance.

"The main objective of our research is to understand what causes superconductivity in some materials to persist up to high temperature, halfway between absolute zero and room temperature. Superconductivity is a remarkable property of materials whereby they can conduct electricity without any loss of energy. This property is used to produce the strong magnetic fields needed in the MRI machines in our hospitals, for example. However, applications of superconductivity are severely limited at present by the fact that the materials still have to be cooled.



The significance of understanding the microscopic origin of high-temperature superconductivity is that it would guide scientists in their quest to further enhance the maximum temperature at which a material can be superconducting. Achieving superconductivity at room temperature would undoubtedly spark a major technological revolution.



Our approach is to investigate three different types of superconducting materials and use information extracted from a variety of measurements - typically at very low temperatures and in strong magnetic fields - to determine the conditions that favour superconductivity. A central question is the role of magnetism, which is believed to both cause and compete with superconductivity, especially near the quantum critical point where magnetic order emerges. Our comparative study will shed new light on this fundamental interplay. A recent breakthrough in our research has opened up a highly promising avenue to finally solve what is considered ""one of the great mysteries in physics"".

"Meteorites are crucial to our understanding of the formation of the Solar System because most formed about 4.5 billion years ago, right around when our Solar System was created. 



The largest group of meteorites is called ordinary chondrites. A subset of these are called L6 meteorites and are designated ""highly shocked"", meaning that the parent body on which they originated was hit by tremendous pressure, causing the minerals in these meteorites to develop features such as shock veins. Of further interest is that this tremendous pressure is very likely similar to that deep inside our Earth, so one can study the minerals within the L6 meteorites to learn more about what is happening in our Earth's interior.



Meteorite samples are also very important because they are used to design many of the instruments used on space missions, such as the Mars rovers. The Hayabusa spacecraft will return to Earth in 2010 after having acquired samples from asteroid 25143 Itokawa and in 2016, the Dawn mission will return, after orbiting 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta. There is an increased interest in asteroid materials by both NASA and space agencies worldwide; understanding the minerals in meteorites is key to both the development of missions and the interpretation of spectral imaging collected.



The objective of this study is to perform a systematic, comprehensive mineralogical study of highly shocked ordinary chondrites, the major group of meteorites, specifically the shock veins in over 50 L6 meteorites, to further our understanding of the origins of the Solar System. Specifically, the twin goals are to investigate the mineralogical make-up of these L6 meteorites in order to help understand the parent body on which they originated; and to potentially shed light in our understanding of the formation of the early Solar System.

"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the focus of intense research activity due to a myriad of potential applications in, for example, health and environmental monitoring, security, smart agriculture, disaster relief, and military information gathering, with economic and social impacts that are anticipated to be profound. Many opportunities and challenges exist for intelligent application designs which exploit the distributed computing potential of such networks. The challenges are mainly due to the fact that WSN nodes typically run on non-replenishable batteries, making energy efficiency of paramount importance.

     The proposed research will focus on three aspects of energy efficiency in WSNs. The first is the design of optimal node placement schemes to efficiently achieve given tasks. Specifically, in addition to satisfying coverage and connectivity requirements of an application and the network, our proposed node placement solutions will be optimized for the communication requirements imposed by application dependent distributed computing algorithms in order to increase the maximum usable lifetime of the network. The second aspect is the design of distributed statistical procedures appropriate for WSNs. Our procedures will be designed for energy efficiency while maintaining a given precision of inference, and will provide specific requirements for our node placement strategies to ensure balanced energy consumption across the network. The third aspect is the design of energy efficient adaptive modulation schemes to enable nodes to transmit information reliably under changing source and channel conditions using as little energy as possible.

     The research will directly benefit startups and large companies alike who wish to position themselves in the burgeoning WSN services market by offering customized turnkey application solutions, as well as benefitting government sponsored WSN projects aimed at improving the health and security of Canadians. The support for this research will mainly go towards the training of highly qualified personnel, funding two Ph.D. students, one postdoctoral fellow, and three Master's students per year.","Deployment, distributed inferance, and modulation problems for energy efficient wireless sensor networks","Information and communication services",CANADA,CANADA,"Information systems design"

"The proposed research ""3D Shape Recovery from Images Viewed by Multiple Cameras"" will attempt to estimate the 3 dimensional coordinates of all pixels in a 2 dimensional image with the help of additional images viewed from multiple cameras.   3D modeling of objects and scenes contained in multiple 2D views is the conceptual objective.  This research goes beyond still images and works on video images viewed by a multi-camera assembly of 4 (or 5) video cameras interfaced to a personal computer.  The real time multi-camera vision system continuously produces and displays a dense stereo disparity map that shows the distance to every point of the observed scene by the multiple cameras.  The system is also capable of displaying a virtual reality image viewed from an arbitrary viewpoint separate from the positions of real cameras.  Established mathematical theories of multiple view geometry are extensively applied to the epipolar (cross-eye stereo) configuration as well as to the parallel view axis configuration.  Potential applications include (1) robotic applications, such that the multi-camera vision system continuously provides distance information to a self-navigating robot for collision avoidance, (2) video surveillance capable of detecting 3D motions to indicate whether a video object is moving closer to or away from the cameras, and (3) synthesis of 3D stereo views for projection on stereoscopic 3D LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) equipped with the parallax barrier,  which will set a new standard for stereoscopic video, video games and TV.

"This proposal aims to fund academic access to the St John's Centrifuge Centre, one of the world's premier geotechnical centrifuge modelling facilities, to train highly qualified personnel and to enable seminal research on significant Canadian infrastructure problems; in particular, protecting Canadians against earthquake risk, confronting the issues surrounding climate change on buried infrastructure, addressing cold-regions issues such as frost heave on lifelines, and protecting the environment from groundwater contamination.



Last year, the recommended design accelerations for seismic loading were increased by a factor of about 2 in Greater Vancouver as well as many other areas of Canada (e.g. Byrne et al., 2006). In other words, Canadian infrastructure in these regions must be designed to have much higher earthquake resistance and consider much more complicated seismic loading scenarios. In the past few years, it has also been realised that global warming will lead to significantly changed environmental conditions for Canadian infrastructure, both in the Far North as well as the more populated regions of Southern Canada. Not only is our knowledge of the science of these phenomena lacking, but there is a severe shortage of engineers with expertise in earthquake engineering or cold-regions engineering. This proposal is a timely response to the enormous demand by Canada's engineering industry for scientific advances and highly qualified personnel in these fields. 



This proposal represents the combined efforts of a team of 19 leading Canadian academics to use this facility to address these specific Canadian geotechnical engineering problems and to train 40 graduate student researchers. This proposal will directly benefit Canada through safer, more effective infrastructure designs, as well as strengthen this area of the Canadian knowledge economy when the majority of these experts join Canadian consulting companies upon graduation.

"Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacteria which, in its antibiotic resistant form (MRSA), has become a common and dangerous hospital infection. It also causes mastitis in dairy cattle which is responsible for serious losses to the dairy industry. Unfortunately, most vaccines described up until now are only partially protective and are specific to certain types of infection. This  research program which has been underway for several years was designed to study how S. aureus causes changes in the protective responses (immune responses) of  infected animals and how these responses alter the efficiency of  vaccines.  A combination of vaccines made from genetic material (DNA) and  proteins of the bacterium has been injected into mice which were  then infected with the bacteria. Such DNA/protein vaccines are a relatively new technology that has recently been licensed for some fish viruses and West Nile virus in horses. Our results have suggested that  each manifestation of S. aureus infection, be it arthritis, septicemia, endocarditis or mastitis, stimulates a slightly different immune response by the animal. Vaccination against the infection in one part of the body does not necessarily protect against infections at other sites. Thus it is important to identify how the immune responses differ from infection to infection. The immediate objective of this program is to study  how the immune responses to S. aureus in mouse models vary during infections at different sites. The longer-term objectives of this program will be to find out how the immune response changes after the animals have been injected with different prototype vaccines. We will continue to use mouse models of S. aureus-induced septicemia, arthritis and mastitis, but we will also use a simulation of the bacterial colonization of the nose. This is often where the bacteria appears to be present in humans but without causing any symptoms.  This ""nasal carriage"" may explain how antibiotic resistant bacteria have spread so fast. The success of such a project will have an important impact in the fight against other emerging and potentially dangerous bacteria.

"ROLE OF HUMAN CORONAVIRUS PROTEINS IN THE REGULATION OF HOST CELL - VIRUS INTERACTIONS. 

Viral infections affect billions of living organisms each year, with millions of annual deaths and dramatic economic losses in both the veterinary and medical fields. Thus, the development of preventive and curative anti-viral strategies is of utmost importance. For that purpose, it remains essential to acquire a detailed understanding, at the molecular, cellular, tissue and organism levels, of all facets of virus-host interactions leading to acute or persistent infection with the underlying development of virus-induced disease, or viral pathogenesis.

Coronaviruses are ubiquitous pathogens responsible for a variety of economically devastating diseases of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as the central nervous system of various animal species, such as cattle, pigs and fowl. Known since the mid 1960's, strains OC43 and 229E of human coronaviruses are recognized respiratory pathogens causing up to a third of common colds, and suspected to be involved in gastrointestinal and neurological diseases, the latter being the target of my research team for the last several years.  

The capacity of a virus such as the coronavirus to effectively replicate within a permissive cell and the capacity of this cell to respond to the infection remains poorly understood. Therefore, the proposed research program will provide in-depth characterization of the functions of proteins of human coronaviruses and on their interactions with cellular proteins in susceptible cells and in a mouse animal model of viral pathogenesis. This important information will contribute to our global understanding of the mechanisms of host-cell virus interactions and help decipher cellular pathways leading to the development of a viral disease.

"Increasing regulatory, public, and eco-efficiency pressures are forcing industries to maximize the amount of materials that can be recovered and recycled from their products. One current example is the EU directive requiring 95% of all discarded automobiles to meet specific recyclable content criteria through to the year 2015. Such regulatory pressures, due to the global market of the automotive industry, also affect Canadian produced automobiles. Presently, about 75% of an automobile is recycled but the bulk of this are metals. Plastics, however, have proven problematic to isolate from one another and to recover efficiently on a mass scale from complex consumer products such as automobiles. To date, only a few commercial operations claim to successfully separate plastics from other plastics, and there can be significant impacts from the process itself. In the case of vehicle recovery, the challenge is to attain the additional 20% of recyclability through cost-effective, yet environmentally acceptable means: much of this 20% are plastics from discarded cars, disposed of as shredder residue (SR). This wastes re-usable materials and decreases landfill space. Furthermore, end-of-life recovery processes do not usually pretreat items to improve the efficiency of materials recovery and instead depend on extensive post-processing after shredding to isolate desired materials. 



This research proposal will examine if pretreatments, such as cryogenic applications, can enhance the dismantling or liberation of materials from shredding and improve sorting, and will use automotive plastics as an example of materials to be recovered. This research will also increase the overall knowledge about end-of-life recovery processes and their benefits and impacts, which have been largely assumed in life cycle assessments: what is recyclable may ultimately not be recovered because of multiple factors. Finally, enhancing materials liberation complements a newly proposed means of assessing product complexity and its potential for materials recovery.

"The use of nanocapsules and nanoparticles in the delivery of active compounds (AIs) in agriculture and biomedical applications has been actively pursued. However, the quantification of the release of AIs has been problematic due to the size of these nanoparticles. In order to measure the concentration of AI released from the nanoparticles, the AI loaded nanoparticles have to be separated from the bulk solution. Two common techniques are used, namely centrifugation and filtration, but they present numerous problems, such as forced release of AI, adsorption on filters, and blockage of pores. Thus, an alternative method that is more reliable and accurate needs to be developed to facilitate such measurements. Recently, Tam and co-workers have demonstrated that the Electromotive Force (EMF) measurements can be readily used to perform such measurements. They have demonstrated that the proposed method is accurate and simple to implement. The

key to this methodology is the design of the AI selective membrane that will be incorporated in an electrode for EMF measurements. Thus, the project will involve the design and application of the EMF method to quantify the concentration of AI released from nanocapsule formulations developed by Vive Nano Inc. The successful implementation of this approach will simplify the development cycles and time of the nanocapsule polymers by Vive Nano. If the approach is successfully demonstrated and adopted by Vive Nano, it will have significant economic spinoffs for the company and Canada as a whole.","Controlled release of active compounds from nanocapsule polymers","Agricultural chemicals (fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides)",CANADA,CANADA,"Polymers and coatings"
"The proposed research program involves the synthesis of new materials and comprised of two major themes, namely the development of; (1) polymeric nanostructures for drug/gene delivery, and (2) responsive functional nanoparticles for drug delivery, protein and water purification processes. The program seeks to address fundamental issues that will enhance the pharmaceutical, biotech, and environmental industries in Canada. 

The first theme involves the synthesis and development of novel block copolymers that self-assemble in the presence of drugs or DNA. The binding interactions between the drug or DNA and block copolymers, and their delivery to targeted sites will be elucidated. The novelty of this proposal lies in our attempt to create new materials, study their characteristics in the presence of drugs/DNA, and improving their delivery to targeted sites. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of the interactions between the delivery systems and their payload. This will lead to the development of better delivery systems that can be economically exploited for the treatment of diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and genetic disorders, which will be beneficial to patients and the Canadian Health Care system.

The second theme involves the development of responsive functional nanoparticles for drug delivery, and for the recovery of protein/enzyme and toxic molecules. This project focuses on the development of functional microgels, which can also be used as colloidal scaffolds to prepare functional magnetic nano-particles (MNP). The MNP can be used for the purification of proteins/enzymes and removal of organic molecules  in contaminated water systems. Binding of proteins/enzymes or organic contaminants to MNP can be achieved by incorporating receptors or ligands on the surface of MNP. The material aspects of nanoparticle synthesis, characterisation, and the process integration in a biotech process is novel. The proposed approach will change the way proteins/enzymes are currently purified or organic contaminants removed. Such technology will reduce the cost of producing proteomic drugs/enzymes, and safeguard Canada's water supply systems.","Novel nanostructured systems for biomedical and chemical applications","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical engineering"
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) attacks the brain and spinal cord, which can lead to severe disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for observing MS damage in vivo, and is therefore used in the majority of clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of new MS therapies. To understand the complex pathology of MS, the disease-induced changes in both the brain and the spinal cord must be studied and precisely measured where possible. However, while accurate image analysis algorithms for measuring structural changes in the brain are commonly used in MS studies, and the morphometry of specific brain structures remains a very active area of research, the development of algorithms for spinal cord analysis seems to be lagging. The main objective of the proposed project is to improve the sensitivity and reproducibility of spinal cord morphometry on MRI for studying MS. We will design and implement new software methods to address a number of technical issues that we have identified. Pilot data will be collected on healthy volunteers for initial development of the new algorithms, with subsequent validation performed on real clinical data from the MS/MRI Research Group, an interdisciplinary group at the University of British Columbia with extensive experience in the application of neuroimaging biomarkers in MS clinical trials. The primary mandate of the MS/MRI Research Group is to develop better trial methodologies to improve the lives of patients with neurological diseases. MS costs the Canadian economy over $1 billion dollars per year in prescription medications, medical services, and lost earnings. We believe that increasing the sensitivity of spinal cord MRI biomarkers would have a strong impact on the cost-effectiveness of developing new MS drugs, which would directly benefit the pharmaceutical industry and Canadian health care system. By making the drug development process more efficient, better drugs can get to market faster, and the burden of MS on Canadian patients and the economy can be reduced.

"The modern financial industry-comprising the banking, investment and insurance sectors - relies heavily on modern, computer-based risk analysis and management. As the array of financial products grows in variety and complexity, accurate and reliable risk management has become both more complex and more essential. Several tragic failures in recent years-such as the rapid demise of Enron, Barings Bank, Long Term Capital, Equitable Life in UK, and more recently the subprime crisis - have caused millions of investors to lose their money, and have provided ample evidence of the consequences of inappropriate risk management. Reliable risk mitigating and risk managing of the enterprise become a critical issue for the viability of a financial institution. It is this important area where Prof. Tan will have a significant contribution. Prof. Tan's research will focus on three key areas. The first objective of Prof. Tan's research program is devoted to developing robust and theoretical sound model for optimally using reinsurance to manage the risks of an insurance company. The second objective of Prof. Tan's research program is to analyze and assess the riskiness of an insurance business by analyzing the evolution of the surplus and its interplay between the premium, claims and interest. By incorporating many empirically observed characteristics of the claim experience, such as correlation and the possibility of large claims, the interest factor and delayed factor, Prof. Tan derives some theoretical results on the likelihood that an insurance business's surplus will ever fall below zero. This provides important information on the viability of insurance business and calls for appropriate risk mitigation measures if this probability is large. While the first two objectives focus mostly on the theoretical analysis, Prof. Tan also recognizes that many of the problems encountered in practice are often not tractable. Hence the last objective of Prof. Tan's research program focuses on the state-of-the-art numerical solution for complex models. The enhanced simulation technique has the potential of translating into a significant savings, both in time and in computing effort. This greatly complements the analytical results established in the first two objectives.

"A cost-effective technology will be developed for simultaneous absorption of NOx and SO2  for flue gases using novel catalysts. Hexamminecobalt (II) and iodide ions are the co-catalysts which can be regenerated with UV irradiation. Most importantly, SO2 will actually be beneficial to the removal of NOx in this novel solvent and the corresponding efficiencies of NOx and SO2 could be much higher than those reported in literature. The emission control efficiency is expected to be further enhanced by high contact areas between the gases and liquid phases using a properly designed spray tower. Such a catalyst system may be introduced to existing ammonia-based scrubbers (such as ammonia solution) without major modifications needed. The products of ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate can be used as a feedstock for fertilizer industry.

"    )	In a blink of an eye, an expert birdwatcher can discriminate a ""white crown sparrow"" from a ""Lincoln sparrow.""  Likewise, the expert botanist can discern the subtle details between a ""Russula"" mushroom and a ""Latarius"" mushroom. What are the factors that contribute to the development of this kind of perceptual expertise?  Undoubtedly, experts have more experience to objects in their domain of expertise  than novices. However, it is not clear whether it is the amount of experience or the kind of experience that shapes expert performance.  In this study, we will train subjects to recognize objects and faces at either a general level or a specific level of categorization.   In our experiments, subjects will receive  the same amount of training exposure to the object and face stimuli. The prediction is that for objects and faces that are categorized at a more detailed level, subjects will show expert-like perceptual abilities and this skill will transfer to the recognition of new stimuli from related categories.  However, for objects that are categorized at a general level, subjects will show very little expert abilities and little or no transfer to new categories.  Thus, it is the kind of category experience, not just the amount that determines expertise. This prediction will be tested using electrophysiological methods in which we will measure brain activity at the scalp while subjects are trained to become expert recognizers.  We will also monitor eye movements to evaluate changes in perceptual strategies due to the demands of training.  The goal of these experiments is to understand the changes that occur in cognitive and neurophysiological processes as one develops from a perceptual novice to a perceptual expert.

"Cells in multicellular organisms are arranged in a remarkably diverse array of structures. My main scientific interest is in determining how cells come together to form complex structures and then, once formed, how such structures are maintained. I am interested in the basic cellular mechanisms that determine how cells interact with each other and with their environment. In particular I am interested in how cell adhesion is utilized during animal development. I use one type of adhesion, cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, as a model to address fundamental question about the role of adhesion in development. Adhesion receptors of the integrin family are the core components of an adhesion complex that is important for the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix. The disassembly and assembly of integrin adhesions is carefully regulated but it is currently not known in what ways the precise regulation of the turnover of integrin contributes to animal development. I have shown that it is possible to visualize the assembly and dynamics of integrin adhesion complexes using live imaging of tagged integrin associated proteins in embryonic muscles. I have shown that the dynamics of integrin adhesion vary during development. Many of the proteins associated with integrin adhesion are GFP-tagged and modifications in integrin-associated proteins that alter the dynamics of integrin adhesions in cell culture are now available in flies. I will carry out a systematic survey of turnover of integrin adhesion dynamics within the fly.","Analysis of dynamics and protein turnover in integrin-mediated adhesion in drosphilia muscles.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Extra-cellular matrix"

"Experimental design is an area of study in statistics that deal with efficient methods for collecting data for scientific and technological investigations. Factorial designs are a broad class of experimental plans for studying the relationship between a response variable and several explanatory variables. The proposed research centers on the study of two classes of designs: orthogonal arrays for physical experiments and space-filling designs for computer experiments. All these designs can be regarded as factorial designs. The usefulness of factorial designs is well documented in the literature. One major field where they have found and are continuing to find huge success is the manufacturing industries. Improving the quality of the exsiting products or designing new products all require the use of factorial designs. Today, we are seeing more and more fields in which factorial designs are successfully used. Examples are management, marketing, financial services, drug discovery, and computer software testing, to mention a few. In addition to being directly useful as discussed above, factorial designs form a basis on which other useful designs, such as those in response surface methodology, can be built. At an even more theoretical level, the study of factorial designs is very important because of their intimate relationship with combinatorics and graph theory.



The objectives of this research are to develop new theory and methods for orthogonal arrays and space-filling designs, extend the existing methods, and promote the application of such tools. Training students is an important aspect of the proposed research. The proposed research sheds new light on the study of factorial designs, leads to new economical designs for the experiments in the physical, chemical, and engineering sciences, and most importantly, promotes the application of factorial designs in the areas such as biotechnology and medical research that have huge potential to benefit further from design methodology.

"Photoacoustic imaging is an emerging field that utilizes laser pulses to excite ultrasound waves in tissue and uses ultrasound detectors to record the ultrasound waves and reconstruct an image. When tissue absorbs a laser pulse, its local temperature is slightly yet rapidly increased by laser heating. The rapid temperature rising induces acoustic wave through thermal expansion. The advantage of photoacoustic imaging is biochemical specificity and deep penetration.



Photoacoustic imaging measures optical absorption which is complementary to the ultrasound measurement of mechanical properties of tissues. Optical absorption has been shown to be able to identify different bio-molecules in tissues. Blood vessels can be imaged because blood has higher absorption than surrounding tissues. Tumors can potentially be detected because they have higher blood flow than normal tissues. 



A tunable, high-energy, pulsed laser source is requested in this grant. There are a series of research projects that will be based on the new laser system. A photoacoustic imaging system will be developed using the laser as a light source. Signal processing algorithms derived from ultrasound imaging will be applied to the photoacoustic imaging. Nanoparticles will be studied as contrast agent for the photoacoustic imaging. Therefore, this laser will enable investigators at UBC to start a new research direction in the emerging photoacoustic imaging field.  



The primary application will be in the area of prostate cancer, where photoacoustic imaging will be combined with current ultrasound imaging to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of cancer detection.

"Cancer ranks second among all causes of death in North America. If detected in the pre-invasive stage, its survival rate can be significantly increased. Optical imaging provides a noninvasive way to visualize and detect precancerous and cancerous lesions. Multiphoton Microscopy (MPM) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) are two cutting-edge imaging techniques. MPM detects cells and extracellular matrix with sub-micron resolution and molecular specificity. OCT provides cross-sectional tomographic images showing anatomic structures of tissues on a millimeter scale. We propose to develop a multi-modality optical imaging system, integrating MPM and OCT on a single platform. The sensitivity of MPM to cells and extracellular matrix, and that of OCT to interfaces can enable new observations of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during the development of neovasculature, cell migration, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These events are fundamentally important to nearly all biological processes, from cancer to wound healing, aging, and diabetes. With benefits from both sides, MPM/OCT will provide a new imaging tool that has both sensitivity and specificity to detect precancerous and cancerous lesions.  



Our technical objectives are to: Build a multi-modality MPM/OCT system and optimize its imaging speed and penetration depth; Develop scaling capability of the MPM/OCT system; Design an endoscopic MPM/OCT system for in vivo study. The applications will include: Apply the MPM/OCT microscope to image tissue specimens for characterizing differences between normal, precancerous, and cancerous tissues; Perform in vivo imaging of lung cancer with the MPM/OCT endoscope to study the process of lung carcinogenesis. Applications will be carried out in collaboration with the BC Cancer Agency. The use of the proposed MPM/OCT optical imaging to study carcinogenesis and to detect lung cancer in its pre-invasive stage has the potential to create a substantial impact in the management of this highly fatal disease.

"Carbon nanotube (CNT) is a novel material with unique mechanical, thermal, optical and electronic properties. The proposed work is motivated by the emerging interest in the integration of CNTs and biological structures in nanotechnology and biomedical applications. For example, it has be discovered recently that single-stranded DNA can form a hybrid with CNT by wrapping around it in a helical fashion, and provide efficient separation of as-produced CNT bundles. Selective cancer cell destruction has been achieved using functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), without harming normal cells. SWCNTs have also been shown to have the ability of detecting conformational transitions of DNA. Development of these technologies depends critically on the nature of the CNT and the bio-structure forming the hybrid and the properties of the hybrid material. To understand and predict the properties requires us to develop models for the interactions between CNT and bio-structures. In this work, we focus our effort on understanding the major interactions between CNT and DNA, and combining them into one framework by developing models with a few materials properties that can encapsulate much of the molecular details, and are of a form that allows analysis of many phenomena at the meso-scale. The interactions to be studied in this work are also common in many other nano-bio systems. Therefore the results from this work will be beneficial to a class of biological molecule/inorganic system interaction problems related to the engineering of nano-biomolecular material in electronic industry, nanotechnology and biomedical applications.

"Biosensors are powerful tools providing selective identification of pathogens (e.g., bacteria, virus) and toxic chemicals in industrial products, environmental samples (e.g., air, soil, water), and clinical specimens.  Novel biosensors with higher sensitivity, better specificity, and larger-scale multiplicity will play an important role in advancing analysis technologies for environmental monitoring, early cancer diagnostics, and basic research towards improved understanding of untreatable diseases.  The proposed project will aim at developing a new generation of biosensors, and potential biochips, based on single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) field effect transistors (FETs).  In a SWNT-FET, each conduction channel, a SWNT, is about 2nm in diameter, which is size compatible with a single biomolecule.  The electrical conductance of a SWNT-FET device is extremely sensitive to its surrounding chemical and electrostatic environment.  It allows direct electrical detection of biological events, such as DNA hybridization and antigen-antibody binding, on the sensor surface.  Potential applications include: 1) fully electronic DNA or protein microarrays for molecular diagnosis, which eliminates the need for labor intensive and costy fluorescence labeling;  2) environmental sensors that can rapidly and accurately identify highly pathogenic particles on-the-spot in public places.","Development of carbon nanotube biosensors and investigation of sensing mechanism","Physical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Physical chemistry"

"Rock slope hazards are particularly troublesome the mountainous terrain of western Canada. A major challenge in the stability assessment of steep rock slopes is prediction of likely failure modes through discontinuous or jointed rock. Stability assessment must be based on well-constructed geological models. The overall research objective is to produce methods for reliably estimating the stability or probability of failure of rock slopes, which is required for risk assessment and design of mitigative measures. Rock slope stability assessment must taking into account the variability of geometric and strength properties of existing geological structures. The research will involve implementing technologies and procedures for

constructing representative structural geology models of rock slopes and verifying the accuracy of these models. Progress must be made on integrated data handling and 3D computer visualization techniques in the modeling process. Photogrammetry and laser scanning technologies will be used for safely mapping and surveying steep slopes from a distance to determine detailed slope geometry and the three-dimensional spacing, orientation and continuity data for the structures that intersect the rock slope. The 3D geometric and geological models will be used to construct 3D numerical models.

Enzymes are biological molecules that catalyze essentially all of the chemical reactions that occur in living systems.  Reactions that require thousands of years to complete in the absence of a catalyst can take place in seconds in the presence of an enzyme.  A detailed understanding of how enzymes accelerate these reactions can greatly advance our knowledge of chemical catalysis.  In addition, this understanding allows the chemist to design molecules that interfere with, or inhibit, the action of enzymes.  This is particularly useful when an invading bacteria or virus depends on the enzyme for survival.  In these cases the enzyme inhibitors have the potential to serve as drugs.



UV spectroscopy is an extremely important tool in studying the rate (or speed) of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  When products of an enzymatic reaction absorb different wavelengths of light than the starting materials, the extent of reaction can be directly monitored by changes in the UV spectrum of a given sample.  This application is for the funding necessary to purchase a UV spectrophotometer.  It acts as the ""eyes"" of the enzymologist and is used to investigate the efficiency of a given enzyme (or mutant enzyme) and the potency of enzyme inhibitors.  This evaluation is key to our basic understanding of how enzymes work and is required in the development of effective inhibitors that may act as pharmaceuticals.

One area of research that we are interested in involves the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of sugars that play key roles in the physiology of humans, plants, and pathogenic organisms.  One such sugar is sialic acid that coats the surface of mammalian cells and mediates cell-cell recognition processes.  For example, the influenza virus binds to the surface sialic acids during its first stages of infectivity.  Another area of research involves studies on plant enzymes that produce complex natural products and help the plant survive.  One such project involves the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of alkaloids such as morphine.  We hope to use this enzyme to efficiently prepare new alkaloids of medicinal value.

"Quantum information is a relatively new field that involves physics and computer science.

It turns out that quantum mechanics can help in solving computational tasks, performing distributed computation and performing new cryptographic protocols. It is also a field where quantum mechanics is studied using the tools, ideas and concepts belonging to computer science. Although the field is young, it has been extremely successful. In this proposal, I wish to address both how computer science can help to understand physics and how quantum mechanics can be used to solve useful computational tasks.  First, I plan to study how the quantum computer can compute functions more efficiently than the classical computer. Computer science is also interested in distributed computation problems where the amount of communication is the main concern. We know that entanglement can some times be used to reduce communication. I plan to study the relationship between entanglement and communication. One of the areas where quantum information was extremely successful is cryptography.

"The past offers a powerful window for understanding future climate change. Evidence from the past, for instance, suggests that ice and melt-water discharge has played a critical role in abrupt climate change. In this general context, the research will target three fundamental objectives. First, to reconstruct and subsequently refine well-constrained deglacial (and eventually full glacial cycle) ice-sheet and melt-water chronologies with well-defined error bars. Second, extending this, to elucidate the role of melt-water fluxes in climate change during the last glacial cycle. Finally, probability distributions for the future evolution of the present-day ice-sheets will be determined and over time refined.



The approach taken involves a sequence of statistically rigorous calibrations of a 3-dimensional glacial and climate system model against large and diverse sets of paleo data (including relative sea-level data, geodetic observations, and pro-glacial lake levels). After construction of an interim calibrated global deglacial ice and melt-water chronology, the dynamical role of melt-water fluxes will be analyzed through coupled ocean-atmospheric-vegetation and glacial system modelling. Running the calibrated fully coupled model into the future will provide probability distributions for the future evolution of the present-day ice-sheets. This will address a major gap in current climate change assessments.



The novelty of this work lies in the application of a comprehensive earth systems modelling approach that is highly data-integrated and probabilistic to major questions concerning polar climate stability and the role of melt-water in abrupt climate change. More generally, the work will be a case study in improving methodologies for rigorously analyzing the dynamics of complex nonlinear physical systems in an observation-grounded manner.

"One major research direction of this proposal is the study of arrangements of simple geometric objects, such as lines, segments, disks, triangles, etc. and find out what makes them simple or complex, when can they avoid certain patterns and answer many similar questions.



A simple example is the study of the complexity of the union of geometric regions. The union of n line segments can partition the plane into a quadratic number of disconnected regions, but the complement of the union of n discs is consist of just a linear number of regions and the boundary can be described in linear time (linear complexity). Long and narrow triangles behave like segments, while ""fat"" triangles behave like circular disks with regard to the complexity of their union. I propose to conduct research in three and higher dimensions where there exist some partial results on the subject but the situation is much less understood than in the planar case.



Another problem I propose to study is the conflict-free coloring problem. Assume a few radio stations (with known reception ranges) are used to broadcast a station and one wants to assign frequencies to these stations. A user can only receive a station if he is within the reception range of that station but outside the range of all other stations that broadcast on the same frequency. What is the minimum number of frequencies that must be used if we want each user within the range of some station to be able to receive some station? What is the worst case number of frequencies needed as a function of the broadcast stations? The answer depends on the geometric shape of the broadcast regions. It is well understood for circular (disk) regions and somewhat well for axis-parallel rectangles, but a lot of further study is needed to tackle the problem for other types of regions.","Complexity issues in geometric and combinatorial arrangements","Mathematical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,Complexity

"Estimation of Quartz Appearance in Mineral Type Granular Materials 



The high quality of modern day life depends strongly on the continuous improvement of the technology surrounding us and preserving our nature. To achieve these objectives, a long-term solution is needed to environmental issues, such as soil water pollution, ecological problems of waste disposal, soil erosion, or impacts of engineering facilities buried in the ground (high-voltage power cables, pipelines, pavements, hydrogen storage systems, or underground radioactive waste disposal). The successful computer design of the above amenities and long-term solutions to environmental issues of the ground require reliable data concerning the thermal and transport properties of soil over a full range of soil wetness, variable soil compactness and temperature. The database of these properties is very limited (a few Canadian soils only) and often incomplete. Measuring soil thermal conductivity is expensive, time consuming, and error prone. Therefore, instead of using direct measurements, the use of predictive models based on soil mineralogical data is recommended. Over the past 50 years, however, the quartz abundance in soils was not measured and it was assumed as a fitting parameter. Therefore, the project is focusing on measurements of soil mineralogical composition and soil thermal conductivity of Canadian soils representing each province and territory. The gathered data will be used for the development of a global predictive model to be applied in computer modeling of heat and moisture flow in the ground. Furthermore, the existing computer package dealing with prediction of soil thermal and hydraulic properties will be enhanced by addition of Canadian soils, thus providing reliable estimates based on easily obtainable data. The development of a portable thermal conductivity probe for field measurements is also a part of this project. Expertise gained will be shared with the geo-science and engineering sector dealing with the environmental aspects or geotechnical utilization of soils.

"1. Men and women use different fuels during endurance exercise with women burning more fat and less carbohydrate and protein as compared with men.  By giving estrogen (the female sex hormone) supplements to men, we found that they had a similar metabolic profile to that seen in women during exercise.  We have started to characterize these estrogen effects at the level of the muscle cell using biochemical and molecular analyses and would like to further characterize these effects using powerful methods of entire genome profiling (gene chips).  We will also use trangenic animals lacking the estrogen receptor to determine what role the cell receptor has in mediating the metabolic effects.  

2. After very strenuous exercise (eccentric) there is muscle damage and inflammation.  In spite of similar damage, women have a lesser inflammatory response, yet we do not know the mechanism behind this observation.  It is possible that estrogen functions as an anti-oxidant directly or through interactions with receptors on the muscle to alter cellular processes that protect the cell from the damaging effects of this type of muscle contraction.  We would like to use our model of estrogen administration to men and the gene chip experiments in men and women to characterize the response in muscle after damaging exercise.  



Overall, we feel that estrogen will make muscles more metabolically efficent during exercise and lessen some of the effects of damaging exercise.

   Hearing is central to our daily lives. We easily differentiate between many simultaneous sounds on the basis of their pitch and location, yet little is known about the perceptual and neural processes that underlie this ability.  The process of sorting out the overlapping sounds in a typical acoustic environment is called Auditory Scene Analysis.  It is fundametally related to our ability to attend to one auditory source and ignore others.  The field of Cognitive Neuroscience is beginning to identify the neural correlates of analagous processes in the visual domain, but has made little progress in audition.  The experiments proposed here will investigate how the auditory system makes use of spatial information to direct attention to one or another sound.  The results should tell us more about how spatial information helps us to hear in complicated environments. Ultimately these results may have important bearing on a variety of situations in which hearing is compromised - such as in Age-Related Hearing Loss, or when auditory attention fails to work properly - such as Attention-Deficit Disorder.

"National and provincial policies within Canada are pushing towards a future which relies on sustainable production and consumption of energy, and the reliability of the power grid plays a critical role in ensuring these policies can succeed.  From an operational standpoint, one of the most significant issues facing the power industry is improving the situational awareness (SA) of grid operators, defined as ""the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future.""  The critical importance of SA was shown most recently in the August 2003 blackout, where a lack of SA was listed as one of the root causes of the blackout that affected an estimated 50 million people with estimated costs in the range of $4 to $10 billion US dollars.  

Unfortunately, the tremendous changes occurring within the North American power grid on both the supply and demand side are likely to increase the uncertainty which power grid operators must contend with on a daily basis.  In the face of these new challenges, enhancing SA will be an important part of preventing additional widespread outages.  The fundamental research objective is to advance SA in power systems by taking advantage of new meter and processor technologies.  This research will help move control centers from CPU-driven processing of traditional measurements to a new, state-of-the-art system which leverages not only improvements in metering technology but also in processing capability.  The most significant long term benefit of this research is a greater awareness of grid conditions on the part of system operators, which will in turn allow them to better anticipate and preempt possible failures on the power grid.  In addition, working prototypes will be developed throughout the research process in order to solicit feedback from interested parties and facilitate the transfer of any technologies that are developed.

"All animals require oxygen to maintain aerobic metabolism and ultimately to survive.  Nonetheless, there are situations, externally or internally generated, where oxygen is limited, called hypoxia.  Animals possess numerous adaptations for coping with these kinds of environmental stresses.  The goal of my research program is to understand how animals control their body temperature and metabolism during times when a high metabolic rate or high body temperature is impossible or inefficient to sustain, such as during hypoxia, hypothermia, hibernation, torpor or sleep.  Currently, where this control resides in the body is unknown.  Cells and tissues seem to have built-in mechanisms for regulating metabolism, but the role of the nervous system as the control centre is less well known.  The widespread prevalence in the animal kingdom of these reduced metabolic states argues for a great need throughout evolution for the development of alternative physiological strategies for coping with severe environmental conditions.  I take a comparative and integrative approach, studying animals that have naturally evolved physiological defences for coping with hypoxia.  I have been developing a research program aimed at studying how animals utilise temperature to alter their metabolic needs, since it is well known that cold slows metabolic processes.  It turns out that all animals prefer lower body temperatures and exhibit lower metabolism when faced with hypoxia.  How this is controlled physiologically and behaviourally, and why all animals exhibit this response, particularly when hypoxia only occurs in certain environments or times of life, is unknown.  Understanding this process will shed light on how animals modify and manipulate metabolic needs, and potentially lead to the development of interventions aimed at altering metabolism and lowering body temperature.  In light of recent, rapid climate changes, a better understanding of the inherent behavioural and physiological means by which animals regulate temperature will also allow us to predict and assess more accurately how and if animals can successfully cope with these changes.

"A promising area of research within the field of therapeutic ultrasound is the application of intensive focused ultrasound (IFUS) to treat neurological disorders in various neural tissues and structures such as brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. There are still a number of scientific and/or technical challenges that must be resolved before IFUS could find an established place in medicine and biology. An important area that still needs significant investigation is the complicated interaction of the IFUS beam with neural tissues and structures and the resulting bioeffects. Ultrasound is also very attractive as a non-invasive, real-time, portable, and cost-effective imaging modality. Primary components of any new therapeutic technology (including IFUS) must include its ability for guidance and accurate monitoring of the treatment. Reliable quantitative ultrasound-based guidance and monitoring of the progression of treatment by measuring the thermo-mechanical changes in tissue at the beam focus is therefore needed for a successful therapy. The objective of the proposal is to establish and maintain an advanced research program in the area of non-invasive image-guided ultrasound surgery toward further improving efficacy and safety of the current technology and developing new applications in the areas of neurosurgery and pain management. The research proposal consists investigations in the following main areas. (a) Development of novel nonlinear ultrasound models to accurately and efficiently simulate the interaction of the IFUS beam with tissue and to predict the resulting thermal and mechanical bioeffects. (b) Design and development of a novel extra-corporeal image-guided dual-mode therapeutic ultrasound technology that makes use of combined mechanical and thermal effects of IFUS to improve treatment efficacy and safety. (c) Customization and application of the developed technology as a non-invasive image-guided surgery modality in neurosurgery and pain management. The proposal has strong potential to lead to scientific and technological breakthroughs in the field of non-invasive image-guided ultrasound surgery.

"The purpose of this proposal is to improve the existing technology and develop new technologies for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery and therapy that will reduce the burden on Canada's healthcare system by making surgeries and therapies more efficient and less traumatic and the hospital stays shorter. In robot-assisted soft-tissue surgeries, it is important to deliver haptic feedback (sensation of touch) about robot/patient contact forces to the surgeon's hand in order to enable better control over the forces and to prevent tissue damage. The proposed research focuses on various aspects of developing a satisfactory solution to the problem of lack of haptic feedback in current robot-assisted surgical and telesurgical systems. Specifically, focusing on the haptics technology bottlenecks, we plan to address the limitations caused by the electrical or mechanical imperfections of current surgical systems (tool flexibility, communication delay, robot joint's backlash and friction, etc.) both in terms of the surgical system's performance and characteristics and in terms of how well surgical examination and manipulation tasks can be performed using the system. While the benefits of minimally invasive methods to patients and the healthcare system are clear, we will magnify them by addressing the difficulties of robot-assisted surgery and by training HQP in the area. In addition, the research plans to develop new technologies that would enable a surgeon to use a robot-assisted surgical system for intracardiac surgery on the beating heart. The current practice is to stop the heart as heart motions are highly disturbing to the surgeon during the operation. For beating heart surgery to become possible, the key idea is to control a surgical robot such that it continuously follows the heart movements -- the beating heart will then seem steady to the surgeon. The proposed research will first look at real-time tracking of heart tissue structures within three-dimensional ultrasound images. The result, the tracked trajectory of a cardiac target in space, will be used to synchronize the surgical robot with the heart motions. The significance of the research is in that, unlike arrested-heart surgery, beating heart surgery will not involve cardiopulmonary bypass.","Robotic assistance for improving surgeries and therapies","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,Robotics
"The earliest market for fuel cells is seen in the portable sector because small fuel cells have an inherent higher energy density than batteries. Tekion is engaged in the commercialization of an energy system for portable power applications. However, improvement of their micro fuel cell is crucial to maintain their competitive edge. It is the aim of this project to improve the Tekion FormiraTM fuel cell which relies on a formic acid fuel cell. To achieve this objective, acid formic permeation through the membrane has to be reduced by at least 20%. This project addresses for the first time the improvement of Nafion membranes for formic acid fuel cells and the development of Nafion hybrid membranes is proposed. Our strategy rely on mixing the Nafion ionomer with inorganic bi-functional fillers (both hygroscopic and proton conductors) that will prevent or diminish formic acid cross-over without hampering the ionic conductivity. Two types of bi-functional fillers will be used: hydrous ruthenium oxide, RuO2.xH2O, a mixed electronic-protonic conductor with four times lower activation energy for proton transport than Nafion, and modified Faujasite zeolites, a high surface area molecular sieve, that will be acid stabilised (dealuminated) and functionalised with organic moieties containing sulfonic acid groups to improve their proton conductivity. Different configurations of mixed Nafion / RuO2.xH2O and Nafion / modified Faujasite zeolites will be prepared by solvent casting. The preparation procedure will be optimized to lower formic acid cross-over while maintaining without unduly affecting the membrane resistance.","Hybrid membranes for formic acid fuel cells","Energy storage and conversion",CANADA,CANADA,"Fuel and energy technology (economic geology, use 4003)"

"Mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) are an optimization problem in  which the essential constraints are defined by a parametric variational inequality or complementarity system. In a certain way, MPECs are an extension of the class of bilevel programs (BLP) or Stackelberg games. There are diverse applications that lend themselves to an MPEC formulation in optimal control (optimal prestress of cracked structures), engineering (dynamic rigid-body model, nonlinear obstacle problems), economics (Stackelberg games, transit planning, facility location, pricing, supply chain management).   Mathematically, the general MPECs are a highly non-convex, non-differentiable optimization problem that encompasses certain combinatorial features in its constraints. Hence, MPEC is very rich for both theoretical and algorithmic researchers.   The underlying data in MPEC are deterministic. However, in many applications, some data may involve stochastic (uncertain) factors and this makes a case for stochastic mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (SMPEC). Ignoring such stochastic factors may result in an optimal decision being made on the basis of a particular market realization which is not realistic. 

The consideration of uncertain data in engineering and economical hierarchical decision-making processes naturally leads to the formulation of such processes as SMPEC. SMPEC has been receiving more and more attention in the recent literature. This project raises the possibility of several novel contributions in both theoretical and algorithmic issues, and several applications will be studied.

"Road crashes are a major cause of deaths and injuries in Canada. In 2005, for example, motor vehicle collisions claimed the lives of 2,905 Canadians, in addition to causing 204,751 injuries. The annual social cost of road trauma is estimated at more than $25 billion. This innovative program of research aims to reduce the huge social cost of road crashes by identifying major contributing factors to road crashes and developing, implementing and evaluating road safety measures. Specifically, it will identify collision black-spots using various state-of-the-art methodologies. This research will also identify factors contributing to the frequency and severity of crashes at intersections and develop a holistic model that integrates concepts from transportation engineering with those from social and health sciences. Finally, it will evaluate an engineering measure that is expected to have a significant impact in reducing vehicle-pedestrian collisions at selected intersections.



This program of research is highly innovative and significant because it integrates highway engineering and planning with other disciplines such as economics, community health, psychology, and marketing into a holistic approach to improve road safety. Besides advancing knowledge in the field of road safety through fundamental and applied research in road safety and transportation engineering, the proposed program of research will contribute significantly to the government's objective to reduce the number of road users killed and seriously injured in Canada by 30%. It will provide evidence based recommendations to improve the safety and well being of all road users in Canada. Lastly, the proposed program of research will contribute significantly to the training of highly qualified personnel in road safety and elevate the overall professional competency in the field.

"Dairy products contain small amounts of naturally occurring trans fatty acids such as trans vaccenic acid (VA).  There is mounting evidence that naturally occurring trans fatty acids do not have the same negative effects on cardiovascular health as trans fatty acids produced industrially during food processing (for example, hydrogenation of vegetable oils).  However, there has been very limited research done on VA which is found in dairy products.  The overall goal of this project is to investigate whether VA has beneficial effects for lowering blood pressure (hypertension) and improving blood glucose control in an obese, insulin-resistant model.  VA can be converted in the body to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and our previous studies (funded by Dairy Farmers of Canada) provide evidence that the naturally occurring form of CLA in dairy products lowers blood pressure.  Thus, we want to determine whether the health benefits of VA are due to VA itself or due to conversion to CLA.  We will also investigate the role of adipose (fat) tissue and molecules secreted from adipose tissue on blood pressure and blood glucose control.  



This research is important because the incidence of obesity in children and adults is escalating, and obesity is a major risk factor for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.  Questions regarding the potential health benefits of naturally occurring trans fatty acids such as VA need to be clarified based on scientific studies.  This information is needed for refining dietary recommendations for dietary fat intake and consumption of dairy products.

"The research program has been investigating the role of zinc in immune function and antioxidant defense.  We have found that zinc deficiency does not alter the proportions of developing T cells in the thymus.  However, zinc deficiency reduces the proportion of the newly released T cells (which were produced in the thymus) when the subtypes of T cells in the blood and spleen are analyzed.  We have also found that a protein called 'Lck' is elevated in the T cells from the thymus and spleen of zinc-deficient rats.  We are proposing that the oxidative stress associated with zinc deficiency and changes in the intracellular free zinc contribute to altered cell signaling and the changes in immune cell types and functions.  The overall objective of the current application is to determine the effects of zinc deficiency and oxidative stress on various components of T cell signaling and the relationships with markers of cellular stress and intracellular zinc.  Another objective is to investigate the effects of dietary zinc deficiency and zinc supplementation on T cell subpopulations and T cell function in a model of chronic oxidative stress.  This research program contributes to the basic sciences understanding of nutritional immunology.

"The goals of my research program are to: (i) document the patterns of evolutionary divergence within and

among natural populations, (ii) test hypotheses concerning the origins of biodiversity from unique populations

to species, and (iii) apply such understanding to the conservation of biodiversity. The models used to address

these key questions in evolutionary biology are fishes of northwestern North America, including: evolutionary

lineages that were isolated in distinct glacial refugia (sticklebacks, trout, and char); populations that show

various degrees of physical separation via physical landform (e.g., migration barriers, watershed

interconnectedness in trout, char, and grayling) or ecology (adaptation to distinct habitats in trout and

sticklebacks); and species of closely related fishes that have come into contact (char and sticklebacks)

postglacially. The novel aspects of this research program include: integration of historical and contemporary

processes in divergence, comparative analyses of these processes in old (e.g., char) and more recent (e.g.,

sticklebacks) divergences, and the integration of molecular and ecological methods in hypothesis testing. For

instance, molecular phylogenetic, population genetic, and ecological methods have all been integrated into the

study of the historical factors that were involved in the formation of a contact zone between two char, Dolly

Varden and bull trout, in northwestern North America, and the processes that determine the current genetic

structure of the contact zone. The significance of this work, and related work on sticklebacks, includes

understanding the processes (such as the interactions among natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow)

that influence genetic variation within and between populations, and the ecological and genetic processes that

promote the evolution of new species. Most generally, all of these impacts are highly relevant to helping to

understand the origins of biodiversity - a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology as well as a necessary

pre-requisite to the conservation of biodiversity. Our work is also important for the training of young scientists

in areas of great need for Canada - aquatic and molecular ecology and biodiversity research.

"Acid soils are a major limitation to agricultural production worldwide. Factors that limit plant growth on these soils include aluminum (Al) toxicity and phosphate (Pi) deficiency. As a result, plant adaptation to acid soils requires mechanisms that confer tolerance to Al and mechanisms to enhance Pi acquisition. Preliminary analysis of gene expression experiments (transcriptome profiling of Al stress in Arabidopsis and Pi stress in canola) has identified an array of genes responsive to both stresses (co-expressed, potentially co-regulated). One striking observation was that both Al and Pi stress induced changes in expression of genes coding for many enzymes involved in carbon metabolism (glycolysis). An intriguing possibility is that increases in carbon flow through glycolysis are required to supply stress-specific metabolites not only for resistance to Al and Pi stress, but also for other abiotic stresses requiring a large allocation of carbon resources. To gain insight into plant responses to Al and Pi stress, we must identify and characterise the regulatory network(s) involved in these stress responses. The goal of the proposed research is to use current genetic, molecular, and computational tools to identify regulatory components of the Al and Pi stress response system(s) in Arabidopsis, and provide insight into the regulation of these pathways and the relationships they share. To identify components of the regulatory network(s), we will use two complementary techniques that detect interactions between DNA-binding proteins (e.g. transcription factors) and the DNA sequences to which they bind (e.g. cis-regulatory elements). The knowledge gained from this research will aid our long term goal of developing crop species better able to tolerate acid soils.","Transcriptional regulation of aluminum and phosphate stres-responsive genes in plants","Agriculture and primary food production",CANADA,CANADA,"Stress physiology"
"We now have strong evidence from many different types of astronomical observations that most of the matter in our universe is dark matter, an exotic substance that does not produce or interact with light almost at all. This dark matter, which manifests itself only through its gravitational effects, provides the scaffolding within which luminous structures such as galaxies can form, and thus it plays a vital role in cosmology. Furthermore, although the particle nature of dark matter is still unknown, the candidate particle or particles are constrained to lie outside the current 'standard model' of particle physics. Thus, the identification of dark matter is a top priority both for astrophysicists and for particle physicists. Knowing exactly where to look for dark matter is an important first step. The main goal of my research programme is to understand and to map out the distribution of dark matter in the universe, particularly on small scales where it is the most uncertain. Using novel computational techniques, I will model the dark matter distribution within our Galaxy and within our Solar System at unprecedented resolution. These models will be applied to the analysis of ongoing experiments in dark matter detection. I will also use gravitational lensing, the deflection of light as it passes through a gravitational field, to map small-scale dark matter structures in galaxy clusters, and to study how they evolve as clusters grow. Finally, I will search around the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies for very faint 'dwarf' galaxies that trace dark matter on the smallest scales.

"Gene duplication events are as common as individual nucleotide substitutions. Consequently, gene number differs to a large extent among individuals of the same species. The goal of my research program is to characterize the contribution of gene duplication to molecular and phenotypic diversity. The pattern of gene loss after duplication might have important implications for speciation (Taylor et al., 2001, Trends Genet, 17:299), however, the duplicates that are retained are the subjects of my current research. I focus on sensory receptors because this is where the link between molecular and phenotypic innovation is most clear. Project 1: Recent research in my lab shows that guppies have more Long Wavelength Sensitive opsin genes than any other vertebrate. We will test the hypothesis these 'extra' opsins improve colour vision using qPCR, in situ hybridization and, in collaboration with Dr. Kelber (University of Lund), colour discrimination tests. Guppies are colourful fish and our experiments will tell us if they also have especially good colour vision. Project 2: We were among the first to identify chemosensory genes in the purple sea urchin genome (Burke et al., 2006, Devel Biol, 300:434). We will carry out a PCR-based survey of cDNA to identify chemosensory organs (the sea urchin ""nose"") and in-situ hybridization to identify chemosensory cells. By expressing chemoreceptors in a cell line such as human embryonic kidney cells we will also study the responses of different chemoreceeptors to ligand stimulation by measuring changes in the levels of secondary messengers such as cAMP, IP3, or calcium. Project 3: We will study duplicated non-coding sequences upstream of chemoreceptor genes in Caenorhabditis elegans. Chemoreceptor genes make up one of the largest gene families in this species  (~2000 genes), yet most are expressed in one or more of only 32 chemosensory neurons. As many genes are expressed in the same neurons, they are expected to have similarities in the non-coding DNA that regulates gene expression.

"Premature births are common in Canada with about 1 in every 20 births requiring a protracted stay in intensive care. Modern technology and improvements in care have resulted in excellent survival rates but medical staff who care for premature infants and parents remain very concerned that at least half of them will have significant disabilities and many more will have problems at school. Our focus now is to try to better understand the acute problems that premature infants face as newborns, and how they may impact on the organs of the body, particularly the brain. An extremely common problem for premature infants is the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). This blood vessel is essential during fetal life and is the route through which placental blood reaches the baby's body. When the PDA fails to close after birth, it causes too much blood to flow into the lungs and at the same time diverts needed blood flow away from the brain and other vital organs. The consequences are serious and include lung, heart, bowel and brain damage. The current treatment for a PDA is either medication, surgery or both. The treatments themselves may also cause changes in blood flow to the brain circulation which could adversely affect the baby and be associated with the long term developmental and cognitive problems.  It is critical to assess the brain and its function in babies with PDA both before and after heart surgery and determine how the brain is affected by this treatment. The present proposal addresses this important clinical need. A multidisciplinary team of experts will develop tools to measure blood flow and activity in the brain and link these with comprehensive assessments of heart function and brain structure at four months of age. This will allow us to better understand the causes of brain injury in preterm infants and to focus targeted therapies for those most at risk.

"Working memory capacity is the number of items one can hold in mind at the same time.  This capacity increases gradually across childhood, and is related to intelligence and school performance.  Although memory improvements with age are associated with brain maturation, studies have not determined how specific areas in the brain or their maturational pattern are related to memory development.  We have recently designed a colour matching task which measures memory capacity in children in a six steps of increasing difficulty.  Children as young as 7 years can complete this task, but older children are able to do progressively more difficult levels.  

We have also established this task for brain imaging (fMRI) and have completed an adult study.  Brain activity increased in frontal areas (known to be important for working memory) with task difficulty, whereas other brain areas showed non-linear patterns.  

The purpose of this present project is: 1) using our task of memory capacity in children, we will use the fMRI protocol to identify which brain regions are critical to working memory across childhood and how this changes as the task becomes more difficult; 2) we will design a similar verbal task, which will also have six levels of difficulty.  We will test the verbal task behaviourally and then also using neuroimaging measures.  For each of these studies we will test 75 children between the ages of 7 and 16 years.  This project will pioneer the use of fMRI in studying working memory capacity in children, allowing us to understand the brain-behaviour relation.  These tasks and the measures of brain function will also be invaluable for future work studying children with difficulties in memory.

"The societal importance of catalysis is indisputable: catalysts are used in more than 90% of current chemical processes, ranging from large-scale preparations of bulk chemicals and polymers to the synthesis of complex drug molecules used to treat disease. Such processes contribute more than $1 trillion to the US economy alone. Not only can catalysis be used to accelerate otherwise impossible reactions or to selectively deliver a single product rather than a complex mixture, but this technology also has important implications for sustainable development. Thus, a tiny amount of catalyst can enable reactions that would otherwise require large amounts of conventional reagents, significantly reducing the amount of waste generated by a chemical process. 

     Controlling selectivity in catalysis is an important and ongoing challenge. Our research program will develop new strategies for controlling selectivity using interactions between molecules known as noncovalent interactions. This strategy takes inspiration from enzymes, nature's catalysts, which often display efficiencies and selectivities considerably higher than those achieved by synthetic catalysts developed in the laboratory. We plan to apply this strategy to important problems in organic chemistry with relevance to the preparation of fine chemicals, materials, and pharmaceutical agents. 

     Innovations arising from this research have the potential for diverse benefits. Reducing the environmental impact of chemical processes is a major goal of this program: projects in our laboratories are aimed at developing ""green"" catalysts that do not require harmful organic solvents, and at radically improving the efficiency of important chemical processes. Developing methods to prepare ""building blocks"" found in a wide range of biologically active compounds is a significant aspect of our research. In addition, personnel trained in this program will gain valuable skills that are in high demand across a wide range of sectors in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and will be well-equipped to become leaders in Canada's workforce.

"The primary focus of my research program is to develop new methods for synthesizing molecules that can be used in the construction of biologically important compounds and evaluate selected compounds as lead structures for the design of therapeutic agents and for elucidating mechanisms of medicinally significant enzymes.  The first subject of this proposal concerns the synthesis of chiral organofluorines where the fluorine is attached to a stereogenic carbon.  This will be achieved using a novel class of chiral N-fluorosulfonimides which we anticipate will act as enantioselective electrophilic fluorinating agents.  Compounds resulting from these studies are important as they have potential as useful intermediates in organic synthesis and as probes and inhibitors of enzymes and other proteins.  The second part of this proposal deals with the design, synthesis and evaluation of inhibitors of a class of enzymes know as sulfatases. One such sulfatase, steroid sulfatase (STS), is considered to be a potential target for the treatment of breast cancer.  The mechanism of a series of novel fluorine-bearing, irreversible, suicide STS inhibitors will be elucidated and evaluated for their potential for performing live imaging of STS in breast cancer cell lines.  Novel aldehyde-based irreversible active site directed inhibitors will also be explored.  A new steroid binding site recently discovered as a result of our collaboration with a protein crystallographer will also be exploited for developing non-competitive STS inhibitors.  We will also examine a series of unique fluorinated carbohydrate sulfonates as inhibitors of H. pylori sulfatase, an enzyme that is believed to contribute to the severity of gastric diseases caused by this bacterium.  The third part of this proposal focuses on developing a new class of sulfating agents called sulfuryl imidazolium salts (SIS's) recently prepared for the first time in the Taylor laboratory.  The next generation of SIS's will be prepared with superior stability and sulfating properties.  These will be used to construct complex and physiologically important sulfated biomolecules such as sulfated oligosaccharides and peptides.","Studies in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Bio-organic chemistry"

"Many natural systems in nature, such as trees, river networks and cardiovascular systems, are branching systems.  Fractal trees provide mathematical models for branching systems.  My research will shed new light on mathematical aspects of fractal trees, as well as develop new results for applications of fractal trees.  

There are many different classes of fractal trees.  A simple class are symmetric binary fractal trees.  A tree in this class is described by a scaling ratio r and a branching angle theta.  A trunk of unit length splits into two branches, each of length r and forming an angle of theta (one to the left, one to the right).  The branching is continued ad infinitum following the same rule.  I have studied this class of trees using methods of topology.  Topology involves a type of geometry that ignores concrete spatial notions like straightness and distance, but considers properties like connectivity (holes, number of components, etc) and continuity.  Through this type of analysis, new characterizations and classifications of fractals trees continue to be developed. 

To date, there has been much research on natural systems and fractal dimension.  This has proved to be quite fruitful, but the fractal dimension does not fully characterize a fractal.  I am working with various collaborators in the natural sciences to find ways to use the new mathematical results in applications.

There are interesting geometrical properties of fractal trees as well.  For example, there is a remarkable connection between four special trees and the famed `divine proportion'.  Thus another aspect of my research involves an investigation of other geoemtrical properties, such as tilings.

Finally, with collaborators, we are exploring how to use different logics to describe and characterize fractal trees, and fractals in general.  

My research program has different facets, ranging from the use of fractal tree models in the natural world to beautiful geometrical properties of the trees themselves, and will have a broad impact on the current knowledge of fractal trees.

"My research interests lie in the area of geometric functional analysis and are mostly devoted to the study of

geometry of infinite dimensional Banach spaces.



One project I intend to investigate deals with the existence of invariant subspaces for bounded operators. While

the complete solution is still elusive, significant progress has been achieved over the years. I intend to approach

similar type of questions from a new direction. Replacing the concept of ""invariance"" with a suitable concept of

""almost invariance"" seem to open this problem to stabilization methods and techniques specific to

combinatorial Ramsey theory. I investigated and applied these type of techniques for my doctoral project and I

intend to develop the general method further, hoping to bring some fresh ideas in attacking this problem.



Another project is concerned with the construction of a Banach space which does not contain l_p, c_0 or any

reflexive subspace, yet it has nontrivial type, thus answering a question of Gowers. The existence of such a

space would shed more light on the structure of infinite dimensional Banach spaces. Combining methods

developed by Gowers and Maurey with a classical construction by James of a space which is uniformly

non-octahedral seem to indicate a promising line of attack for this problem. I intend to build a hereditary

version of the James' space, while forcing all subspaces to inherit the geometric properties of the space

constructed by Gowers.



In another project, currently at a very incipient stage, I intend to study the realization of spreading models in the

ultrapowers or nonstandard hulls of the underlying space.

"The increasingly numerous and diverse Earth observation satellite systems can contribute information of significant value, provided developments in the physical underpinnings keep pace.  A major challenge with these systems is to ensure that similar measurements by different sensor systems under different observational conditions yield physically consistent and accurate geophysical and biophysical data.  The first research theme explores the feasibility of a new coordinated satellite imaging sensor calibration capability based on a global network of approximately six ground-based benchmark test sites.  The concept is to standardize on a core set ground instruments and measurement protocols across all sites and to have the measurements undergo identical processing.  Such a network will provide calibration data for all optical satellite systems currently in operation, reduce significantly the effort required by individual agencies, and provide consistency for studies involving multiple satellites.  The proof-of-concept research will be carried out at Railroad Valley Playa, Nevada.  The second research theme considers whether there exists a unique relationship between vegetation canopy architecture and the canopy's reflectance as a function of observation angle.  Digital imaging spectrometers will be used at ground level to acquire high-spatial-resolution spectral image data as a function of angle over crop canopies in order to investigate at what spatial scale the angular signatures reach those observed by a satellite imaging sensor.  The research is designed to improve canopy reflectance models used with satellite image data in operational crop monitoring.  The proof-of-concept research will be carried out for potatoes and sugar beets in Southern Alberta.  Overall, the proposed research is intended to improve the accuracies of change detection in resource monitoring applications and guide the directions of new remote sensing research efforts.

"In the last few decades, developments in physics, chemistry, and engineering, such as the ever-increasing miniaturization of devices, the emergence of the quantum-computation paradigm, or the desire to influence molecular reactions and to manipulate condensates of ultra-cold atoms (Bose-Einstein condensates), have triggered a growing interest in controlling systems at the quantum scale; i.e., systems that are critically influenced by quantum effects. This research project is aimed at contributing to the theory of the emerging field of ""quantum engineering'' by investigating the control properties of the fundamental equation of quantum theory, the Schrï¿½dinger equation (and its nonlinear variants). The basic question is whether a given control objective (such as the preparation of an excited or superposition state, the transfer of a Bose-Einstein condensate, or the increase in the yield of a molecular reaction) can be realized by applying suitably designed control fields (usually laser fields) to the system. Although the mathematical control theory for partial differential equations is well developed and many equations arising in physics and engineering have been studied in great detail, the theory for Schrï¿½dinger's equation is less complete. This research project is aimed at closing this gap. The results of this research may potentially have implications for areas such as semiconductor technology, nanoscience, or quantum computing.

"Emerging wireless communication networks are enabling a variety of applications ranging from critical infrastructure protection and security, to environment monitoring, health care and quality of life. Various types of current and emerging wireless network architectures include cellular networks, wireless local area networks, wireless ad hoc networks, wireless personal area networks, and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) systems. Moreover, future fourth-generation radio access is anticipated to provide data rates up to 100 Mb/s with wide-area coverage and up to 1 Gb/s with local-area coverage that can be achieved by using sophisticated and computationally powerful transceivers. Classical communication theory is based on a competitive framework in which different users and applications compete for resources such as bandwidth and power. However, recent research has demonstrated that cooperative strategies can significantly improve the overall capacity of wireless networks. These strategies exploit the intuitive notion that intermediate nodes can assist data transmission between the source and the destination nodes and facilitate the realization of low-cost virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Cooperative networks require the development of appropriate channel and frequency estimation methods, practical coding and decoding techniques, beamforming, and MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing techniques. Our main focus is therefore on the development of intelligent signal processing techniques for cooperative networks. We will utilize recent advances in robust beamforming, modern coding theory, space-time signal processing, and cooperative strategies to significantly improve the throughput, scalability, reliability and performance of cooperative wireless networks. The successful project outcomes will thus enable high capacity, ubiquitous wireless network infrastructures with end-to-end broadband capability.

"    )	During the last deglaciation, Lake Agassiz was the largest lake on earth, and periodically released large volumes of water into the oceans through 4 different routes, which impacted on the way oceans circulated.  Lake Agassiz overflow has been implicated in triggering the Younger Dryas -- an anomalous and global 1000-year-long cold episode that punctuated postglacial warming.  New evidence, however, has left this conclusion in doubt. Climate modelers need to have this issue resolved so they can evaluate the potential impact of freshwaters on ocean circulation and climate.

    )	To resolve this uncertainty, field studies, including coring, stratigraphic analysis, and age dating, will be conducted in the two outlet regions of Lake Agassiz that may have carried overflow from the lake during the Younger Dryas -- the Eastern outlet into Lake Superior and the North Atlantic Ocean, and the Northwestern outlet into the Clearwater-Athabasca-Mackenzie system to the Arctic Ocean.

    )	The recent discovery at >50 sites in North America of a deposit containing extraterrestrial (ET) components, deposited at the start of the Younger Dryas (~12,900 yrs ago), is critical in evaluating both the cause of the Younger Dryas and the drainage of Lake Agassiz and other ice-marginal lakes in the Canadian Prairies at about the same time.  This ET sedimentary unit contains an Iridium anomaly, carbon micro-spherules and glass, and other high temperature ET components such as nanodiamonds.

"The proposed research program focuses on the applications of supercritical fluid technology to Canada's natural biological resources to obtain high quality value-added products without the use of organic solvents. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the supercritical fluid of choice for food applications. CO2 becomes supercritical (SC) at temperature and pressure conditions above its critical point (31 C, 7.4 MPa). Following extraction, CO2 separates as a gas upon pressure reduction leaving no solvent residue in the extracted product. This is especially important in the rapidly growing field of nutraceuticals since the consumers are demanding ""natural"" extracts. Recently, there has been a tremendous growth in the supercritical fluid extraction of such health benefiting components from various plant materials at industrial scale. Development of technology through better understanding of the fundamental principles governing this process and evaluation of the products are the main focus of this research program. The use of supercritical fluids in this program involves the unit operations of extraction, fractionation, reactions and particle formation applied to lipids and nutraceuticals. The next phase of our research will focus on enhancing our understanding of fundamentals in terms of solubility and melting behavior of lipids/nutraceuticals in the presence of high pressure CO2. As well, various physical properties necessary for engineering modeling will be determined. A major focus will be particle formation techniques targeting micro/nano encapsulated particles to design novel delivery systems for nutraceuticals targeting different functional food formulations. Novel process development will be continued with combinations of extractor, fractionation column, reactors and nozzles for particle formation to obtain high-value products. The nutraceuticals of interest are omega-3 fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acid, phytosterols, tocopherols and carotenoids, which have been demonstrated to be beneficial against cardiovascular heart diseases and cancer.

"Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere are believed to be the cause of current realized global warming. Agriculture is an important source of greenhouses, particularly nitrous oxide. Like all sectors of the economy, agriculture is expected to reduce its emissions. Perennial crops are important for livestock feed and will increasingly be used for biofuel production. This research program examines the multiple benefits of inclusion of perennials in crop rotations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase soil health. Perennials utilize nitrogen fertilizers and manures better than annual crops, which could reduce nitrous oxide emissions. Perennials may also lower the amount of fertilizer nitrogen lost to the atmosphere as the non-greenhouse gas, nitrogen gas. Lowering the loss of fertilizer nitrogen increases profitability and avoids direct greenhouse gas emissions from soil and emissions related to manufacturing and transporation of fertilizer. Legume perennials supply their own nitrogen nutrition and are not dependent upon nitrogen fertilizer addition, this reduces greenhouse gas emissions from fertilizers associated with direct emissions from soil, manufacturing and transportation, however emissions of nitrous oxide from legume produced nitrogen is uncertain. Perennials have more extensive rooting systems than annual crops, storing more carbon in soil thus lowering emissions of greenhouse gases. In the long term, perennial cover alters soil food webs to more diverse organisms, particularly beneficial fungi associated with the roots (called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and higher trophic soil organisms, their effect on shorter terms of 3 years within cropping systems is uncertain. Recently it has been demonstrated that these fungi provide a form of carbon, call glomalin, that builds soil organic matter and improves soil structure. This program aims to discover if conversion from the perennial to annual phase in crop rotations, releases carbon and nitrogen stored in soil as greenhouse gases. Similarly, the program aims to resolved if glomalin and diversity of soil food webs is retained upon conversion from perennial to annual phases of cropping systems thus improving soil health.

"Circoviruses are small, non-enveloped icosahedral viruses that are emerging as important pathogens of several animal species. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) was first discovered in Canada in 1991 as the infectious agent for post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), a progressive disease that occurs in piglets. Since its original discovery, PCV-2 has been identified world-wide as an important pathogen causing significant economic losses in swine herds. Similarly, the etiological agent of infectious chicken anemia, chicken anemia virus (CAV) has also been shown to be a circovirus and controlling outbreaks of this virus

during intensive poultry farming is costly and disruptive. In addition, circoviruses have been identified as a disease causing agent in several other wild bird species and the impact of this virus class will likely continue to increase. Despite the importance of circoviruses to livestock industries and their widespread presence in mammalian and avian hosts, very little is understood about the biology of this unique virus family. The circoviruses are grouped together as a family based on common genome structure. Circovirus genomes are small and circular, which gives the family its name. The small size of the genome dictates that very few proteins can be encoded and depending on the isolate, circovirues produce only 3-5 proteins. In the case of both PCV-2 and CAV, pathogenicity of the virus is due to expression of a single protein, designated VP3, which causes extensive cell death in infected tissues. Interestingly, the VP3 proteins of both CAV and PCV-2 seem to be dispensable for viral replication yet are the cause of disease in infected animals. The research program we are proposing will study the mechanism of action of VP3 from several animal circoviruses to obtain a better understanding of the pathology caused by these viruses.","Biology of circoviruses","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)",CANADA,CANADA,Virology

"Animal morphogenesis is a fascinating and challenging area of modern biology. Many of the mechanisms that regulate cell and tissue shape are still poorly understood although abnormal morphogenesis is the cause of many human diseases. We use the fruit fly as a powerful genetic model system and we have studied several aspects of the development of the Drosophila eye to understand the formation of the architecture of complex cells and tissues. We will continue our work on the formation of the interrhabdomeral space, an epithelial lumen that is found at the centre of every ommatidium of the compound eye of a fly. Many organs contain tubes where epithelial cells surround a central lumen. Examples include lungs, liver, kidneys or the vascular system. Not only the formation and maintenance, but also the regulation of lumen shape (e.g. its diameter), are important determinants of organ function. 



We have characterized the first gene required for the formation of the interrhaddomeral space. The gene is called eyes shut (eys) and encodes a highly glycosylated protein of the proteoglycan family that is secreted into the luminal space between the photoreceptor cells. Our findings represent one of two compelling recent examples that suggest that the secretion of an apical matrix is critical for lumen formation. The Drosophila eye has been intensely studied over the last 2 decades and many technical tools have been developed. This together with our expertise in using the fly retina as an experimental system provides us with a unique opportunity to analyze the function of an apical matrix in lumen morphogenesis. The goal of our research program is to understand the molecular function of the Eys proteoglycan and the role of glycosylation in the formation of the interrhabdomeral space. Moreover, we will investigate the mechanism that controls the targeted secretion of Eys into the luminal space. Given the widespread occurrence of lumen formation during organogenesis we anticipate that our findings will have broad significance for the understanding of animal morphogenesis.

"Dendritic cells (DCs) are a key component of the immune system. These cells sample the gut epithelium engulfing pathogenic bacteria into intracellular compartments known as phagosomes. Inside phagosomes bacteria are killed and digested. Distinctive bacterial components, like protein fragments, are then presented by DCs to the lymphocytes. This action activates lymphocytes, which will fight the bacterial infection. 

The lumen of the intestine is colonized by large numbers of beneficial bacteria known as commensal flora (CF).  The gut's immune system tolerates the presence of CF, but simultaneously needs to fight pathogenic bacteria. These events are tightly regulated and a failure in this in equilibrium will make CF the target of the host immune response, leading to diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  

Recent evidence indicates that CF can survive inside DC phagosomes. Similarly, several pathogens like the food poisoning agent Salmonella can escape killing and survive inside DCs' phagosomes, ultimately disrupting DC functions. The mechanisms associated with these phenomena are poorly understood.

The overall goals of this project are to investigate the nature and morphogenesis of the intracellular compartment occupied by bacteria in DCs and the cellular functions altered by bacteria to escape killing. A better understanding of how pathogenic and commensal bacteria manipulate DCs will shed light on the cellular mechanisms responsible for the control of bacterial infection and tolerance to commensal flora.

"Summary - Direct Hydrocarbon Fuel Cells



Fuel cells convert the chemical energy of a fuel to electrical energy.  Theoretically they can do this with greater energy efficiency than conventional electrical power plants.  If less fuel is used to generate the same amount of electrical energy, then there will be fewer emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.  Presumably this will diminish global warming and climate change.  Theoretical considerations indicate that this expectation cannot be achieved by using the hydrogen fuel cells currently being developed.  The same analysis shows that direct hydrocarbon fuel cells can be both more energy efficient and more environmentally friendly than hydrogen fuel cells.  With this technology a hydrocarbon fuel is consumed directly in the electrochemical reaction of a fuel cell, without previously being converted to hydrogen, methanol, or any other species.  It has several advantages.  It eliminates the need for a fuel processor that is used to produce hydrogen.  The capital cost (30% of the total) and the efficiency loss (25% of the fuel energy) caused by the endothermic steam reforming are both eliminated.  In addition direct hydrocarbon fuel cells have a smaller efficiency loss caused by entropy change (12% of the fuel energy) than hydrogen fuel cells.  Unfortunately direct hydrocarbon fuel cells have a disadvantage.  They have small current densities, which means they require large reactors.  The objective of this project is to understand and improve the operation of direct hydrocarbon fuel cells by performing computational studies.  Specifically this project will (1) try to identify improved fuel cell electrocatalysts by using density functional theory, and (2) try to identify improved fuel cell reactor configurations and materials by using computational fluid dynamics.  By performing computational studies, the intention is to identify materials, reactor configurations, and operating procedures that give a sufficiently promising performance in order to warrant subsequent experimental investigations in the laboratory.

"In the past ten years, open source software (OSS) has grown from a grassroots community of hobbyists to an integral part of business, government, education, and research. However, the successes of OSS have largely been in the area of systems software, software such as operating systems, databases, and web servers. My research interest is in making open source software more usable by improving the open source software design process.



My long-term research goal is to develop self-sustaining usability infrastructures for the open source community that require little cost to set up and maintain, yet which demonstrably improve usability practices. This goal encompasses two high-level research problems not previously investigated by the human-computer interaction community: 1) How to transform existing usability tools and techniques to function effectively within the resource-constrained, distributed, and public development environments of the OSS community, and 2) How to leverage the unique features of the OSS community to yield new usability tools and methods not possible in closed-source software development. Importantly, the open source community presents a unique opportunity for developing new human-centric software design processes that are not limited by the constraints of the marketplace or the need to sell the software.

"Ageing civil infrastructure is costing Canadian municipalities over $1 billion dollars every year in terms of

rehabilitation and replacement. Civil infrastructure systems can be classified as bridges, pipelines, roads, etc.

Each of these systems can be further sub-classified as vertical components (e.g. electric poles, bridges) and

linear components (e.g., pipelines, roads). The vertical components are typically confined and their inspection

is technically straightforward. On the other hand, the linear component may extend to thousands of kilometers

even for moderate-size municipalities, which make their inspection and condition assessment quite

challenging. Furthermore, the cities have limited budget, as a result, spending on proactive management is

limited. Roads are linear infrastructure and consist of roughly 50% of the total municipal assets in terms of $

values.

The proposed project will develop a decision support tool (DST) to assist decision-makers in the planning and

management of the road assets for resource and fund allocations. The proposed DST will be a risk-based

system that will incorporate probability of occurrence and severity of damages due to different natural hazards

(earthquake, climate change, etc.) and operational use (traffic volume, truck loads, etc.). The significance of

this research is paramount as it directly contributes to the improved safety and security against variety of

hazards of varying magnitudes. This research will guide to a sustainable solution for the management of road

"Many regions, both in the eastern and western provinces of Canada, are prone to moderate to high seismic hazards. Reported seismic induced damages of the 1994 Northridge earthquake highlighted vulnerability of North American infrastructure systems. The seismic hazards, coupled with older, vulnerable infrastructures, pose the potential for damage and loss of life. The economic impact of seismic induced damage, on the Lower Mainland of British Columbia alone, has been estimated at 14.3 to 32.1 billion dollars. Evaluating and retrofitting every vulnerable building is costly undertaking, and requires a risk-based prioritization. Risk analysis focuses on identifying potential failure scenarios in terms of the probability of occurrence and consequences. Risk management is a process of selecting and implementing strategies to mitigate damages and minimize the consequences of failure. 

The objectives of this research program is to develop a pragmatic risk assessment and management tool through:

i) developing a seismic risk index tool to aid in the allocation of emergency funds by federal and provincial decision makers;

ii) building upon the applicant's CanRisk model and utilize non-linear structural analysis to quantify the building damageability, and develop risk assessment tool, by considering different uncertainties and optimization techniques; and

iii) developing a novel risk management framework. 

The risk assessment and management tools will be unique and it is also envisaged that using this risk assessment and management framework, and incorporating real-time data, a decision making tool for Canadian earthquake risk mitigation and emergency response can be developed. As well, these tools can be used in international context, and aid in training of highly qualified personnel.

"How is it that memories are encoded into the brain?  Most behavioural neuroscientists agree that memories are instantiated into the brain through changes in the connection strengths between neurons which in turn causes a restructuring of neural circuits.  Exploring this ""synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis"" within the mammalian neocortex has become of interest to me.  I propose to analyze of the effects of learned skilled behaviour on brain change.  This research proposal is based on the specific hypothesis that the properties of potentiation phenomena and learning & memory are homologous.  I will detail the mechanisms of brain plasticity within the sensorimotor neocortex of the rat brain using both synaptic potentiation phenomena and skilled-learning paradigms.  I will advance our knowledge of learning and memory by determining a) the consequences of enriched experience on development, b) the activation properties of neural networks on behaviour, c) the synaptic basis of behavioural generation, d) determining the effect of experience on somatosensory organization, and e) role of synaptic potentiation on skilled learning. These innovative experiments will allow us to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for learning and memory in the mammalian neocortex and this will ultimately lead to the creation of treatments for learning disorders and memory loss.","Plasticity of sensorimotor neocortex",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Behavioural neuroscience"

"Ce projet de recherche consiste a mettre au point un procede afin de produire line molecule biologique appelee

ï¿½ surfactin ï¿½ par des techniques de fermentation. Cette molecule est en fait un surfactant produit par une

bacterie appelee Bacillus subtilis. Les surfactants permettent de reduire la tension superficielle entre deux

"Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) affect more than

one million Canadians. Most autoimmune diseases are the results of misdirected inflammation. Sadly, while

the overall mortality rates in the general population has declined substantially over the last decade, patients

with autoimmune diseases have not experienced the same improvements in survival. In addition, aging of

population contributes to the increase of autoimmune disease cases monitored every year in North America. A

better control of chronic inflammation is therefore urgently needed to improve the quality of life of these

patients.

The pathogenesis of these disorders is not well understood. However, several cytokines have been identified as

important players in inflammatory diseases. Indeed, anti-cytokine therapeutic agents have had a profound effect

on the treatment of patients with arthritis and IBD. However, 40% of patients with Crohn disease or arthritis,

and most with ulcerative colitis do not respond to anti-TNF therapy. Attention has been focused on the well

known cytokines to now, but few studies have examined the role of alarmins in these diseases. Alarmins are

small intracellular proteins released upon cell necrosis or activation which exhibit cytokine-like activities when

released in the extracellular milieu. Examples of alarmins include the High Mobility Group Box-1 and

S100A8/A9 proteins. Increasing evidences point toward a pivotal role for alarmins in chronic inflammation

and autoimmune diseases in general.

In this proposal, we propose to confirm the important role of alarmins in auto immune diseases using two

animal models for rheumatoid arthritis and IBD. In brief, we will:

1) Identify new therapeutic targets for the control of chronic inflammation by a combination of proteomic and

genomic approaches. We intend to determine cytokine and alarmin release in mouse models of arthritis

(collagen-induced arthritis) and inflammatory bowel diseases (TNBS and oxazolone models). DNA chips will

allow following cytokine expression at the inflammatory site, while 2D gels, LC-MS/MS and multiplex

analyses of serum and tissue samples will determine cytokine and alarmin secretion.

2) Validate the therapeutic targets by examining the effect of candidate neutralizing drugs in the same models.

We will identify high affinity peptides binding specifically to the targets identify in the previous section.

Because peptides are usually unstable in vivo, we will fused them to the nucleocapsid (NC) of a plant virus

(PapMV; papaya mosaic virus) platform to improve its stability. Furthermore, PapMV NC self-assembles into

a 20mer disk upon expression in bacteria from which it can be easily purified. The multimerization of the

peptide on this platform is likely to improve the avidity of the complex for their target and increase the

neutralizing property of the fusion protein as compared to the use of the unstable synthetic peptide.

Alternatively, the peptides will be added to the protein cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) pIII, which

spontaneously forms tetramers. Both proteins have been selected because they have been studied extensively in

Dr Leclerc's laboratory, are highly stable, easy to purify in large quantities, resistant to proteases and

non-immunogenic in mouse. Efficacy of the immunotherapy drugs will then be tested in the same mouse

models of arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.

This research project is a unique collaboration between a researcher investigating autoimmune diseases and a

specialist on protein engineering and viral assembly. Together, we have solid experience of mouse models of

autoimmune diseases and protein engineering and have access to state-of-the-art genomic and proteomic

facilities. A successful outcome will uncover much needed new potential targets for pharmacologic or biologic

intervention and further extend our knowledge of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.","Identification and validation of new therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases","Not available",CANADA,CANADA,"Medical sciences"

"The main objective of the proposal is the continued study of the computational complexity of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). CSP offer a unified framework to analyze a wide variety of computational problems that occur naturally in many areas of computer science, most notably in artificial intelligence, database theory and combinatorial optimization. 

Over the last ten years, a vast research program has sought to develop the tools required to distinguish between cases of CSP solvable in polynomial time from those which are NP-complete and thus unlikely to be solvable efficiently. This research has been driven by two complementary approaches based respectively on logic and algebra. The present proposal aims to further the interaction between these two approaches and to initiate a more fine-grained analysis of the complexity of CSP. Indeed, among CSP solvable in polynomial time, one can further distinguish those computable in models with even tighter resource constraints. For CSP over the boolean domain it is for instance known that every non-trivial CSP is complete for one of the complexity classes Logspace, non-deterministic logspace, parity-counting-logspace, polynomial time (P) or NP. 

The long-term objective is to precisely classify the computational complexity of any subcase of CSP. I intend to build on my recent work which used the algebraic approach to obtain promising initial results in that respect. 

The logical approach to CSP has tied the existence of efficient algorithms for subcases of CSP with the expressibility of that CSP in a particular fragment of the database-theory inspired logic-programming language Datalog and some of its fragments. In particular, my co-authors and I recently introduced ""symmetric Datalog"" and demonstrated its connection with CSP solvable in logarithmic space. As a short term objective, I want to further understand the expressive power of symmetric Datalog and potentially, characterize it algebraically.

"The objective of this proposal is to improve our fundamental understanding of the regulation of plastid metabolic pathways in higher plants. In particular, the research program will investigate the regulatory mechanisms governing tocopherol biosynthesis in oilseed plastids, the organization of the pathway within developing organelles, and its relationship to other major metabolic pathways. Tocopherols and tocotrienols are an important group of lipid-soluble antioxidants synthesized exclusively in photosynthetic tissues, with many beneficial properties, both with respect to human health (e.g. vitamin E activity), and within the food industry as stabilizers and preservatives, and are therefore a valuable by-product of major oilseed crops such as soybean (Glycine max L.). We plan to take multi-disciplinary approaches to understanding the regulation and organization of tocopherol and tocotrienol biosynthesis both in leaf chloroplasts of Arabidopsis (a genetically amenable plant and also an oilseed) and photoheterotrophic plastids of developing oilseeds such as soybean. Specifically, these techniques will be employed to examine the components of the pathway within plastids (inner membranes, and sub-plastidial compartments such as the plastoglobules), and identify other, as yet undiscovered, proteins interacting with components of the tocopherol biosynthetic pathway, e.g. regulatory factors or elements of signal transduction cascades and intra-plastidial trafficking systems. This research will provide important insights into the mechanisms governing the control and regulation of important metabolic pathways in the plastids of higher plants, and contribute to engineering crops with improved nutritional value and enhanced high-value bioproducts.

"Improving the performance of thermal equipment used in the power industry can strongly contribute in re- ducing environmental impacts of burning fuels. In addition, nuclear power plants produce electricity without emissions. Thus, the nuclear technology is now at the foreground of the power industry. A better design of thermal systems can help in reducing conventional plant emissions as well as to guarantee the safe operation of nuclear stations. Therefore, this proposal presents a program intended to study several subjects that could help in improving the efficiency of conventional and nuclear power plants. These subjects are: i) Pressure Losses in Boiling Fluids: their prediction is essential for dimensioning thermal equipment and consequently reducing energy waste. They are calculated with empirical correlations developed from data. In boiling experiments, water is commonly replaced by other fluids. The data is converted into water equivalent values by scaling laws that have been verified only under Critical Heat Flux (CHF) flow conditions. A Freon loop will be used for performing experiments under high-pressure water equivalent flow conditions different from CHF. ii) Flow Distribution in a Full Size Rod Bundle Assembly: pressure losses and heat transfer in fuel channels depend on two-phase flow patterns. A transparent rod-bundle simulation assembly will be manufactured for performing two-phase distribution experiments with air-water mixtures. The flow will be characterized by measuring among other parameters, the local void fractions. iii) Subchannel Analysis: fuel channel thermalhydraulic analyses are carried out with subchannel codes. For calculating lateral mixing effects, these codes require empirical constants to be selected by the user. These parameters, however, depend on local conditions a priori not known. A genetic algorithm coupled to an objective function will be used in a horizontal subchannel model for optimizing lateral mixing without user intervention. iv) 3-D Modeling of the Candu Calandria Vessel: it is intended to introduce more modern simulation techniques than those commonly employed in the nuclear industry. Simulated local flow and temperatures will be used in nuclear safety analyses.

"This project will look at the feasibility of combining adsorption technology and fundamentals to hybrid processes and hybrid materials for improving the energy sustainability of our society. Following 2 Major projects will be undertaken for the proposed study: 1) Hybrid Processes: The objectives of this study will be to design and optimize hybrid adsorption/distillation systems for separation of olefins and paraffins. The addition of an adsorption unit onto a distillation column has a potential to significantly decrease the energy use of the distillation column for olefin-paraffin separations. The project will start with designing new adsorbent materials and looking at their performances for olefin and paraffin separations at different operating conditions. It will then continue with coupling the adsorption system with the distillation unit for optimizing operating conditions and different combinations of the hybrid adsorption/distillation process for minimizing energy use for olefin production. 2) Hybrid Materials: The objectives of this study will be to design and optimize hybrid adsorbent/membrane materials for separation of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen gases, with applications in removal of green house gases from air, as well as in obtaining renewable energy sources, such as producing natural gas from landfill gas. Preparation methods of adsorbent membranes will be optimized by studying behaviour of pure gases as well as their mixtures with these materials. The results of this study will advance our fundamental understanding of separation mechanisms that take place when adsorbent membranes are employed for gas separations. 

The results obtained in this study will significantly advance our knowledge on separation processes by enabling engineers to design separation systems which would have been impossible without the combined hybrid systems/materials. It will enable us to use sustainable energy sources such as land-fill gas. 3 Ph.D. students and 20 undergraduate students working on their thesis will take part on this project during the 5 year tenure of this proposed funding.

"Galaxies of different types and age exhibit different clustering statistics. Thus, an understanding of galaxy formation and evolution is a prerequisite to understanding the large-scale distribution of galaxies. Successful analysis of the next generation of galaxy surveys will be partially determined by how far we advance our knowledge of galaxy formation in the immediate future. Moving the boundaries of our knowledge forward requires that we use state-of-the-art numerical simulation techniques to create virtual universes that contain simulated galaxies within them. By changing the underlying physics models we can study the collective effect of the billions of stars that make up a single galaxy. The birth, evolution and death of stars, along with an unseen dark matter component, all combine to determine the parameters of galaxies, such as rotation speed and luminosity. The research outlined in this proposal will systematically improve our knowledge of the role of star formation in galaxy evolution while at the same time examining issues in large-scale structure. Most importantly, the first simulation of an entire galaxy with sufficient resolution to pick out individual massive stars will be undertaken. The information drawn from this landmark simulation will allow us to test not only theories of galaxies but also those of the interstellar medium that exists between stars.

1. Let p be an odd prime number, n>0, z a primitive p^n-th root of 1 and b=p^(1/p^n). Let Qp be the field of p-adic numbers, K=Qp(z,b) and P the prime ideal of its ring of integers. The field extension K/Qp is totally ramified. After a question posed by Adrian Iovita, I intend to search for a uniformizing parameter for K/Qp; that is, an element t in K such that P=(t). Later on, I intend to work in the more general problem, stated by Filippo Viviani, of finding a uniformizing parameter for L/Qp, where L=Qp(z,a^(1/p^n)), and a is an integer such that either p does not divide a or p divides exactly a.

2. We are interested in finding families of cyclic monic polynomials of degree m>2 with integer coefficients and constant terms 1 or -1. Those families generalize a quintic family of cyclic polynomials found by Emma Lehmer and used by Schoof an Washington to construct a real p-cyclotomic field with class number divisible by a large prime. We found some ways to construct such kind of families of polynomials and calculated some interesting examples. We believe that with a more efficient implementation of our algorithms, and the use of faster computers, we can find many new examples.

3. Let p be an odd prime, z a primitive p-th root of 1, A the Sylow p-subgroup of the ideal class group of Q(z), G the Galois group of Q(z)/Q and w the Teichmuller character of G with values in Zp. We found some criteria to know when, for n and t odd, with e=(p-1)/n small, the w^(p-nt) component of A is trivial. This is related to Vandiver's conjecture. Recently Robert Osburn used our results to give an alternative proof of the fact that, when p=3 mod 4, the w^((p+1)/2) component of A is trivial. There e=2. We will work in extending that result to other values of e.

"Materials science and chemistry are concerned with the design and characterization of novel materials for use by society. Traditionally, this is done by experimental work. Another approach is to make predictions using computational models based on theory. This research concerns predictions of the properties of molecules and interactions between pairs of molecules using a mixture of theoretical and computational work. There are many advantages to theoretical and computational work. It allows us to consider molecules that may not yet have been isolated in a laboratory, and under conditions that may not be easily attainable in a laboratory. It allows us to study molecules without fear of laboratory accidents and environmental hazards. The enormous advances made recently in computer technology allows, in some cases, computer modelling to be carried out more cheaply than analogous experimental work. Most importantly, it helps us understand the behavior and properties of molecules. Of course, there are limitations to theoretical work. The accuracy of theoretical predictions is limited by the quality of the models it is based upon. Thus this sort of work depends on a feedback loop involving cross-checking against experiment and subsequent refinement or redesign of the models or experiments.



Understanding the behavior of the electrons is crucial to predicting molecular properties and interactions. A conventional and heavily used approach is to focus on the electron density, which tells us where the electrons are likely to be. A complementary, and much less used, viewpoint is to ask what speed (momentum) the electrons are likely to have. We will investigate promising methods for forming quantitative links between electron momentum distributions and molecular properties such as polarizabilities and heats of formation. Success in this endeavour would represent a breakthrough in that a view of molecular structure complementary to that provided by the electron density would become available for all materials scientists.

"In the current era of ever depleting oil and natural gas reserves, concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and increasing attention to air quality, there is an urgent need to develop new means of storing and delivering energy. Fuel cells can meet this demand by efficiently and cleanly converting fuels to electricity, while batteries and hydrogen gas storage devices can store energy for transportation applications. These new technologies, however, still require further development because their capacity to store energy is still too small, their cost too high, and in the case of fuel cells, their durability still requires improvement.  In order to deal with materials issues that directly impact on commercialization of these technologies, a world class facility has been established at the University of Calgary. As part of this facility, the Thangadurai, Birss, Shimizu, and Khan research groups have developed significant advances in the areas of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell, lithium ion batteries, hydrogen storage materials, and diffusion bonding techniques. Further advances require enhancing the performance of a vast array of structured catalysts, ceramics, metal-organic frameworks, and metals. This requires the rapid assessment of various combinations of catalyst, ceramic, metal, and organic components in order to achieve the best performance. An ideal instrument to serve these goals and allow optimization of materials synthesis and high temperature compatibility between components, as well as monitoring of their reactivity with a gas environment, is variable atmosphere thermogravimetric (TGA) / differential thermal (DTA) analysis. This technique detects minute changes in mass and heat as a function of temperature and gas atmosphere. While two of these instruments do exist here, one is 11 years old and on its last legs and the second is of use only for highly specialized experiments.  However, this substantially diminishes student training and the analyses done by others at a distance will not give the same quality of research.   Therefore, we are requesting a combined TGA/DTA which will directly complement the existing infrastructure within our energy delivery and storage materials fabrication/testing facility.

"Volatility parameter and forecasting volatility play an important role in option pricing applications in finance and economics. Professors Granger and Engle received the Nobel Prize in 2003 for their research on volatility modeling and forecasting. Black-Scholes option pricing formula depends on the volatility of the stock price process. My previous research on nonlinear time series modeling and inference, cited by Nobel Prize winner Professor Granger (2003), will be extended to study inference such as forecasting, estimation and smoothing of random coefficient nonlinear volatility models. Current and recent market prices convey information about the probability distributions that govern future prices.

Taylor (2005) applies methods supported by empirical research to show how daily and more frequent asset prices, and the prices of option contracts, can be used to construct and assess predictions about future prices, their volatility, and their probability distributions. In this proposed research, as an application, data driven methods will be developed to obtain improved estimate of volatility and will be used to obtain the estimated price of a call option. Fuzzy forecasts of volatility and fuzzy option pricing will also be studied in some detail. Recent results on forecasting, selected by Science Direct as one of the Top 25 Hottest articles, will be extended to recently proposed models in finance and in economics. Data driven methods will also be developed to check for the adequacy of volatility models by developing some statistical tests. The research will also provide highly qualified training for some undergraduate as well as graduate  students on financial volatility modeling.

"Baculoviruses are large DNA viruses that are specific for arthropods.  They have been developed as environmentally sustainable insect control agents, highly successful protein expression vectors and more recently as human gene therapy vectors.  They are also excellent model systems for the investigation of eukaryotic gene regulation and mechanisms of viral replication. Baculoviruses contain large genomes that code for many genes and a coordinated expression of the genome is needed to enable these viruses to infect and kill cells.  Correct expression of the viral genes requires the action of pivotal viral regulatory genes which are the primary coordinators of viral gene expression and are also required for viral DNA replication.  The primary objectives of this study are to understand how viral regulatory proteins work at the molecular level. Correct expression of regulatory proteins is essential to ensure a normal infection and their activities are directly related to viral virulence and host range.  This study is also investigating genes specifically required for production of the form of virus which causes spread of an infection from tissue to tissue in diseased insects. Very little is known about how baculoviruses get out of infected cells but we are characterizing at a molecular level viral proteins that may be involved interacting with the cellular structures to facilitate viral transmission.  The fundamental knowledge obtained form these studies on how viruses infect and kill cells can be applied to many areas of biology including human medicine.  In addition, these investigations could lead to improved environmentally sustainable insect control agents and potentially enhanced protein expression and gene therapy vectors.

"Traumatic wounds frequently afflict horses, with healing complicated by the development of ""proud flesh"" leading to extensive scar tissue when these wounds are located on the limb, whilst body wounds tend to repair uneventfully. Impaired healing on the limb poses considerable welfare implications and bears a significant financial impact on the equine industry via the number of horses retired from an athletic career because of extensive scars or persisting lameness. 

The long term goal of my research program is to clarify some of the basic mechanisms of pathological scarring in the horse. Based on new findings uncovered during my current NSERC Discovery Grant, I suggest that deficient oxygen levels in the wound's microenvironment may contribute to extensive scarring in the horse, as it appears to in man. This proposal aims to verify the inherent response to hypoxia of normal skin cells from the body and the limb; to measure the oxygenation status of wounds of the body, wounds of the limb and wounds having developed proud flesh; and finally, to test the effect of a therapy purported to block the detrimental response of cells to hypoxia. 

This work will not only help determine some of the mechanisms involved in equine proud flesh, but will also provide a valuable tool to study scarring. Furthermore, data obtained herein may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for controlling scarring in various organs, in both veterinary species and man.

"Humans undergo significant changes during the critical years of adolescence. Complex modifications occur in specific areas of the brain while important changes in physical appearance, behavior and cognition happen at the same time. One of the most compelling issues characterizing adolescence is the profound alterations that mark the way in which an individual navigates the social world. Whereas social functioning in adolescence has been well characterized at a behavioral level, much remains to be learned about what brain mechanism underlies these changes. 

Recent advances in social neuroscience suggest that a simulation process contributes to our ability to understand other minds. According to this view, the circuits that are activated during the obervation of actions, emotions and sensations share critical, common substrates with those that are involved in the execution and experiencing of the same actions, emotions and sensations. In this proposal, we wish to examine the functional properties of the motor resonance sytem in adolescents, characterize its development and relate its changing properties to behavioral and emotional outcomes. In addition, we plan to provide a thorough assessment of the neurophysiological properties of primary motor cortex maturation to better understand how basic modifications in corticospinal tract function impact motor resonance during adolescence.  

This five year research program will provide a first attempt at characterizing the sensorimotor correlates of social change occuring during adolescence. The expected data will bridge the gap that exists between children and adult data by addressing exciting hypotheses that have emerged in recent years in social neuroscience. The study of motor resonance mechanisms will undoubtedly provide significant insight into how the adolescent brain works and develops, in addition to shedding some light on the basic mechanisms of brain maturation at the sensorimotor cortex level.

"The formalization of the notion of computation represents one of the great intellectual achievements of the last century, and this advance is indissociable of the technological revolution that has so profoundly transformed our world.

A most useful approach to refine that notion is to classify computations according to the amount of resources that are required to produce their solutions (for example time and memory space).

"There is currently a worldwide effort for advances in micro and nanotechnologies because of their high potential for technological applications in fields ranging from microfluidics (for biology or biomedicine) to microstructures with unprecedented mechanical, thermal and electrical properties (for microelectronics and aerospace applications).  However, several significant scientific and technological challenges have to be overcome in order to connect the ""nanometer scale"" world and its amazing properties to the ""micro"" and ""macro"" scale worlds, which are closer to human needs and practical applications.  Several approaches have emerged for fabricating two- and three-dimensional (2D/3D) miniature devices but they have been confined to relatively thin device architectures (a few layers thick) and are limited by material constraints.  Here the proposed research program involves applied research of micro and nanotechnologies for the development of innovative mechanical systems for the aerospace, microelectronics and biomedical industries.  The candidate and his collaborators have already demonstrated the original microfabrication of several innovative microdevices such as a solid oxide fuel cell for clean electrical power generation and a biosensor for small bioparticle detection.  This five-year program consists of different projects involving the development and characterization of a novel freeform microfabrication technique and the manufacturing of advanced and nanocomposite materials.  The successful realization of these projects will enable the creation of complex 3D micro and potentially nano structures made of high-performance nanocomposite materials.  The applicant believes that these structures will serve as a technological platform for a multitude of applications such as the fabrication ultra-light and high-stiffness structures for the aerospace industry.

"Cells are surrounded by membranes - complex assemblies of lipids and proteins held together by lipids' natural tendency to form bilayers, only two molecules thick, in watery environments. Nearly all biological membranes exist in a liquid crystalline physical state, where membrane components can diffuse within their own layer but typically cannot spontaneously hop to the opposite layer. Membrane lipids have large structural variability and recent evidence suggests that many biological membranes contain domains, distinguishable by both composition and physical characteristics. These domains are often enriched in sphingolipids, which tend in isolation to have relatively high melting temperatures (think of lard compared with olive oil), and sterols such as cholesterol. Based on work with 'model', i.e. protein-free, membranes, such domains are postulated to have a different physical state (""phase""), where the lipids have a more 'orderly' liquid crystalline structure than the surrounding membrane. Long-lived phase coexistence within a membrane strongly influences membrane character: local membrane thickness, diffusion of lipids and proteins within the membrane, interactions between lipids and proteins, and membrane protein function/flexibility could all be affected in cell membranes. We are interested in mapping out the fundamental interactions between phospholipids, sterols and sphingolipids in model membranes, as many of these are poorly understood even though they form the backdrop for interactions among other cell membrane components. Deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful experimental approach to the study of phase coexistence in membranes: different phases result in clearly distinguishable spectra, and the quantity of labeled lipid in a particular phase can be measured unambiguously. Importantly, deuterium NMR does not rely on large unnatural probes to monitor membrane domains, as even small amounts of such probes can modify domain properties. Knowledge gained from the proposed research will aid cell biologists investigating phenomena related to membrane domains, e.g. programmed cell death, protein localization/signaling, neuronal maturation and bacterial/viral infection.

"Silicon is the mainstay of our electronics, computing and communications technologies, and until recently it was only available as a mixture of the three stable isotopes: 28^Si, 29^Si and 30^Si. It is also the prototypical and most perfect semiconductor material, and as a result much of semiconductor physics and spectroscopy was developed and perfected using Si. The unexpected discovery by our group that the already very narrow linewidths of many of the optical transitions associated with impurities in Si were in fact limited by inhomogeneous isotope broadening in ordinary 'natural' Si, and that these transitions were more than ten times sharper in highly enriched 28^Si, quickly led to a number of surprising discoveries and potential new applications. In particular, the discovery that the tiny hyperfine splitting resulting from the coupling of the nuclear and electronic spins of the 31^P donor could be well resolved in the donor bound exciton transition in 28^Si has led to a number of potential applications in single atom detection, quantum computing and quantum information systems.



Our research involves exciting Si with laser light and monitoring the luminescence which is given off.  The requested equipment is a new type of laser whose wavelength of 1030 nm is ideally matched to the requirement of exciting relatively thick samples of Si.  It is also extremely compact and efficient, using little electrical power and requiring only ambient air cooling.

"Silicon holds a central role in the continuously advancing electronic device technology, which enables the computing, communications, entertainment and other technologies upon whcih we rely.  Silicon also holds a special place among semiconductors for the study of the physics of impurities, defects and excitations called excitons, thanks to the incredible purity and crystalline perfection available in silicon, resulting from the billions of dollars which have been invested in silicon technology over the past several decades.



We study an even more perfect form of silicon, known as isotopically enriched silicon, and we have discovered surprising and unexpected new properties of this material which have already lead to new discoveries in semiconductor physics, and which may in future lead to new applications in quantum computing.  Silicon, like most materials, has more than one stable isotope (different isotopes of the same element have the same chemical propoerties but differ slightly in mass since they contain different numbers of neutrons).  By eliminating the randomness inherent in this mixture of isotopes, some of the properties of isotopically enriched silicon are remarkably better than what was thought possible based on normal silicon.



In particular, this improves the optical properties which we study, and we can now observe phenomena which were thought to be impossible to see in any semiconductor, based on the properties of ordinary silicon.  For example, we can measure and control the tiny nuclear spins of impurity atoms in isotopically enriched silicon using optical means, and this leads to many exciting new applications in the promising field of quantum computing.  We can also study known, technologically important defects with incrediable new precision, and this has already led to a number of major surprises regarding the constituents of what were thought to be well-understood defects.

"The world is starting to witness a significant shift in the production of chemicals using new ""biorefinery""

technologies. Indeed, biorefinery will contribute to the integration of food into industrial processing. For

instance, cereals can be used to produce food, whereas crop residues, fibrous byproducts, and other cellulosic

materials can serve for industrial power, biochemicals, and fuels. It is only through these integrated processing

plants that the biobased industrial sector will expand without increasing the cost of food either diverting

agricultural production from its primary goal. One such product is bioethanol, which is a renewable and

sustainable energy source that can significantly reduce pollution. We propose to investigate various ways of

significantly reducing the production cost of bioethanol produced mainly from cellulosic materials.

A major portion of the cost to produce bioethanol is due to the high energy requirement for separating ethanol

from the fermentation broth. This problem is compounded by the fact that the final ethanol concentration is

commonly very low. In this research project, it is proposed to investigate various fermentation and hybrid

separation (adsorption, membrane, dephlegmator) strategies in order to address the difficulties of low ethanol

concentrations. State-of-the-art process synthesis, integration, and optimization will be used to devise the best

possible ethanol production flow sheets. Numerous scenarios will be assessed completely from both a

technological and economic point of view.

The four applicants have a wide range of expertise necessary to complete this project: fermentation, adsorption

and membrane separations, and optimization. A total of four graduate students and three undergraduate

students will take part in this project and will be exposed to the various facets of an ethanol production plant.","Enhancement of bioethanol production through process synthesis, integration, and optimization","Alternative energy resources",CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical engineering"

"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) regroups disorders such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and its incidence as leading cause of death among Canadians, is taking alarming proportion. This disease is characterized by impaired lung function, inflammation and scarring of bronchial tubes, and degradation of elastin-containing tissues. To date, only a few COPD biomarkers are currently used despite their increasing needs as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of disease progression. The objectives of this project are to develop new and highly sensitive methods enabling the quantitation of known elastin degradation products in urine and the identification of novel biomarkers correlated with COPD. Nano-scale liquid chromatography interfaced to either a Q-Trap or a high performance Orbitrap mass spectrometer will be used to obtain comprehensive ion profiles and targeted identification of urinary metabolites from a representative set of healthy and COPD patient samples. Comprehensive data mining and clustering analyses will be performed using in-house programs to profile the abundance of molecular species across sample types and replicates.

"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins play an intrinsic role in modulating numerous cellular activities including protein translocation, turnover, and interaction with binding partners. In human cells, the covalent attachment of more than 200 types of PTMs is carried out by dedicated enzymes representing about 5 % of the genome. Several of them including kinases, ubiquitin- and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) enzymes are misregulated in cancer cells, thus representing putative targets for drug discovery and cancer research programs. The functional correlation of these enzymes with phenotypic changes associated with tumorigenesis requires comprehensive profiling of PTMs at the genomic-scale, a daunting task given their diversity, stoichiometry and low distribution frequency within protein structures and cell extracts. In this context, mass spectrometry (MS) has proven to be an essential analytical tool providing sensitive and specific identification of PTMs from complex cell extracts. Our research program ""Chemi-enzymatic and data mining approaches for the identification of PTMs"" builds upon recent advances from our group in large-scale quantitative MS-based proteomics to profile protein modifications from affinity-enriched biological extracts. As part of this proposal, we will develop specific enrichment and digestion strategies together with targeted MS detection approaches for the identification of protein phosphorylation and sumoylation; two modifications of significant interest in cell signaling and cancer research. The tools developed will be applied in the study of cancer cell model systems to identify novel substrates and to unravel networks of interacting proteins modulated by chemical stimulants, kinase inhibitors and known chromosomal translocations associated with leukemia. More importantly, analytical tools developed in this proposal will be of broader application to any large-scale proteomics and drug discovery programs investigating protein-drug interactions and cell signaling events for the development of better targeted medicines ultimately improving human health.","Chemi-enzymatic and data mining approaches for the identification of post-translational modifications","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Bioanalytical chemistry"

"Efficient compartmentalization of structural proteins, receptors or enzymes is needed to ensure cellular integrity. 

Proteins bear signals that allow them to move to the proper location inside the cell. We are interested in the function of a signal mediating the retention of proteins in a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. More specifically, we are addressing the function of such a motif in a protein called the invariant chain, which is involved in the immune response to pathogens and tumours. Clarifying the mode of action of the sorting signal will help understanding its regulation in proteins in general but might also highlight the basis for  defects in the immune system.This is especially interesting in pathologies such as diabetes and some leukemias where the invariant chain expression is aberrant. 

We propose to characterize the role of molecules that interact with the invariant chain and affect its sub-cellular localization.

This project will have a major impact on our understanding of the mechanisms regulating intracellular sorting of proteins and assembly of multimeric complexes or receptors. In addition, our results should deepen the characterization of the ubiquitous 14-3-3 proteins. Finally, we will gather valuable structural information on the assembly and maturation of invariant chain. This should help in the development of vaccines or new therapeutic avenues in transplantation and autoimmunity.

"Climate change is fundamentally altering arctic ecosystems. Warming temperatures are changing the distribution of species while sea ice habitat is being transformed in ways that are irreversible under current climatic conditions. In terrestrial and marine environments, ecological shifts initiated near the base of the food web may be difficult to detect, especially in the early stages. However, such changes may have pronounced effects on the diets of top (apex) predators. The long-term objective of this research is to identify the natural and anthropogenic factors that influence predator foraging over multiple temporal and spatial scales. Dietary data will reflect individual- to population-scale responses in marine and terrestrial environments and will have important theoretical and applied implications; data will reveal the ecological impacts of climate change and guide the development of appropriate management and conservation strategies.  In the short-term, this research will produce improved and innovative methods for studying the foraging habits of free-ranging predators. I will examine the feeding ecology of polar bears (Ursus maritimus), grizzly bears (U. arctos), wolves (Canis lupus), and wolverines (Gulo gulo) using a combination of fatty acid profiles and stable isotope analyses. These techniques are based on the biochemical incorporation of dietary components and their results reflect integrated diet composition over a span of weeks to months. Combining these techniques with data on body condition, reproduction, and animal movement will allow innovation in 4 core areas: 1) Identification of novel biomarkers that can be used to study predator diets; 2) Examination of the nutritional physiology of large carnivores using captive and free-ranging animals; 3) Testing the hypothesis that habitat conditions and ecosystem productivity influence the foraging behaviour of top predators; and 4) Quantifying the relationship between sea ice changes and the energetic intake of polar bears via changes in prey availability. These investigations will support the training of numerous highly qualified personnel and provide a quantitative framework of data for assessing future changes in arctic ecosystems.

"In the last NSERC funding reallocations exercise, the submission on electrical and computer engineering highlighted the fact that, of the 8.3 billion CPUs produced in 2000, 80% found their way into embedded systems, 6% into robots and 12% into automobiles.  It asked how myriad intelligent appliances would be interconnected, how they would communicate, and what kind of management structures they would use, and stressed that these design challenges required new insights of a conceptual (as opposed to purely technological) nature, pointing to a coming sea change ""where the emphasis shifts from information and communication technologies to information and communication per se.''  



Telephone call processing illustrates some of the problems.  Services such as call forwarding, call waiting, and the hundreds of others that support communication over digital networks, are (of necessity) developed independently, as separate functional modules, by a variety of different vendors, and may be implemented on different platforms at various points in a network.  After the expense of their development and implementation, they are often found to interact with one another in unforeseen and undesirable fashion.  This so-called ""feature interaction problem'' was brought to the attention of researchers by the telecommunications industry, and remains both a costly practical problem and an active topic of research. 

 

The research proposed here will contribute systematic means of analyzing and designing complex, distributed systems, allowing the early detection and resolution of problems like feature interaction.  Independent of application domain or technology, the results will be formulated in terms of high-level ''discrete-event'' system models.   Students and postdoctoral fellows who have been involved with this research and related projects have gone on to work in industrial automation, in software engineering, and in further academic research.

"Every time a horse's hoof hits the ground it experiences shock from the impact then force as the weight of the body is borne by the leg. The impact distributes energy to hoof wall and the soft-tissues and bones it contains, and the force induces stress and strain in them.  Different regions and tissues of the hoof experience varying amounts of stress and strain, and the distribution of energy, stress and strain in a single footfall is called the mechanical behaviour of the hoof.  The hoof is like also bone and muscle in that it can respond over time to changes in the amount of impact and force it experiences per day.  

This proposal is to support several experiments each exploring a different possible way that the hoof might respond to changes in impact and force over time.  The first is to test how the laminar junction - the strong layer supporting the hoof wall on the bone inside it - remodels under varying stresses and strains.  We'll use computer modelling of real hooves to calculate the stress and strain in the laminar junction of each, then compare the stress patterns with patterns in the structure of the laminar junction.   The laminar junction also absorbs much of the energy of impact.  So the second test is to compare the laminar junction's  ability to absorb impact among hooves that have worked on surfaces that change the amount of energy needing to be absorbed.   The final test is to culture cells that form the hoof as they grow to examine their responses to varying levels of stress, by determining the effects on their rates of growth, and expression of certain genes. 

This work will lead to an understanding of how the hoof has adapted its 'fingernail' to become part of the weightbearing musculoskeletal system - this is a question of general interest to biologists.  It will also help ascertain how the hooves of individual horses adapt to changes in loadbearing requirements during their lifetimes - this is of biological interest, and also has implications for hoof care and the prevention of lameness in riding horses.","The response of some mammalian supporting tissues and structures to mechanical loading","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,Biomechanics
"Human beings have long been occupied with the question of how planetary systems form and evolve.  The answer is central to placing ourselves in context within the Universe, to the search for other habitable worlds, and ultimately, to the search for other life.  Though more than 250 planets have been detected around other stars over the past decade, our knowledge of how both they and our own Solar System came to be is still very incomplete.  Using a new hybrid computer code developed by the principal investigator, it is for the first time possible to perform an end-to-end simulation of the entire formation process---in essence, of how a disk around a young star converts itself into planets.  This code combines the speed of an ``N-body"" scheme optimized for planetary systems (based on the existing SyMBA package) with a one-dimensional implementation of a protostellar disk (which represents the disk as made up of nested rings).  These two parts are coupled using standard prescriptions for (i) the dynamical interaction of a planet with a disk, and (ii) the rate at which a planet grows its atmosphere by gravitationally pulling in gas from the disk.  With this computer code as the primary tool, the research proposed here is aimed at advancing our understanding of planet formation.  A series of key additions and enhancements will be made to the code over time, each allowing a new aspect of the planet formation process to be studied.  At the same time, the high speed of the code---several days to simulate the several-million-year lifespan of a protostellar gas disk---will be maintained.  It is intended that three summer students, three graduate students and one postdoctoral researcher will be trained/employed over the course of the project.  At the end of the funding period, the finished, fully documented and rigorously tested code will be made freely available to the public.

"Enormous quantities of machine-readable data, measured in terabytes, are readily available. The sources include the World-Wide Web, publicly available databases, XML document repositories, experimental data, genomic annotations, and so on. However, data does not necessarily equal useful information. More often than not, the data has to be intelligently processed, validated, transformed, and then integrated into unified repositories. Also, users of advanced data-intensive applications need efficient and flexible query and search systems in order to derive critical information. 

In this research, we will work towards finding better solutions for some of the important problems related to information integration, validation and exchange of data, flexible querying and search, and information retrieval. Specifically, we will focus on developing efficient view-based solutions for the integration of semistructured data, investigating new automata-based techniques for XML data exchange and integration, and introducing and studying preference frameworks for XML Information Retrieval.

Another topic of our research will be the flexible and efficient processing of large amounts of genomic data. We will focus on developing new structures and algorithms, which will help building of large-scale bioinformatics applications with the ability to smoothly adapt to memory hierarchies.

"Funds are requested to acquire an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source to fit into an existing Bruker MicroTOF (time-of-flight) mass spectrometer that is capable of acquiring high resolution data. In 2006 the Dalhousie University Department of Chemistry Mass Spectrometry Facility was granted NSERC funds with which to purchase a MicroTOF mass spectrometer and it is for this instrument that an APCI source is being sought: this acquisition would make this NSERC-funded instrument extremely versatile and even better value. 



Mass spectrometry provides scientists with information regarding the molecular mass of molecules. High resolution mass spectrometry can help scientists to decipher the likely molecular formula of molecules, and this is of significant assistance when characterizing molecules that are new. APCI mass spectrometry is particularly useful for the analysis of molecules that do not protonate easily and for which alternative modes of ionization are unsuccessful. Many of the molecules analyzed in the Dalhousie University Department of Chemistry Mass Spectrometry Facility are non-polar and thus unsuitable for investigation via electrospray ionization (ESI) whereby protonation (or ""sodiation"") is a pivotal requirement. Presently, the MicroTOF mass spectrometer can only give high resolution mass spectral information when operating under ESI mode, and this is a clear limiting factor: provision of the requested APCI source would significantly enhance the quality and quantity of research stemming from synthetic and analytical chemistry projects. 



The APCI source would be used by around twenty research groups at Dalhousie University, plus others from other Maritime universities and beyond (e.g., regular users of services from Acadia University, St. Francis Xavier University, University of New Brunswick, University of Mannitoba).

"This proposal details the design, synthesis, characterization and application of homochiral dipyrromethene helicates, ideal candidates for use in applications that exploit optical and coordinative phenomena, e.g. chiral polymers, chiroptical switches, responsive surfactants, and catalysts. Dipyrromethenes have traditionally been synthetic precursors to porphyrins, although some chelation studies have been reported. With work in the Thompson group and elsewhere (primarily Germany, Japan, and the USA), the dipyrromethene moiety is emerging as an intriguing conjugated ligand skeleton that gives complexes possessing unique physicochemical properties. Researchers in the Thompson group are world leaders in the diastereoselective synthesis of dipyrromethene-based helicates, and are well-placed to harness the potential of such complexes through the exploitation of optical and physical characteristics (e.g. circular dichroism, UV-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, solution- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, HPLC, X-ray structure), as well as reactivity (e.g. coordination, self-assembly). Securing a fundamental understanding of the structure and properties of dipyrromethene helicates is crucial to all aspects of this research programme.



The expertise of the Thompson laboratory lies in the synthesis and characterization of heterocycles. Synthetic chemistry involving dipyrromethenes is often very challenging, as the pyrrolic unit is highly reactive and can be difficult to handle during the preparation of complex molecules. Researchers trained in the Thompson group develop excellent synthetic chemistry skills. Careful and skilled mentoring ensures that current/future goals and expectations are met, that interest and motivation remains high, and that students strive to achieve their best at all times.

"My research deals with medical instruments which make images of ""function"" rather than ""anatomy"". The weather map in the morning paper is an example of a ""functional image"" of Canada. It tells you that there is a storm expected in Ottawa later today, but not the best highway you would use to get from Montreal to Ottawa. A road map shows anatomy, an weather map shows function.

   Functional images of living creatures have less detail than anatomical images. If the brain of a rat (which was sacrificed while its wiskers were being stroked, and had previously been injected with radioactive glucose), is sliced up we can put the slices on a film and the image shows very fine details of which parts of the brain were active. But in an awake animal or for human imaging such detail is presently not possible since the imaging must be done by external detectors, not by direct contact.

   Positron emission tomography, or PET, gives clinicians and researchers the best quality functional images of patients and animals which can be presently obtained. The goal of my research is to improve both the spatial  and temporal resolution of PET imaging. Just as you would like to know from a weather map if the thunder storm was going to occur over the base-ball stadium or on the other side of town(spatial resolution) and either during or after the ball game (temporal resolution), my research is aimed at providing significant improvments in functional medical imaging.

    Recently PET, especially when combined with the anatomical imaging technique called CT scanning, has been demonstrated has having the best ability to diagnose and stage many cancers. However, it is also the most expensive technique, and PET scans take much longer to perform. One of the projects I have worked on very successfully, and want to continue, is one which will make PET scans both faster and more accurate without adding cost to the scanner. This will allow more patients to be scanned per day, reducing wait-times and cost to the health care system.

"The research described in this proposal is devoted to understanding the energetics of molecules following light excitation as well as elucidation and characterization of the pathways electronically excited molecules access to dissipate the energy and return to their lowest energy state.  The excited state chemistry of chromophoric molecules in plants and photosynthetic bacteria drive photosynthesis, a process which is essential to life on earth.   

     The systematic investigation of the properties of molecular excited states that will accrue from our group's and other research groups around the world will yield a knowledge base that will be used to rationally control and predict the excited state properties in molecular systems. Ultimately, this research should teach us how to engineer molecules and their associated excited states to affect important energy transformations where photonic energy is converted to chemical energy such as fuels.  As our fossil fuels supplies become more finite, it is critical that energy conversion from others sources such as solar energy be explored and developed.

     The investigations described in this proposal are directly relevant to photosynthesis and the microscopic chemical processes employed in the photosynthetic apparatus to convert light energy into high energy molecules, for example sugars and ATP.  The proposed investigations are designed to create a systematic knowledge base and ultimately the use of this knowledge in the creation of technology to allow the rational engineering of photonic devices for energy conversion.

"A fundamental goal of behavioural genetics is to understand how complex social behaviour evolves. From humans to social insects to mole rats, social animals fascinate us, probably because it is so remarkable that evolution has, in these few cases, favored cooperation and altruism over conflict and selfishness. We know from the theory of social evolution that these seemingly non-Darwinian traits can evolve via a type of kin-mediated natural selection, known as 'kin selection', provided the trait has a genetic basis. Aspects of social behaviour are certainly evolved, but we do not yet know which genes are under selection, or how these genes interact with each other and their environment to influence the social phenotype. Moreover, sociality will, in turn, influence the expression and transmission of genes, but it is not always clear how. What is clear is that to fully understand the evolution of social traits, we need to think in molecular terms.

 

The aim of my research is to drive the discipline of behavioural genetics forward to explore the new domain of 'sociogenomics' - the molecular basis of social behaviour. To do this, I use two species of highly social insects for which state-of-the-art technologies can be applied to measure what effect, if any, genes have on their behaviour. A leading hypothesis is that social integration is evolutionarily driven by an ability to recognize and preferentially direct altruism toward close kin, thereby propagating 'genes for altruism' down genealogical lines. I use a species of termite to test this idea by quantifying how kinship influences inter-individual recognition in natural populations. A related hypothesis is that the expression of altruism should depend on social circumstance, not just relatedness. I use the honey bee to examine how gene expression mediates altruism under experimentally manipulated hive conditions. My objective is to assess the genetic, and thus environmental, effect on social traits, and to characterise the genes that underlie variation in these traits.

"The long-term objective of this research is to gain an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant senescence as well as the transition from growth to senescence as plants develop. 

    EXECUTION OF SENESCENCE. We have shown that membrane lipid phase separations induced by fatty acid de-esterification are early and seminal events in the senescence cascade, leading to membrane leakiness and loss of ion and metabolite gradients essential for normal cell function.  We have also established that dismantling of senescing membranes is highly regulated. In the case of the plasma membrane, for example, domains enriched in lipid and protein catabolites are progressively voided from specific regions of the membrane because of packing imperfections at their boundaries. This allows the remaining membrane to continue to function as senescence progresses. We are currently characterizing senescence-induced genes responsible for changes in the molecular organization of membranes that underpin this regulated, progressive dismantling of their structure.

    REGULATION OF THE TRANSITION FROM GROWTH TO SENESCENCE. We have identified a protein (eIF5A) that appears to play a key role in regulating cell survival and cell death in both the plant and animal kingdoms.  eIF5A is post-translationally modified to hypusine-eIF5A, and its  ability to regulate both cell survival (leading to growth) and cell death (leading to senescence) appears to be determined by its state of post-translational modification.  We have obtained evidence by modulating both the expression of eIF5A and its state of post-translational modification in transgenic plants that unmodified eIF5A promotes growth, whereas hypusine-eIF5A is required for senescence. We are currently determining how the transition from unmodified eIF5A to hypusine-eIF5A is regulated, and whether the various isoforms of plant eIF5A have specific roles in growth and senescence.

"Our scientific goal is to improve our understanding of the processes that control predictability of the atmoshere, the ocean and the shelf seas that border them. On a more practical note, we want to make more accurate predictions. The funding will support two graduate students to work on the following research topics. 



1. Global Atmosphere-Ocean Assimilation and Prediction: The most effective way of predicting future states of the ocean and atmosphere is based on assimilating observations into dynamic models. Without assimilation the models quickly drift away from reality. We will focus on the assimilation of new types of ocean data (e.g. sea levels measured by satellites, vertical profiles of temperature and salinity from freely-drifting floats) into coupled atmosphere-ocean models. New assimilation methods will be devised that allow observations from one fluid (e.g. upper ocean temperatures) to influence both fluids in a dynamically-consistent way. The research should lead to better forecasts of the coupled system on time scales of days to seasons, and a deeper understanding of the physical processes that control predictability, both globally and regionally.



2. Predictability of the Coastal Ocean: Storms surges along the coast of Atlantic Canada can be forecast two-days into the future to within about 10 cm.  More research is needed to make accurate forecasts of currents, temperature and salinity. We will improve the Dalhousie coastal ocean forecast system by coupling it to an eddy-resolving model of the adjacent North Atlantic. This will allow changes in deep ocean ""weather"" to influence coastal circulation. The research should improve short-term forecasts of currents and water properties of the shelf seas of Atlantic Canada, and deepen our understanding of the physical causes of the dramatic changes (about 3C) in sea surface temperature that have occurred in this region over the last 50 years.

"Self-assembly methods with 'pre-programmed' ligands (molecules capable of binding metal ions to form a larger metal containing aggregate) are used to produce specific transition metal cluster and grid arrays with the metal ions bridged in close proximity by small atomic entities, which allow electronic communication between the metal centres. This leads to novel electrochemical and magnetic properties, which are being examined in the context of using these nano-meter scale, 'quantum dot' like arrays as devices for information storage and processing at the molecular level. The application of such systems to surfaces (e.g. gold, graphite) in ordered arrangements and monolayers, and the ability to probe individual molecules, and metal atoms, using scanning tunneling techniques (e.g. STM - scanning tunneling microscopy, STS - scanning tunneling spectroscopy and CITS - current induced tunneling spectroscopy), has paved the way for individual molecular switching using external electronic and magnetic probes, and the possible storage of information at both the molecular and surface array level.    )	Current [nxn] grids include [2x2], [3x3] and [4x4] systems, thus creating nanometer (2-3 x 2-3 nm) scale molecules with very high metal and unpaired electron densities. Metals examined include Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn. Attempts are underway to increase grid dimensions further with appropriate ligand design.

    )	This research area is highly topical in the world community, and we have a distinct advantage using the self-assembly approach with pre-designed ligands, in the sense that most research groups rely on serendipitous self-assembly methods, with smaller, simpler ligands, where outcomes are in large measure unpredictable. Our research has shown the beauty of predictable molecular construction, and provides the inorganic chemistry community with new methodologies for the construction of large polymetallic assemblies, and the 'high tech' electronics sector with nanometer scale subunits with the potential for molecular device behaviour

The  research proposal concerns the statistical modelling  of association and dependence among observations in time or space, with particular emphasis on survey data and survey methodology.  I am  proposing work  on three aspects of the analysis of complex survey data. The first topic is that of density estimation for the joint distribution of event times  and for spatial analysis; the former is relevant when we are interested in assessing whether one type of event might trigger another, and the latter will be applicable to the visualization of spatial distributions of  disease incidence.  The second topic  is estimation in multilevel models, wherein explanatory variables at more than one level of aggregation are used to model responses; since this kind of modeling is increasingly widely used, resampling methods which allow for the complex sampling design in estimating components of variance, and which can be made available to analysts,  will be explored.    Finally, I will study applications of hierarchical models to account for population heterogeneity in the analysis of survey data, with particular application to cross-cultural survey methods.  This topic is of great interest to social scientists and health scientists in the context of international surveys.

"The recent trend toward electricity market deregulation that has occurred in jurisdictions around the world has led to a fundamental shift in the role of individual power producers.  In this new paradigm, individual market participants must bear the sole financial risks of market price and cost uncertainties.  In addition, innovations in financial energy contracts are rapidly becoming more popular as a means of managing risk.  No longer can operational decisions be separated from financial market realities.  Similarly however, the operational constraints of electrical generators do not disappear when markets are deregulated.  The operational restrictions of electrical power plants often force companies to continuously make decisions that will have highly uncertain future financial consequences.  One simple example would be a hydro plant with a limited reserve of water or a coal plant with a limited inventory of coal that must decide at what price to produce power given that whatever resources are consumed today will no longer be available in the future.   Determining the size of this opportunity cost is complicated by the high degree of uncertainty in power prices as well as the number of different factors which may influence these prices.  As coal inventory decisions in Ontario alone can involve hundreds of millions of dollars, this problem is far from trivial.  Dozens of other operational constraints give rise to similar such decision making problems in the face of uncertainty.  For individual participants to operate and manage risk efficiently, powerful computer models and mathematical solution algorithms are required.  Currently however, most such financially based methods are limited in the number of variables they can consider.  This proposal aims at developing a new set of mathematical algorithms that will enable industry practitioners to take into account more factors and variables than is currently computationally feasible, thereby leading to a more efficient use of the nation's scarce energy resources.

"The area of science termed ""systems biology"" has expanded tremendously in very recent times. Implicit in this field is recognition that it is necesary to study the biological cell and/or collections of cells as a functioning unit, rather than use the more conventional segmented approach. This relatively new direction offers unique opportunties with respect to the understanding of biological phenomena, particularly as it pertains to the study of diseases, and the construction of artificial devices that have biology as a model for operation. In this project it is proposed to investigate two aspects of systems-like forms - the behaviour of isolated collections of neurons and neuron-like devices. With respect to the former we intend to study cultures of neurons placed on surface substrates by several unique intruments available in our laboratory. Important questions that remain unanswered to date relate to the best surface environment for cell growth and how such cells communicate with each other. We plan to investigate the mechanisms of inter-cellular communication and how these processes are affected by experimental drugs used for the treatment of neural diseases. In a second related project we will reserch a completely new approach to neural-like structures. This will be based on the non-linear processes that occur when electrochemical elctrodes are subject to dissolution. We have discoverd recently that when information is fed to such a system, it can be employed successfully to identify pattens, in much the same way that is evident in the natural brain. The practical implication of this research is that a totally new approach to artificial cognition will be possible. Such cognition is crucial in many areas of engineering and medicine.

"The flow of granular materials in engineering processes is poorly understood owing to its complex dynamics.  Composed of discrete particles that are encompassed by fluid (i.e. liquid or gas), granular matter often displays movement profoundly different from solids, liquids, or gases [Mueth et al., Nature 2000; 406: 385-389].  The limited knowledge regarding granular flow is considered problematic by engineers and scientists due to the extensive presence of these materials in modern processes.  Extrusion is an example of a processing technology often involving granular flow, which serves a wide range of industries, such as the food, metal, polymer, and pharmaceutical sectors; industries which heavily contribute to the economy of Canada.  It is crucial to develop accurate engineering tools to design, operate, and troubleshoot extrusion processes and yet available extruder models overlook the complexity of granular mechanics in their theories. Neglect or over-simplifying the dynamic nature of these materials in almost all cases, severely restricts the application of these models.  As a result, extrusion manufacturers rarely rely on the available engineering tools, instead being reliant on the experience of their process engineers - a scenario that can become quite costly as global competition drives companies to pursue emerging technologies.  Clearly, new theories and models for extrusion are necessary that properly describe the complexity of granular materials present in a system.

   

The proposed research is novel in its focus on the dynamics of granular matter within extruders.  This work, which involves both experimental and computational studies, is a continuation of on-going research to improve the fundamental understanding of granular mechanics in extrusion.  The goal of this research is to produce improved theories and scaling tools related to extrusion that will be developed by discrete modeling methods and validated by experimental findings.  Principally, the industries targeted in the immediate work are the polymer, food and pharmaceutical sectors - all having significant impact on Canadians.","Advanced extrusion concepts-processing of granular matter","Manufacturing processes and products",CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical engineering"
"The goal of this research is to study feeding, digestion and nutrition in a clam, Yoldia hyperborea, which lives in fine mud in coastal waters of Newfoundland at temperatures permanently below 0ï¿½C.  The clam depends heavily on organic matter from the spring diatom bloom, which sinks to the bottom.  A major objective is to determine how the clam responds to an intermittent food supply.  Invertebrate animals that live in bottom sediments on the continental shelf in cold oceans play an important role in the ecology of the system, and represent a significant amount of the carbon tied up in the benthic community, yet their biology is not well understood.  The close proximity of water that is below 0ï¿½C year-round provides a natural laboratory for studying cold-water ecology and ecophysiology and also permits frequent sampling.  The work will also focus on the accumulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids by the clam, which are important in maintaining the integrity of biological membranes.","Role of benthic marine invertebrates in carbon flow","Oceans, seas and estuaries",CANADA,CANADA,"Biological oceanography"
"The study of the cardiac mechanics and blood flow is challenging from an engineering perspective due to the complexity of normal heart function and the difficulty in acquiring high quality in-vivo data that is sufficient for realistic descriptions of function. Not surprisingly there remain fundamental aspects of how our heart works that are not described. Of particular interest in the proposed program is the importance of ""waves"" in heart function, both mechanical waves in the heart muscle and pressure waves that travel in the blood.  Waves are commonly observed in the blood vessels, giving rise to the pulse commonly measured at ones wrist, for example, but the manifestation of waves in the heart is not well understood.  We propose that fundamental aspects of heart function itself cannot be accurately described without a wave description, which would represent a shift in the current biomechanical descriptions of the heart.  High temporal and high spatial resolution imaging data (from magnetic resonance imaging) will be acquired and processed to evaluate the patterns of muscle strain over time and space in the heart that are necessary to study the propagation of waves within the muscle.  Similar measurements within the blood pool in the heart will be used to show how wave-like motion of the heart gives rise to comparable wave patterns in the blood which ultimately drive the blood flow that our bodies depend upon.  The long term goals of this work are to develop tools to study heart and blood motion and to describe the realistic mechanical and fluid dynamics of the working heart, which ultimately are necessary to understand both normal function and abnormal function in the many diseases of the heart.","Measurement of tissue and hemodynamic wave phenomena in cardiac function","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,Biomechanics
"The techniques of ion trapping use electric and/or magnetic fields to trap or suspend charged particles, such as ionized atoms or molecules, within ultralow pressure vacuum chambers.  This combination allows us to all but fully isolate our experimental environment from the lab surrounding it.  There are many benefits to such isolation, specifically it allows us to control the conditions within our experimental environment, such as creating ultracold (temperature << 1 K) or very hot conditions for our atomic and/or molecular samples.  Alternatively, one can take advantage of this extreme isolation to study species that cannot survive or are more difficult to study in a more conventional environment, such as molecular radicals, unstable atomic isotopes, and even anti-matter. 

     This particular research program combines computational and experimental techniques to investigate the range of applicability of ion traps for the study of interesting physical systems.  Control of the experimental environment is investigated through the study of sympathetic temperature control of ionic species, a technique whereby mixtures of ions are stored in a single trap in highly interacting states such that by controlling the temperature of one species, for example by employing laser cooling techniques, the temperature of the other trapped species can be influenced.  With respect to trapping and study of exotic species, one component of this proposal investigates a range of stable and unstable isotopic species by using the TITAN system (Triumf Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science) at the TRIUMF National Laboratory, while a second component, the Antihydrogen Laser PHysics Apparatus (ALPHA) uses traps to store and manipulate antiprotons and positrons in an effort to produce store and study the most fundamental of antimatter atoms, antihydrogen, with a goal of testing some of the most fundamental theories in physics.

"Research is being conducted into structures that form from ""soft"" materials on nanometre length scales. Some soft materials that are being studied include polymers (long chain molecules), block copolymers (polymers linked together at their ends), colloids (micro- or nanometre sized particles found in suspensions), liquid crystals (micro- or nanometre sized objects that can form phases that have aspects of both a liquid and a crystal) or small amphiphilic molecules (for example, phospholipids, out of which cell walls are formed). Theoretical calculations are being carried out to predict which structures are the most stable so that these morphologies can be used in applications. For example, polymer foams (polymer materials with nanometre-sized bubbles in them) are being studied since they could have applications in consumer products, electronics and automotive parts, while at the same time being environmentally more benign than regular polymer materials. Block copolymers and small amphiphilic molecules can have applications as nanoporous materials or for drug delivery purposes; this results from their ability to ""self-assemble"", which means they can form nanoscale structures spontaneously. Block copolymers and colloids can be combined to form nanocomposites that are useful as photonic band gap materials (materials that let only certain types of light pass through) or as functionally graded materials (substances whose properties are different at different locations throughout a specimen).

"Do you go with your gut instinct, or weigh out all of the pro's and con's before you decide?   Although many of us might like to say that we weigh the alternatives, experimental evidence indicates otherwise.  Instead, scientists have identified a number of non-rational processes by which answers or choices quickly pop into mind; so long as these seem reasonable or plausible, they often become substitutes for rational analysis.  Researcher have used problems like the following to study this phenomenon:  



If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets? ______ minutes



A large majority of people answer this simple problem incorrectly, presumably because they do not take the time to work out the rate of production. Instead, they give the answer that first comes to mind (100). Why? I propose that this occurs because this answer is accompanied by a feeling of rightness, and this feeling is the signal that deeper analytic processing is not required.  In other words, it is the experience of producing the answer, rather than the answer per se that is the cue to engage or suppress analytic processing.



The goal of the proposed research is to investigate this feeling of rightness.  What is the relationship between the strength of this feeling and the inclination to rethink that first answer?  What are the properties of tasks, situations, and people that give rise to the feeling of rightness?  Under what circumstances might people be induced to ignore this feeling and think through the alternatives?  The answers to these questions will facilitate development of a comprehensive model of decision-making and choice.  In turn, this should lead to strategies and recommendations for how to improve reasoning and decision-making in a broad range of contexts.

"We propose to continue studying the connection between normal modes of the Sun (specific geometric configurations that oscillate at specific frequencies), propagation in space plasmas, and the effects of these modes on Earth. Our 1995 discovery of these modes has snowballed from a curiosity in scientific data, to dropped calls on cellular phone systems, and most recently, to their detection in atmospheric pressure and seismic data. This is gradually changing people's views of how propagation in space plasmas works and, with it, views of solar-terrestrial coupling. I anticipate that this will lead to eventual improvements in space weather forecasts with applications ranging from geological prospecting to air traffic control. 



A major task of the next few years will be to continue the basic scientific research, including refinements in our statistical characterization of the modes, their propagation properties, and more intensive study of the mechanisms that couple them into various terrestrial systems. For example, we know that these modes are responsible for a large fraction of the dropped calls in cellular phone systems, but do not know the atmospheric or ionospheric physics responsible. 



Simultaneously, I plan to continue refining the statistical and analytic tools that make such transformative research possible. The scientific and engineering discoveries have only been possible because of better data analysis methods, in particular the multitaper method of estimating spectra and coherences. 



The work of the last five years has resulted in favourable publicity for Canadian science from Science Magazine to the European Space Agency's website. Training another 40 or more students in these methods should help spread these methods into Canadian industry.

"Understanding and developing innovative contaminated site clean-up technologies are critical for the redevelopment of Brownfields since this will minimize consumption of greenfields sites and ensure sustainable development.  Despite over two decades of development of innovative remediation technologies, many contaminated sites, particularly those where non-aqueous phase liquids are present, have not been effectively treated.  In situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) has emerged as a remedial technology that can be used to aggressively treat contaminated sites in an effective and efficient manner.



The overall objective of this research proposal is to improve the level of understanding of the reactivity and transport of activated persulfate in subsurface systems.  A specific focus is on activated persulfate systems and the need to develop predictive tools for use by remediation scientists and engineers for design and screening.  A combination of bench-scale and pilot-scale experiments will be performed, supported by computational simulations and data analyses.  Fundamental aspects to be addressed include interactions between the subsurface environment and the injected persulfate solution, the fate and destruction ability of various activated persulfate formulations, alterations to the aquifer sorption proprieties following persulfate treatment, and alternative ways to deliver persulfate to treat dissolved phase plumes.



The proposed research represents an original effort that will lead to significant contributions to the current understanding of the reactivity and transport of activated persulfate in situ.  This knowledge will increase the level of confidence associated with persulfate based ISCO treatment and increase its acceptability as a viable and economical contaminated site clean-up technology.

"The Product Life Cycle Management environment is becoming more complex due to factors such as shared product development and globalization. Some of the issues are: a wide range of internal legacy systems, interoperability, a growing number of partners, suppliers and affiliates for development projects, a wide spectrum of technical and management skills among partners, increasing requirements with regard to security (military projects, export of control technology, industrial espionage), and protection of intellectual property (IP) in a multi-partner, multi-nation environment.  The project, Collaborative Development for Product Life Cycle Management, is focused on developing methods that will provide effective information sharing, adherence to security and IP regimes, and better management of corporate information.

The project will investigate present and potential collaborative environments, the spectrum of solutions presently being used, and potential solutions provided through technology and management practices. Research will be done on protocols for collaboration and information sharing, on technologies that are transportable across different systems and scalable across different capabilities, on models for development under different partnering situations, and on management techniques that foster effective collaboration.

"Research will be done on coordination techniques that improve new product development (NPD), especially where there are many partners. Partnering is increasing because of globalization and reduced cycle times, and new mechanisms are needed to improve coordination and thus productivity. The creation of information to move from incomplete to complete designs is the key NPD activity. Coordination is the use of processes and communication mechanisms, of information tools for capturing, moving and configuring information, and of an organizational structure to formalize the relationship of participants. 

     The research will study coordination theory, i.e., the fundamental attributes of coordination, coordination mechanisms in general and those appropriate for NPD. Coordination theory to date has only quantified coordination in terms of cost, i.e., the cost of the communication network + information exchange + network vulnerability.  The proposed research will develop techniques to measure the cost-benefit trade-off of different coordination mechanisms. This will be studied by taxonomy, by discrete event simulation (cost and time comparison of processes) and by the modelling of coordination mechanisms (process and mathematical models) in order to understand coordination performance and attributes. The attributes of interest are: information exchange, synchronization of activities, structure of resources, and support technologies. Company data will be used to build models and validate results. 

     The outcomes of the research will be quantified cost-benefit coordination models, demonstrated links between coordination attributes and reduced cycle times, and the best mechanisms to reduce NPD project span time and effort.

"    )	The focus of my research program continues to be on fungal diversity and the effects of disturbance on diversity and ecosystem function in fungi.  How many species of fungi are there?  Does disturbance influence fungal diversity or community composition?  Does fungal diversity matter - i.e., do disturbed sites have altered ecosystem function as a consequence of changes to the fungal community?  These are enormous and complex questions, any of which may require many lifetimes of study to reach a full answer.  Research from my lab and others around the world now conclusively support the idea that disturbance does influence fungal diversity, but our results reject my hypothesis from five years ago that greatest diversity should occur at sites of intermediate disturbance.  Instead, at least in agricultural soils, the richness and diversity of mushroom fungi (Basidiomycota) are greatest in sites of least disturbance, perhaps because the diversity of microhabitats or niches within soil increases with time since disturbance.  We plan to continue to explore the spatial and temporal aspects of fungal diversity in soil, and the links between fungal diversity and ecosystem function.  How many species of mushrooms can be found at scales of square centimeters or hectares?  One limitation to our progress in molecular exploration of diversity is the limited number of reference sequences of named species of fungi, especially in certain groups that we encounter frequently: the entolomatoid clade (Agaricales) and ""clavarioid fungi"" (Agaricales and cantharelloid clade).  We plan to target these fungi for collection and sequencing, so that we may add to the reference database of sequences available and better identify the environmental sequences obtained from soil community DNA.  These studies offer an opportunity to detect the effects of disturbance on communities of soil fungi and on the contribution to soil health that selected community members provide.  Our findings will have impact in the areas of sustainable agriculture, forestry, and biological conservation.

"Knee ligament injuries are common, in fact, 1 in 3000 people suffer an injury to their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) every year.  Ligaments are soft biological tissues that connect bones across a joint.  Knee ligaments guide joint motion and maintain joint stability by resisting forces that tend to separate the bones of the joint.  Some ligaments heal after injury by producing scar tissue that reconnects the torn ligament ends.  When ligaments are not able to heal and reconnect the torn ligament ends, surgery is required to reconstruct the injured ligament.  In some percentage of patients, injured and reconstructed ligaments do not maintain joint stability and appear to have ""stretched out"", leaving the patient susceptible to the development of painful osteoarthritis.  Unfortunately, the reasons for poor healing of ligaments remain unclear.  However, the current proposal questions whether the healing process is able to keep pace with the mechanical demands placed on the ligament.  If the mechanical demands exceed the healing potential, damage may accumulate in the ligament as it heals.  Normal daily loading for ligament involves sustained and repeated loading; the engineering terms for which are creep and fatigue, respectively.  Creep and fatigue loading can cause damage to accumulate in a healing ligament.  The exciting innovation of the proposed study is to apply the established engineering principles of continuum damage mechanics to a new problem from the field of biology and medicine, which is poor resolution of ligament healing.  Experimental mechanical tests and theoretical mathematical models will be applied to help engineers and orthopaedic surgeons alike understand how damage accumulates in healing ligaments.  The intended benefit of this research program is improved treatment of patients with knee ligament injuries.

"This research program investigates the role of spatial and temporal information in the organization of animal memory, using a paradigm known as time-place learning (TPL). In TPL the availability of food varies depending on the time (e.g., the time in minutes since the study session began or the time of day) and the place (e.g., location on a radial arm maze). There has been some debate about how animals store this information in memory. Gallistel (1990) proposes that animals encode this information into a tripartite code that contains the time, place and event. I have proposed an alternative hypothesis that says that animals encode the information into two bipartite codes - one containing time and event and the other place and event. The primary goal of my proposed program of research is to determine whether the bipartite or tripartite hypothesis is more likely to reflect how rats encode the spatiotemporal information. I will then confirm that the findings of that research is also applicable to other animals in TPL tasks. The ultimate goal is to determine if bipartite (or tripartite) encoding of spatiotemporal information can be used to explain memory outside the realm of TPL. It has been suggested that animals may encode all biologically important information in terms of their spatial and temporal characteristics (Gallistel, 1990). Recently Brown and McCormack (2006) published a chapter suggesting that human memory may be organized temporally (and possibly spatially), suggesting a natural fit with the proposed research.

"Fossil fuels can be supplemented as an energy currency by introducing hydrogen as the medium of energy transfer through generation, storage and conversion into electricity by utilization of electrolysers and fuel cells. This mode of generation can alleviate problems associated with GHG emission effects by the introduction of renewables. All major automotive companies (Ford, GM, Daimler-Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Toyota)have major fuel cell programs and demonstration vehicles on the road today.  Requirements for the commercialization of fuel cell technology are that devices are relatively inexpensive and that they will operate reliably over a wide range of power demands. Both of these requirements necessitate that active, stable, and cost effective electrocatalysts be developed to replace the expensive noble metals now used in alkaline fuel cell electrodes. Fundamental research on the development of amorphous and nanocrystalline materials has shown these materials to have excellent merit as electrocatalysts and corrosion resistant materials. The leading edge alkaline water electrolyser(AWE) can be pressurized and can approach the current density and packing efficiency of SPEWE. The key missing link is the incorporation of nanoengineering material developments in alkaline fuel cell (AFC) technology to significantly improve operating current density, packing efficiency etc.The combined (AWE/AFC)system offers significant performance attributes at a greatly reduced cost and system simplicity by sharing balance of plant components .The author has developed significant intellectual property in both cell design and materials that can be exploited in this proposal.

The objectives of this proposal are: (i) to fabricate optimal amorphous and nanocrystalline catalysts using rapid

solidification/thermal devitrification and sputter deposition (ii) to characterize the structural and chemical nature of these amorphous and nanocrystalline materials,(iii) to assess the corrosion and electrocatalytic performance and stability of amorphous / nanocrystalline materials for use in fuel cells using electrochemical

and surface analytical techniques such as AES and XPS,(iv) to integrate these materials into a system design involving both an electrolysis and fuel cell unit.

"The objective of the proposed research program is to continue developing suitable strategies for producing new high value-added products from lignins and other wood residues (or portions of each) available in British Columbia. These renewable resources are the most under-utilized yet dominant wood wastes from wood processing operations. Also, a recent glut in the world market of major commodity wood products is forcing Canada's forestry industry to be more cost competitive. Therefore, the need for developing new value-added products from these particular wood wastes is indeed pressing. Moreover, lignin's partial removal from black liquor during kraft pulping has two other very significant advantages:(1) it allows for increased pulp production in mills that are recovery boiler limited - many existing Canadian kraft mills already fall in this category; (2) it provides an option for pulping to a lower lignin content even at the same recovery boiler heat load, thereby generating substantial savings in bleaching chemicals as well as reducing effluent discharge loadings. In this research program, two approaches for developing high-value products from these wood wastes will be studied. One approach will investigate new catalytic upgrading routes with the objective of producing unprecedentedly high yields of useful fuels and chemicals. We will use two laboratory reactors (fluidized-bed and fixed-bed) separately or in tandem to study the performance of selected catalysts. For the promising route(s), the kinetics, mechanism(s), modeling, and optimum reaction conditions in terms of conversion, product yield and selectivity will be determined. The other strategy will study these waste materials (or portions of) for production of polyurethanes via solution casting, polymer blending, and other methods as appropriate. Mechanical, thermal properties and biodegradability of the new bio-plastics will be determined to develop the essential structure-property relationships. In each strategy, potential practical applications and economic benefits will be identified for the most promising products and processes.

"Current (Sept.-Oct., 2008) chaos in the finance market even after government intervention in USA and other countries has brought down the global economy to a great extent.  Some of the root causes of the problems are: the greed and competition have made many money managers to float complex financial instruments (credit default swap, collateralized debt obligation etc) without sound understanding of the actions and reactions of these instruments in the dynamic market environment; sub-prime mortgage boom in USA; and financial institutions failing  to constantly analyze the risk involved in their business. Increasing competition in the market drives the research for faster, and more accurate solutions for problems in finance that are complex and computationally intensive. Options are one of the common derivatives in the market. Pricing options is the backbone of major research problems in finance such as value at risk (VaR), portfolio optimization and complex derivatives. This drive has created a highly challenging area of research called computational finance. 

Dr. Thulasiram's research will use modern computers and computational techniques to study problems in finance. The activities proposed for research will address problems ranging from stock price prediction to mobile commerce, from option pricing to portfolio optimization and value at risk. Dr. Thulasiram's research employing advanced scientific techniques such as nature inspired algorithms will simplify the finance problem computationally and make it easier to understand the behavior of some of the financial instruments. The research results could help speed up the decision making process for investments and hence avoid potential financial losses for individuals and for institutions. Also, Dr. Thulasiram's research with the use of advanced computing and information technologies for finance problems will help the profit-making opportunities in the market place a reality. In addition, Dr. Thulasiram's research results from option pricing can be applied to solve some future problems in computing, for example, renting large number of computers located at various places (e.g., in a computational ""grid"") for use any time (like the Internet today).

"The global demand for animal proteins will substantially increase over the next 20-25 years. Therefore, improving the efficiency of food animal productivity is crucial. Fertility of bulls, or their frozen semen, is a major determinant of cattle production. Changes in the structure and function of sperm at the submicroscopical level (not detectable during routine semen evaluation) influence bull fertility. Increasing knowledge regarding the molecular basis of sperm development (spermatogenesis) and sperm function will have implications for improving fertility predictions in cattle. This proposal is based on the general hypothesis that comparison of morphologically normal versus grossly abnormal sperm (with distinct functional impairments) obtained from the same bull will be a suitable approach for accomplishing this goal. Any disruption in testicular thermoregulation induces abnormal sperm production. Based on this principle, we recently used scrotal insulation to impair sperm production in bulls, and we recovered normal (pre-insulation) versus abnormal sperm from the same bull (a unique advantage of this model compared to the use of laboratory animals). In preliminary studies using these sperm, we identified a novel molecule (testis-specific isoform of Na+/K+ATPase) involved in the regulation of sperm function, clearly demonstrating the potential of this model for creating new knowledge in gamete biology. The current proposal is a continuation of this study and is focused on investigating the molecular basis of the development and impaired function of pyriform sperm (pear-shaped sperm; the most common sperm abnormality in infertile bulls). I expect that this study will increase knowledge regarding spermatogenesis, regulation of sperm function and sperm contributions to early embryo development, which is the long-term goal of my research. At the applied level, this study may identify molecular markers of fertility, with important implications for improving animal productivity and understanding male-factor infertility at an interdisciplinary level. Moreover, this research program will train highly qualified individuals for academia and industry.

"The drug development process is of great concern to the pharmaceutical industry and of great benefit to

Canadians and others worldwide. Before a potential drug can make it to the marketplace, it must first undergo

an enormous amount of testing in order to assess the impact of various things on the effectiveness of the drug.

These include factors such as the tablet form, the drug concentration, and the storage conditions to name only a

few. For each of these tests, the pharmaceutical tablet must be analyzed for its contents in order to know if any

effects are noted on the composition. Currently, the actual analysis of such tablet contents is relatively rapid.

However, preparing the tablet contents for such an analysis is quite lengthy and presents a major delay in

analytical laboratory efforts to support the drug development process. As a result, increasing the speed of such

sample preparation methods can directly increase the speed of the drug development process. This research

looks at novel methods of pharmaceutical sample preparation that employ sub-critical fluids. Such fluids are

simply solvents held at elevated pressures and temperatures. However, under these conditions, they are much

more efficient at dissolving substances and isolating them for analysis. Relatively little is known about their

effectiveness in pharmaceutical tablet extractions. This work will explore the use of sub-critical organic

solvents, sub-critical water, and lower temperature organic solvent/liquid carbon dioxide mixtures in the

the effectiveness and usage of such extraction methods in this area and will advance current knowledge

regarding the capabilities of these techniques. It is anticipated that significant improvements will be realized in

the amount of time, solvent, and handling procedures that are required in preparing pharmaceutical tablets for

analysis relative to existing methods. In doing so, this will increase drug development speed and reduce

hazardous organic solvent usage, both of which can improve the lives of Canadians.","Rapid sample preparation of pharmaceutical tablets using sub-critical fluid extraction methods","Human pharmaceuticals",CANADA,CANADA,"Analytical chemistry"

"The research concentrates on the Abitibi greenstone belt, a region of old volcanic rocks that span the Ontario Quebec border from Timmins to Chibugamau. This belt of volcanic rocks is the source of the gold, copper and zinc that is the economic lifeblood of the region. Research as established that the many volcanic units are separated by iron rich sediments that represent pauses in volcanism. The iron-rich sediments vary in their contained minerals and their chemistry. The chemistry of these rocks vary as a function of how close they are to copper and zinc mineralization. The research will focus on how to use the variations in chemistry to identify likely areas with new mineral deposits. A second project will build a 3-D model of this belt of volcanic rocks. The model willbe built using computer based techniques and will result in improved ability to predict where future mines lie. A third aspect to the project will be to understand the controls on the variations in volcanism and production of sedimentary rocks with time. This aspect of the project will examine greenstone belts in Canada and elsewhere to establish the controls on what types of volcanic and sedimentary rocks occur where.

The convergence of atomic physics and condensed matter physics in optical lattices is a marriage of revolutionary potential. Trapped in standing waves of laser light, ultra-cold atoms are now poised to quantitatively emulate simplified models of electrons in a crystalline solid. A key example is the Hubbard model for electrons in a two-dimensional, planar lattice, which is widely presumed to be the relevant model for understanding high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in cuprate materials. In spite of the simplicity of this model, which includes only tunneling, Pauli exclusion, and on-site interaction,  no analytic or numerical calculation has shown definitively whether it can explain HTSC or other doped phenomena such as stripes. The primary barrier is that the calculational difficulty for quantum many-body problems can grow exponentially with the number of bodies, making calculations effectively impossible for even modest numbers of particles.



We propose to address this problem with neutral atoms in optical lattices. We will develop the measurement and manipulation tools necessary to solve the 2D Hubbard model (i.e., determine its phase diagram), learning which aspects of a real system are essential to the observed phenomena.  This means that one of the most important unsolved problems of solid state physics and materials science can now be addressed using the emerging technologies of cold atoms in optical lattices. Our efforts will take place in the context of an international collaboration with leading theoretical and experimental groups, ensuring that the optimal set of tools and analyses are used to realize the first quantum simulation of a problem beyond the grasp of classical computing.

"Space-time clustering is a signature of strongly correlated processes, and is a well-documented feature of earthquake seismicity.  These patterns provide important information about the earthquake source process, which will be studied here using several different advanced data sets and new, innovative analysis methods developed in the conjunction with the study of the physics of mean-field systems.  A method developed for identifying areas of increased probability, the PI index (Tiampo et al., 2002a,b), is based upon recent observational evidence that earthquake faults are characterized by strongly correlated space-time dynamics, as well as numerical simulations of earthquakes that also suggest that space-time pattern structures are non-local, a consequence of strong correlations in the underlying dynamics.  In recent work, this technique has been applied to seismicity from various tectonic regions around the world in order to detect systematic variations in seismic moment release in these regions.  The long-term goal is to establish a clear relationship between these spatiotemporal patterns and the underlying nonlinear dynamics.

Application of this method to the study of the fundamental fault structure and its potential links to the geodetic signals that are also the surface expression of underlying stress changes are the primary goals of this proposal.  The research can be broken down into two major areas.  First, important statistical properties of the seismic catalog data that have been recently identified will be incorporated into a systematic analysis method for studying the important features of the various local and regional tectonic stresses.  These studies will be extended across a variety of tectonic regions and spatial scales. Second, these methods will be extended to the study of the large quantities of geodetic data currently available from remote sensing techniques such as GPS and InSAR data.  These studies will further our understanding of the relationship between the physics of the nonlinear dynamics of faults, the correlated patterns that they generate in the observable data, and the coherent structures in the underlying stress field.

"There are two projects in this research proposal.  The first one deals with ``Asset Allocation with constraints"" and the second one concerns ``A Synthesis of Credit Risk Models"".



Specifically, the objective of the first topic is to analyze robust asset allocation roles from the investor's perspective. Investors are assumed to have risk preferences and other specific objectives or restrictions. Mathematically speaking, the problem can be reduced to one of maximizing expected utility subject to constraints. We intend to tackle the following three questions: (1). Solve the problem when the constraints are American-style, for instance, the dynamic VaR constraint; (2). Solve the problem when the market is (dynamically) incomplete, for instance when investors are precluded from short selling; (3). Solve the problem when investors have concerns about model misspecification. The solutions of the above three questions would deepen our current understanding in the investment area and also have practical applications. 



My second project concerns a synthesis of credit risk models. Currently there are two relevant approaches: Both the structural and the reduced-form are successful in certain circumstances. However the field lacks a uniform framework that combines the best features elements of these two approaches. The objective of this project is to extend the structural credit risk approach. This extension of the structural credit risk model will have both theoretical appeal and considerable practical value. For instance, it opens the way to develop and implement a uniform risk model that can accommodate credit risk, equity risk and interest rate risk.

"Reliability measures the ability of a system performing its intended functions. It is one of the most critical performance measures of today's engineering systems, such as manufacturing systems, aircraft systems, transportation systems and power systems. Most engineering systems are multi-state degraded systems in nature. That is, in addition to the completely working state and totally failed state, they have multiple degraded states or partial failure states in between. However, existing multi-state reliability analysis methods are not flexible and efficient enough to be applied to practical engineering systems with general and complex structures. And more effective approaches are to be developed to improve system reliability and life-cycle cost-effectiveness through system optimization and condition based maintenance. 

        The short-term objectives of this research program are to develop practical and efficient multi-state system reliability analysis methods for systems with general and complex system structures while considering various uncertainties, integrated design and maintenance optimization methods for multi-state degraded systems, and more accurate health condition prediction approaches for condition based maintenance. The long-term objective of this research program is to develop an integrated framework and a set of effective and efficient tools for the performance analysis, design, health condition assessment and prediction, and maintenance of systems and components with multiple degraded states, and apply them to practical engineering systems particularly manufacturing, aerospace, power and transportation systems. 

        With the success of this research program, accurate and efficient reliability analysis will be made possible for practical engineering systems, system performance and life-cycle cost-effectiveness will be much improved, and industrial accidents will be prevented. Major economic benefits will be generated for Canadian industries. Highly qualified personnel will be trained through this research program.

"This NSERC program of research addresses the mechanisms by which the strength of the heart beat is regulated in fish.  Although our primary interest is the salmonids which include rainbow trout, sockeye salmon and steelhead, other fish which function in warmer waters (e.g. zebrafish and tilapia) will be studied for an evolutionary perspective.  The salmonids are of great importance socially, economically and strategically in Canada.  How hearts from fish function is of great interest physiologically because their aquatic habitat exposes them to sudden and challenging changes in water ion concentrations (including Ca and Na), water temperature and pH that are not experienced by mammals in their terrestrial environments. Thus a major objective in this program of research is to understand how the environmental differences have dictated the molecular design of the hearts of these organisms. Another major objective is to understand how environmental changes (e.g. temperature and pH) acutely impact the basic regulatory mechanisms in the teleost heart on a molecular and cellular level, thereby impacting cardiac contractility. Cardiac contractility is quite variable but is regulated on a beat-to-beat basis by the amount of calcium (Ca) delivered to the contractile element and/or the sensitivity of the contractile element to Ca.  Thus this program of research will focus on the structure and function of specific proteins in the cells that make up fish heart that regulate calcium delivery and removal and the contractile response to these signals.  We will use techniques from bioinformatics, molecular biology, confocal microscopy, biophysics and physiology. 



Overall, we believe that this comprehensive approach to the understanding of the regulation of myocardial contractility in teleosts is unique in its scope and should yield significant new information about cardiac function in fish.

"Studies of the formation of beta-lactams, a vital part of penicillins and related antibiotics, will be carried out. The mechanism of formation of these materials by ketene-imine [2+2] cycloadditions will be examined, including measurements of the rates of reaction depending upon the substituents on both the ketenes and the imines, determination of kinetic isotope effects, and the direct observation of zwitterionic reaction intermediates. 



The reactions of bisketenes in these reactions will be examined, which we have already demonstrated lead to either bis(beta-lactams), or to aziridines. The scope of these reactions will be determined, and the use of the novel structures formed as possible new antibiotics will be surveyed.



Another investigation concerns free-radical chlorination of organic compounds, an important process in organic synthesis that is also significant in the formation and degradation of environmentally important organo-chlorine compounds.

"This project will explore the use of gallium arsenide-bismide alloys in infrared wavelength light emitting diodes. GaAs alloyed with bismuth, the heaviest group V element, is a narrow bandgap semiconductor alloy with interesting physical properties and a number of promising applications. In this project we explore the application of this material in one of these applications, namely as a light source for optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive medical imaging modality. The bismide alloys are attractive for this application for several reasons. Due to the unique electronic structure associated with Bi-alloying, the light emission spectrum from the material is much broader than for other III-V semiconductor alloys (~100nm). The width of the emission spectrum controls the resolution in OCT and is therefore an important figure of merit for an OCT light source. The reason for this anomalous behaviour is that Bi behaves in some respects as an impurity rather than as an alloying element. In addition when deposited on GaAs substrates the bismide alloys can cover the entire 850-1600 nm wavelength range of interest for OCT. Being compatible with the well established GaAs/AlGaAs laser technology they are amenable to high power operation and a mature manufacturing technology is available. The light source application is only one of a number of promising applications for the bismide alloys. The work in this proposal will advance the state of knowledge of growth

and properties of the new alloy that will benefit all applications of this exciting new ""made in Canada"" semiconductor material.","Wide spectrum semiconductor light source from GaAs-bismide alloys.","Medical equipment and apparatus",CANADA,CANADA,Semiconductors

"Biomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, lipids, and carbohydrates, exist in a microscopic universe with time and length scales 6-12 orders of magnitude smaller than the meters and seconds in which we measure length and time. They move rapidly on a time scale of nanoseconds and interact with individual water molecules the size of a few tenths of a nanometer. Most biomolecules are very small compared to the wavelength of visible light. This means they cannot be seen with ordinary microscopes, although there are many sophisticated experimental methods to measure aspects of the behaviour, shape, and interactions of biomolecules. Computer modeling is a complimentary approach to such experiments.



Using powerful computers and a description of how atoms interact with each other, it is possible to calculate in atomic detail how lipids, water and proteins move and interact in time. In recent years, this molecular dynamics simulation method has been a very powerful method to solve problems involving molecules of all types, including biomolecules. This research project is aimed at developing and improving a computational model of molecules at a level of detail that is one level coarser than individual atoms. We group together about 4 atoms in a single 'bead'. By looking at the average interactions of such groups of atoms, we create a 'coarse grained' molecular model. Although we lose detail, it is computational cheaper by several orders of magnitude to explore such models. Many phenomena of biological or material science relevance are very well described by this level of detail. This project focuses specifically on improving the accuracy of our description of peptides and proteins. If we are successful, we will be able in the future to understand the molecular basis of new antimicrobial agents, the aggregation of proteins and peptides and their interactions with cell membranes and other biomolecules, and design new biocompatible materials for bioengineering purposes.

"Adenovirus consists of a naked icosahedral capsid, double stranded DNA genome with inverted terminal repeats and a polypeptide attached to the 5' ends of the genome. At least three non structural proteins are encoded by adenoviruses, which are believed to function in transactivation of different promoters, maturation and translation of late mRNAs, DNA encapsidation and viral capsid assembly. In bovine adenovirus (BAdV) -3, the non structural proteins are 52K, 100K and 33K. Of these, 100K and 33K are  phosphonuclear proteins, which appear to be essential for BAdV-3 replication and, may be involved in DNA packaging, viral capsid assembly and efficient DNA/capsid interaction. We believe that involvement of 100K and 33K in different aspects of BAdV-3 virus assembly may require interaction of these proteins with other viral/cellular proteins. The hypothesis for this study is that non structural proteins contain multi-functions, which are important for viral replication and assembly. Moreover, ability of these proteins to perform multi-functions may require interactions with other viral / cellular protein(s). So the overall goal is to identify, characterize, map and determine the mechanism of performing different functions of 33K and 100K in the production of progeny virions. The specific goal of this grant is to investigate in detail the interaction of 33K and 100K with other viral/cellular proteins, which will help in determining the mechanism of performing different functions by these non structural proteins. The specific goal will be achieved by a) investigating the interaction of 33K and 100K with other viral proteins, b) investigating the interaction of 100K and 33K with cellular proteins, c) mapping the domains of 33K and 100K required for the interaction with other viral / cellular proteins and d) determining the importance of identified protein-protein interaction for BAdV-3 replication. 

The significance of this study lies in understanding the mechanism of functions performed by 100K and 33K proteins of BAdV-3, which may lead to the development of improved vectors for gene delivery and vaccination of humans and animals.

"Most people would agree that exercise for children is essential, but recent statistics tell us that 3 out of 5 Canadian children are not active enough for optimal growth and development, which this proposal defines as the healthy function of tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle).  The problems are that 1) the type of exercise that best promotes tissue health in children is unknown, and 2) we do not fully understand the mechanisms that translate exercise into optimal tissue function during human growth.  What we do know is that exercise in children activates immune factors with the capacity to benefit tissue function.

     The long-term goal of my research program is to clarify the role of the immune system in linking exercise with muscle adaptation during human growth.  I will first determine the type of exercise in children that results in a balance of immune factors that would be considered optimal for muscle adaptation.  I suspect that exercise mimicking children's play will result in this optimal balance.  I will next make use of the fact that childhood is characterized by periods of rapid growth to examine how maturation is associated with the growth effects of exercise.  I expect that more mature children will exhibit stronger growth-related responses to exercise, as this is required to sustain their increased growth rate.  With a clearer understanding of the above issues, I plan to implement novel approaches to uncover the properties of children's muscle cells that link growth-related processes with an exercise environment. 

     My research program proposes a new idea that a child's immune system works to help exercise optimize tissue function.  In today's society when most children are not active enough for optimal growth and development, the value of pediatric exercise science cannot be neglected.  Use of sophisticated and powerful approaches designed to reveal mechanisms that translate exercise into optimal growth and development will represent a significant contribution to the field.  Importantly, this program will produce information with broad importance to other disciplines interested in how muscle adapts to exercise in health and disease.

"The research program is concerned with essentially unsteady high-speed multi-dimensional compressible flows, which are much less explored in compressible fluid dynamics than steady phenomena and, likewise, accurate and efficient numerical methods and codes for them are few in number.  New numerical methods and computer codes specifically tailored for unsteady, multi-scale, multi-fluid flows with spatially-localized features (shock waves, contact surfaces, boundary layers, vortices etc.) will be developed on the basis of the previous work by the principal investigator on locally adaptive unstructured finite-volume Euler (inviscid) solvers for non-reacting gas mixtures. Three major generalizations are to be undertaken: (1) For unsteady viscous flows at high Reynolds numbers in which viscosity effects are confined to shock fronts, boundary layers and separation zones, contact surfaces; (2) For mixtures of fluids with various equations of state (Tait, JWL etc.) (3) For nonlinear acoustics problems in heterogenous media. The research program will encompass the following application areas: (I) Basic studies of shock wave reflections, in particular on the influence of viscosity and heat conductivity on shock wave reflections; (II) Starting of air inlets of hypersonic air-breathing engines (scramjets), including recenlty proposed innovative techniques (diapgragm rupture, accelerative starting); (III) Flow dynamics in gas/explosive systems. (a) Channel effect problem (when an explosive layer is detonated inside a planar or axisymmetrical channel) which has many applications in mining, aerospace, high-pressure physics and other fields; (b) Different concepts of hypervelocity launchers in which the enormous energy densities of high explosives is used to accelerate projectiles to hypervelocities, which can be applied to high-speed impact tests (e.g. when testing satellite bumper shields); (IV) Non-linear waves in heterogenous media. In this area the developed computational method will be used for simulations of wave phase conjugation in acoustics with practical applications in echography of biological tissues, non-destructive testing, magneto-acoustics etc.

"Turbulent flow is encountered in nature and in many engineering applications.  Despite extensive efforts, a complete understanding of turbulent flow appears to remain formidable.  Nevertheless, the cumulative advancement achieved, mostly via baby steps approached from a wide variety of perspectives, has shed additional light in recent years.  At the fundamental level, clean, isotropic and/or homogeneous turbulence will likely remain an important vehicle for further advancement.  Extreme diligence both in experimentation and in data reduction, along with improved analyses (such as wavelet analysis), are necessary to enhance progress along this path.  The intended research aims specifically at further exploitation of clean turbulence experimentations and analyses to hasten the pace of progress.  Also proposed in parallel is the continuation of detailed studies on the roles of turbulence in aerodynamics (wind turbines), combustion, and air distribution.  Some key advantages of the proposed parallel, fundamental-application approaches are: 1) continuous emergence of specifics, from the ongoing engineering research endeavour, available for the fundamental exploration, 2) immediate (realtime) exploitation of modest fundamental progresses onto the applied, engineering research.

"Understanding mountain building events requires determination of the changes in temperature and pressure that rocks experienced during those events, and in particular requires determination of the rates of vertical movement during those processes. A variety of techniques can be used to determine these changes in pressure and temperature, including the rates of these changes. The proposed research will combine geological mapping, studies of rock textures, analysis of the chemical compositions of minerals and rocks, and thermodynamic data to model the development of mineral assemblages, modes, and compositions. Comparison of measured values with model values allows determination of the pressure and temperature at which the mineral assemblage developed and how these values changed with time. The combination of this data with the radiogenic isotopic composition of minerals and rocks allows the timing of these changes to be calculated. The combination of the pressure, temperature, and time of formation of rocks leads to a better understanding of the nature and rates of mountain building processes. This study is specifically designed to use modern thermodynamic modelling techniques on an important group of rocks to determine the pressure, temperature, and time of rock formation, and to determine the chemical reactions that lead to partial melting of these rocks. In addition, the study will document how to thermodynamically model a particular class of rocks that have not been extensively modelled in the past, and will also document inadequacies in our current ability to model such rocks and identify future avenues of research to help overcome these inadequacies. This will results in an enhanced ability to use this class of rocks to determine the pressure-temperature-time history of mountain-building events.

"Bilingualism and multilingualism are substantially more prevalent globally than monolingualism, yet the vast majority of psycholinguistic research is based upon studies of monolingual people. One major challenge that bilinguals face is that they must acquire and represent all material required for at least two languages while flexibly determining when and how to use that knowledge. Early work indicated that bilinguals selectively access words from a language currently in use. However, compelling evidence now shows that bilinguals also access words in other known languages that look or sound similar to what is encountered. Although non-selective access, as it is termed, is widely accepted, its extent and scope remain unclear. For example, how does non-selective access in the face of cross-language ambiguity compare to within-language lexical ambiguity, how is it influenced by sentence or task context, how does it relate to individual differences in proficiency or other cognitive capacities, and does it also apply to spoken language? Answers to these questions are at the heart of current bilingual language processing models, such as BIA+ and BIMOLA. I propose to investigate questions regarding bilingual lexical processing using a highly sensitive measure of comprehension - eye movement recordings. Eye movement recording studies have important advantages over traditional psycholinguistic tasks, specifically, language processing is more natural and a range of measures can be examined that provide information about the early and later stages of comprehension simultaneously. I will address three interdependent questions in this work. First, how do bilingual adults comprehend words in semantic and non-semantic contexts while reading sentences? Second, how do bilingual adults comprehend words in context during spoken language, using the Visual World Paradigm? Finally, do individual differences in executive function correlate with critical comprehension measures obtained in these experiments? This research will advance our understanding of bilingual language processing and the cognitive capacities that modulate comprehension, thus leading to more globally realistic models of human language function.

"For the past four decades, clinicians have developed a growing appreciation for the toll exacted by a group of lethal neurological disorders collectively called the peroxisome biogenesis disorders. All these diseases affect the assembly of the peroxisome, an intracellular organelle that is required for the degradation and biosynthesis of lipids. Therefore to understand the bases of the peroxisome biogenesis disorders, we must understand how peroxisomes are made in the cell. Until recently, one of the basic tenets of cellular organization was that the peroxisome constitutes a singular organellar compartment. All peroxisomes in any cell type or tissue were assumed to be identical in terms of their protein and lipid composition, their ability to import various proteins or transfer lipid species, and their metabolic capacity. The peroxisome was also believed to be an autonomous organelle that by itself maintained a balance of its chemical composition and functional status, being unable to communicate with other organelles via membrane-enclosed carriers. Peroxisome assembly was thus seen as a process by which structurally and functionally identical peroxisomes increase in size by the posttranslational import of all proteins at the same time and by the transfer of all membrane lipids in bulk. The resulting peroxisomal population, uniform in terms of its structural and functional properties, was believed to replicate by the fission or budding of fully assembled peroxisomes. Recent work from our laboratory has challenged this ""textbook"" view. We have shown that the peroxisome population of a cell consists of both large mature peroxisomes and smaller immature peroxisomes. The immature peroxisomes give rise to mature peroxisomes through the ordered and progressive conversion of a more immature form to a more mature form. The experiments that we now propose are aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms controlling this multistep peroxisome assembly pathway in regards to peroxisome formation and stepwise maturation. Full knowledge of how peroxisomes assemble is fundamental to understanding the molecular bases of the peroxisome biogenesis disorders and lays the foundation for future therapeutic approaches to the treatment of these diseases.","Molecular mechanisms of peroxisome assembly","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Cell biology"
"With the increasing importance of the Internet in our daily lives, how do we protect against tampering by a malevolent eavesdropper? Can we be sure that nobody can steal our password required for e-banking? Or learn about our business strategy?  What do we do if all of our on-line communication is not secure?

Current communication security is based on mathematical assumptions. The problem with this approach is that we do not know if these assumptions are correct. Quantum Cryptography takes another approach. It bases security on fundamental, quantum physical laws.

Quantum Cryptography relies on the inevitable modification of the properties of individual light particles when someone tries to gain information about these properties. Hence, if we first send a key to our bank or business partner, and we encode this key into light particles, we can find out if somebody tried to listen in. Therefore, we can also know if nobody tampered with the key. Since we now have a secret key, we can use it to lock our information in a provable secure way, and only our partner can unlock it. 

Quantum Cryptography was first proposed in the 1980's, and the first commercial systems have now been available for a few years. Yet, it still suffers from low key distribution rates, requires better integration into existing communication architecture, and is currently limited to transmission distances of around 100 km.

QITSeCom + builds on Dr Tittel's extensive experience in bringing quantum cryptography and communication out of the laboratory into a real telecommunications network. It aims to conduct basic research into key elements of a quantum repeater, including quantum teleportation and quantum memory, which is required to challenge the distance barrier.

"Population-based optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms, differential evolution and ant colonies have diverse applications. These optimization methods have proven to be useful in many cases where conventional optimization methods encounter their applicability limits. However, population-based schemes have their own limitations. Specifically, they may often need considerable computational time to find a solution. This disadvantage becomes more visible the larger the population is, which is (almost) always the case when we deal with high-dimensional and/or complex optimization problems. Hence, methods by which to increase the speed of these techniques have been under investigation for quite some time. The main focus of this research will centre on development of methods to increase the speed of differential evolution and ant colonies. Oppositional concepts will be employed to accelerate the convergence of the methods while maintaining the necessary level of solution accuracy. Opposition-based approaches to optimization generally incorporate the simultaneous consideration of the solution and the opposite solution (chromosome and anti-chromosome, path and opposite path). Recent achievements in the successful design and use of opposition-based differential evolution encourage us to seek some fundamental answers with respect to a mathematical formalism for these techniques and to exploit the potentials of oppositional schemes for all population-based algorithms. Standard benchmark functions and metrics will be used to verify the better performance of opposition-based extensions of methods under investigation. As a real-world test case, segmentation of medical images, specifically breast and prostate ultrasound images, will be undertaken as well. Population-based methods have been used to extract objects from digital images in different ways. Their results, as reported in literature, are in some cases impressive. However, processing images with these methods are extremely expensive. This has restricted their use in practical cases. Any level of speedup is desirable here. Image data sets along with radiologist's ground-truth are available for experimental performance verification.","Oppositional concepts in population-based problem solving",Engineering,CANADA,CANADA,"Learning and inference theories"

"Juvenile hormone (JH) is the primary regulator of both the change in body form from larva to adult (metamorphosis) and the production of eggs (reproduction) in most insect species. JH must be present at appropriate times to stimulate the retention of larval characters or the growth of eggs. In its absence, these processes do not occur. Therefore the presence of JH at inappropriate times will disrupt the normal functioning of the insect. My laboratory has focused on the natural compounds that turn JH production on and off in pest species including cockroaches, moths and flies, with our major emphasis on the compounds responsible for turning JH production off. We have discovered a family of peptides (short chains of amino acids) termed allatostatins that are able to inhibit the production of JH. Some of our recent work has been directed to the development of mimics of these peptides that are resistant to breakdown and able to disrupt egg production. To this end, we have also been searching for additional allatostatin regulators of JH production in other pest species such as flies, since at present our knowledge of such compounds is largely confined to cockroaches. There are many related allatostatins in cockroaches but we know that these differ from those in other pest species such as moths and flies. This implies that allatostatins are highly specific, acting only on a narrow range of insects and it may be possible to exploit this specificity, by tailoring specific peptide mimics to act only on specific species. Our work has also focused on the receptors for allatostatins, the cellular keys responsible for the translation of the allatostatin signal since these molecules must be present in the insect's tissues to permit them to respond to the allatostatins. Expression of the receptors may permit the agrochemical industry to search for additional compounds that suppress JH production. We are also studying the JH-related compounds in the crustaceans, including lobster, shrimp and crab, with a view to identifying the regulators of crustacean reproduction and the peptides controlling their production. Such information may prove valuable to commercial aquaculture of lobster crab and shrimp, through the enhancement of growth and reproduction.

"Nitrogen fixation in legumes is an important natural mechanism in the global nitrogen cycle. Legumes can form symbioses with soil bacteria to develop specialized root structures called nodules.   The plant supplies carbon, obtained through photosynthesis, to the bacteria and the bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen, a  fundamental component of protein, DNA and other biomolecules, to a form usable by the plant.  This process is called nitrogen fixation.  In agricultural legumes, this provides an important mechanism to supply nitrogen to the diets of humans and livestock and requires far less artificial nitrogen fertilization.



In soybean and related legumes, fixed nitrogen moves as ureides from the nodules to leaves, pods and seeds, where they are then broken down, allowing the nitrogen to be utilized.  When water becomes limiting, ureides build up and nitrogen fixation ceases.  This process is extremely sensitive to water limitation, but we do not yet understand why.  The overall theme of the research program will be molecular and biochemical regulation of nitrogen metabolism in legumes.  The focus will be ureide metabolism and nitrogen fixation. Specific objectives include the identification of genes involved in ureide metabolism and determining how ureide catabolism is regulated.  The research program will integrate plant physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology to augment our understanding of ureide metabolism in legume species.  Currently, regulation of ureide metabolism is poorly characterized and this process has not been examined in any legume crop species at the molecular level.  As nitrogen fertilizer prices increase in response to rising energy costs, legume production becomes more attractive, both as crops with potential for biofuels, as well as those requiring less artificial nitrogen fertilizer.  Understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling ureide catabolism and nitrogen fixation in response to abiotic stresses, particularly those that may be brought on by climate change, will be critical in improving legume production through management practices, breeding or biotechnology.

"We propose a continuation of our long term project concentrated on the development of a rough classification

theory of set-theoretical structures that is suited for applications not only in set theory and logic but also to

some other areas of mathematics. Some of our rough-classification results (dichotomies) such as the Open

Coloring Axiom and the P-Ideal Dichotomy have seen in recent years a considerable sucess in applications to

such diverse areas of mathematics such as the theory of C*-algebras or the theory surrounding the von

Neumman problem about characterising Boolean algebras carrying strictly positive measures. However the

proper set-theoretical study of these dichotomies is yet to be completed. In particular, we would like to

examine whether any of these two dichotomies imply that the second uncountable cardinal is un upper bound

on cardinality of the continuum. 

We would also like to work on rough classification problem in other areas of mathematics which seem to

require set-theorectical tools. One particular such problem is the rough-classification problem of compact

Hausdorff spaces where the conjectured dichotomy  says that a compact Hausdorff space either contains an uncountable discrete subspace r it admits an at most 2-to-1 continuous map ontu a metric space.

Finally, we would also like to work towards a similar rough classification theory in the context of Decsriptive

Set Theory. It is well known that this field of mathematics is already rich with dichotomies of this sort. What we would like to develop is a rough classification theory of analytic graphs that are countably

cromatic in the Borel sense, or in other words Borel graphs that admit countable good Borel coloring. Specific

problem in this area whose solution is likely to contribute considerably to the development of such a theory is a

dichoromy involving the shift graph on the family of infinite sets of integers. This has an obvious connection

with the infinite-dimensional Ramsey theory an area of mathematics that was originaly

motivated by efforts towards building a rich rough classification theory of mathematical structures

"Our knowledge of the molecular composition of astrophysical bodies - comets, stars, nebulae - and of the space between the stars comes exclusively from the light that molecules in these environment emit, and from the light that they absorb from background sources.  This research program involves the study of these molecules in laboratories on Earth to determine their physical properties in great detail by recording the patterns of their emission and absorption of light using lasers and spectrometers. Some of these molecules are chemically stable, and we can study them directly.  Others are very reactive, and therefore live only a short time once created in a terrestrial environment (although they can survive for a long time in space, since there is very little matter there with which to react).  We make these molecules via electrical discharges and in specially prepared jets of gas.  Since they form only in small quantitites, we have to devise careful means to probe them with high sensitivity.



Recently, a new facility has become available for this research.  The Canadian Light Source in Saskatoon, SK is a synchrotron capable of producing very intense light beams at a wide range of wavelengths from the far-infrared to x-rays. One beam line at this facility is dedicated to far-infrared molecular spectroscopy.  The intensity of light we can obtain is far greater than conventional lamps can provide, which will greatly increase the sensitivity of our measurements.



We plan to study molecules containing chains of carbon, rings of carbon, alkali-earth metals, and silicon, focusing on those molecules that have already been detected in astrophysical sources, and on those of high potential for detection.  The research will help to clarify the chemcial composition of objects in the universe, and to provide information on the physics and chemistry of these regions.","Spectroscopy of molecules relevant to astrophysics and the atmosphere","Physical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Atomic and molecular studies"
"Genetic yield improvement of maize in North America of about 1% per year during the past 70 years has been associated directly with increased stress tolerance. We have shown that increased stress tolerance in newer maize hybrids manifests itself under stressful conditions in enhanced dry matter partitioning to the ear and kernels during the period bracketing silking and in the enhanced ability of leaves to both stay green and to maintain high leaf carbon exchange rates, which is termed functional stay green. The physiological mechanisms that underlie the response of these two traits to stress can be quantified by examining maize genotypes that are equal in every respect other than the traits of interest (i.e., near isogenic lines). The objectives of the proposed research program are (1) to evaluate effective methodologies to assess effects of stress on both kernel-formation dynamics and functional stay green among large numbers of genotypes, (2) to identify QTLs for these traits by applying the effective procedures to QTL mapping populations, and (3) to quantify the physiological mechanisms underlying kernel-formation dynamics and functional stay green using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) at the extreme ends of the spectrum for their response to stress. Results of studies under Objective #1 are important because the current procedures to evaluate either trait are very complex and cannot be done practically for large number of genotypes (i.e., measuring growth rate of individual plants within a population for kernel-formation dynamics and measuring leaf carbon exchange rate [CER] throughout the grain-filling period within the canopy). Results of the studies under the second objective will identify RILs that can be used for the studies under the third objective.  Studies on the physiological mechanisms underlying the stress tolerance response (i.e., Objective #3) will be carried out in our field hydroponic system in order to have maximum control over environmental variables and to enable in-depth investigations of dry matter accumulation and partitioning (including roots) and of leaf CER and fluorescence parameters throughout the life cycle. Stresses examined will include water, nitrogen and shade stress.","Physiological mechanisms controlling stress tolerance in maize","Crop management (pest,disease control and breeding)",CANADA,CANADA,"Stress physiology"

"Naturally occurring bacteria protect themselves by the formation of a sugary layer called a biofilm which allows them to resist to traditional cleansing techniques.  Cleansing equipment ""fouled"" with biofilms is a major cost in many industries such as pulp and paper production, food processing and soil remediation. The ability of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) to kill bacteria is documented but not well understood.  Supercritical carbon dioxide is simply carbon dioxide (present in our breath and making up about 0.04% of the atmosphere) at pressures higher than 73 atmospheres and temperatures higher than 31 Celsius.  Supercritcal carbon dioxide has properties that are useful to sterilization.  The gas-like properties of SC-CO2 allow it to readily penetrate to the bacteria. Its liquid-like properties allow a much higher concentration of carbon dioxide to reach the bacteria compared to the gas. This project will explore how SC-CO2 kills bacteria using advanced theoretical techniques combined with computer simulation and determine if SC-CO2's antimicrobial capability can be further enhanced with small amounts of specially selected bactericidal molecules. Two types of additive will be studied: 1) short bactericidal proteins and 2) antioxidants.  Because little or no theoretical modelling of bacterial membranes in SC-CO2 has been done, this research program is likely to yield novel results that may have a positive economic impact on industries affected by bacterial biofilm ""fouling"".

"The proposed research program is in the area of Pure Mathematics called Asymptotic Geometric Analysis.  This area -- by virtue of its general framework, techniques it uses and develops, and impact on related areas -- can be situated at the ""crossroads"" of many directions of mathematics.  In particular, directions I plan to study in the next years are motivated, besides their intrinsic interest, by questions (and recent progress) in probability, Banach space theory, convex geometry, random matrix theory, asymptotic combinatorics and learning theory, among others.  On the other hand, based on the present common experience, one can expect that solutions obtained within AGA may influence these other fields, leading to a fruitful mutual cross-fertilization.



While Asymptotic Geometric Analysis takes its roots in ""classical"" functional analysis, it brings into this field a new asymptotic point of view, that studies quantitative forms of properties of interest -- ""approximate"" symmetries of sorts -- and their behaviour when the dimension, or a number of other relevant free parameters, tends to infinity. This allowed to successfully resolve questions that could not be tackled by earlier more ""rigid"" methods.

"Conventional methods for monitoring organic compounds in contaminated sites rely on sample collection, transportation, storage, preparation and instrument analysis by gas chromatography (GC) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Although the conventional laboratory analysis provides high accuracy, sensitivity and selectivity, it is expensive, time-consuming and discontinuous. To address this issue, cavity enhanced fibre optic sensors will be developed for detection of organic contaminants. The proposed sensors are capable of real-time and on-site measurements. The short-term objective of the proposed research is to design, construct and characterize prototypes in the laboratory. The long-term objective will focus on miniaturization of the instrumentation, followed by on-site field measurements and remote site deployment.

    In the proposed optical fibre sensors, subtle optical attenuation will be detected using fibre-cavity ring-down spectroscopy (FCRDS), a sensitive absorption technique where the optical cavity can be formed by two dielectric coatings on both fibre ends or a simple fibre loop. The effective optical path length can be increased by two orders of magnitude in such a cavity configuration. Chemical sensing blocks will be introduced using a number of approaches. In summary, the proposed research will bring the laboratory to the samples rather than the samples to the laboratory. The proposed research will deliver new insight on the environmental impacts of organic contaminants and a new level of surveillance and safety that is required by commercial labs, decision makers and the public. Initial applications will focus on (i) air quality monitoring where the loss of sample during transport is problematic and (ii) drinking water monitoring where real-time data acquisition is critical.","Cavity enhanced fibre optic sensors","Pollutants and toxic agents (waste, use 902)",CANADA,CANADA,Spectroscopy

"In northwestern Canada, freshwater fishes face ecological constraints, disturbances and opportunities. How they affect fish species, populations, and communities is the focus of my NSERC-supported research program.  (1)A dominant natural disturbance is ""winterkill"" caused by low oxygen under the ice. To test if this disturbance is dependent on the location (position) of lakes in a landscape, we will analyze relations between fish occurrence and indices of lake position. (2)Fathead minnows frequently dominate winterkill-prone lakes, but infrequently co-occur with predatory northern pike. Why? Minnows respond behaviourally to chemical signals of pike predation in ways that increase short-term survival, but may affect longer-term survival and reproduction. We will conduct a replicated pond experiment to assess population-level costs to minnows of short-term anti-predator behaviours. (3)In addition to direct effects of predation, minnows co-occurring  with pike also differ in life history traits from those in lakes lacking pike.  To determine if this reflects a genetic or ecological response, we are conducting a ""common garden"" experiment that involves raising fish from the two types of populations in adjacent ponds and comparing reproduction and recruitment. (4)Stocking sportfish into lakes adds a non-native predator that can have severe consequences to some lake communities. We are using provincial stocking programs as whole-lake experiments to understand what factors can buffer communities against negative stocking effects. (5)In some Canadian lakes, > 1 variety of a single species co-occur that differ in their morphology and ecology. Surveys in Great Bear Lake suggest that up to 4 varieties of lake trout co-occur in shallow water habitats.  We will quantify the morphological differences of these varieties, and determine if they also differ in their ecology and life history. Learning how fish cope with such environmental challenges can help management agencies deal with human-caused disturbance (e.g., cattle grazing adjacent to prairie streams) and the conservation of rare species and varieties that live in such environments.","Fish ecology on the boreal plains and western arctic","Environmental impact of economic activities (including agriculture)",CANADA,CANADA,"Aquatic ecology and limnology"
"In Canada, conservation and management of aquatic habitat is governed by the principle of No Net Loss (NNL) of the productive capacity of fish habitat. Thus, when fish habitat is altered, disrupted or destroyed by human activities, habitat compensation is required to offset the reduction in the ecosystem's productive capacity. Reviews of habitat compensation projects, however, indicate that because of our limited understanding of fish habitat needs, only a minority of compensation projects achieve NNL. Habitat compensation projects are essentially ecological experiments, from which we can advance our knowledge, and should be treated as such; thus, it is important that fish habitat management team up with aquatic scientists in compensation projects to improve our understanding of the productive capacity of aquatic habitats as well as our ability to design and evaluate compensation ""experiments.""

Diavik Diamond Mines, Inc. (DDMI) has proposed a pair of compensation projects in the Lac de Gras (NWT) watershed that involve increasing access to and connectivity among small headwater lakes, their lake-outlet streams, and Lac de Gras itself. We are proposing, in collaboration with DDMI, an interdisciplinary research program that integrates fisheries and hydraulic science to improve both our knowledge and the defensibility of habitat management in northern Canada. Three PhD students will incorporate Before-After-Control-Impact designs into their field research, combined with field and laboratory experiments and computational modeling, to assess production gains resulting from these projects and advance our understanding of the ecology and life history of northern fishes, the performance of nature-like fishways, and the functioning of Barrenlands ecosystems. The proposed study brings together DDMI and the University of Alberta (and Fisheries and Oceans Canada), but it is also a collaborative research effort among three complementary investigators representing freshwater ecology, arctic fisheries, and hydraulic engineering. Our study will improve the state of ""compensation science"" in Canada and train much needed HQPs in northern aquatic science.

"Nano-reinforcements have offered different benefits in compared with marco- and micro-reinforcements, such as higher reinforcing effect in therm of mechanical properties, improved physico-chemical properties (thermal, barrier, fire resistance, etc), and functional properties in the case of nanotubes, while the reinforced materials have the same or almost the same characteristics of the matrix in therm of low density and ease in processing. As the raising of oil cost due to the reduction in reservation and political problems, and the raising concern over pollution and global warming effect, the movement into sustainable and renewable sources becomes very encouraged. The objective of this project is to develop sustainable and renewable bio-nanocomposites from bio-nanofibres and bio-polymers. Due to the small size of nanofibres and their incompatibilities with engineering synthetic (such as polyolefin) and bio-based thermoplastics, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), pol(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), etc., it is very difficult to obtain a full dispersion of individual nanofibres in such polymer matrices. Thus, the maximum advantages of the cellulose nanofibres cannot be taken. The project will develop the compounding technology to disperse cellulose nanofibres in polymer, both synthetic and bio-polymer, and optimize the interface between the two phases.  This technology exclusively involves the design and functionalisation of either the cellulose nanofibres or/and the polymer to render them more compatible with each other when the two are combined by means of different newly-developed melt compounding techniques, including single screw extruder (SSE), twin screw extruder (TSE), and extensional flow mixer (EFM) if necessary.  The developing technology is expected to facilitate the dispersion and improve the interfacial interaction.  Finally, this research program also aims for validating the developed concepts and technology to industrial application.

Investigations will be carried out first by means of computation and experiment to design and develop the functional cellulose nanofibres or/and the modified polymer matrix (if necessary, depending on the polymer matrix) suitable for the manufacture of polymer nanocomposites.  The work will involve evaluating and optimizing the interaction between the nanofibres and the polymer matrix so as to achieve good interaction between the phases that will lead to optimum dispersion.

The main emphasis of the work will be on synthetic polyolefins (PO) since they are the most difficult matrix to render compatible with cellulose nanofibres. However, the insights obtained and the approaches developed for POs will not be limited to these materials; they should also be useful for improving the compatibility of other polymer matrices as well. Then the developing approaches will be expanded and adapted for bio-polymers, such as PLA, PHB and starch.

"In Canada, energy is one of the most critical factors for the growth of the nation's economy.  However, much of Canada's and the world's energy is derived from burning fossil fuel, which has a major impact on the environment, especially in the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a major greenhouse gas - that is emitted, leading to global warming and climate change. Currently, a large amount of CO2 is being produced from industrial sources such as coal-fired power plants, etc.  To overcome the CO2 emission problem in industry, there is great interest, especially in western Canada, in capturing CO2 and utilizing it as a flooding agent for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions has two important benefits: (i) the captured CO2 can be marketed as a commodity, especially for EOR, offsetting the cost of reducing emissions; and (ii) we will be able to make the large-scale emission reductions necessary to meet reduction targets, which are set so as to mitigate as much as possible the damage anticipated to occur as a result of climate change. The long-term goal of the proposed research program is to develop more effective CO2 separation processes for separating CO2 from industrial gas streams, such those produced by coal-fired power plants and oil-sand facilities, at significantly lower capital and operating costs and with minimal operating problems.  Another long-term objective is to develop and maintain a strong research group in Canada that is focused on issues of CO2 production for EOR and CO2 greenhouse gas control technologies in order to serve Canadian industries and communities, especially in western Canada where fossil fuel production is the primary economic driver and where reliance on fossil fuel combustion for electricity is both significant and, at present, necessary. This research program is expected to produce more effective and efficient CO2 separation technologies, better understanding of high efficiency gas treating systems, and tools to enable industry to implement and operate CO2 capture processes at greatly reduced costs.  Ultimately, the research is expected to achieve significant savings in both capital and operating costs for CO2 separation processes.","Fundamental studies of high efficiency gas treating systems for co2 (greenhouse gas) capture and separation using reactive formulated solvents",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical engineering"

"Nerve cells are connected to each other by tiny contacts, called synapses. The majority of excitatory synapses in the brain are formed onto highly specialized cellular structures known as dendritic spines. It is generally accepted that every spine forms at least one synapse and represents a distinct biochemical compartment operating independently from neighboring synapses. Surprisingly, about one third of neurons in the brain lack spines and receive excitatory afferents directly onto the dendritic shaft. While signal transduction in this case presumes a certain degree of cross talk among individual synapses, this does not happen and synaptic communication in aspiny neurons remains confined to activated synapses without affecting neighboring ones. This raises an important question: that is, how may aspiny neurons accomplish diffusionally isolated and synapse-specific signal transduction? We propose that synapses formed by different afferents possess specific postsynaptic mechanisms for functional biochemical compartmentalization, which produce signaling microdomains with specific properties and distinct physiological roles. To determine the synapse-specific mechanisms of postsynaptic calcium compartmentalization in aspiny neurons, we will examine postsynaptic Ca2+ signals at two types of excitatory synapses of hippocampal CA1 basket cells: synapses innervated by the Schaffer collaterals and the perforant path. A combination of two-photon microscopy, electrophysiology, pharmacology, and molecular techniques will be used to assess the spatio-temporal profile of postsynaptic Ca2+ signals within different synapses as well as their regulation and physiological significance. 

This study will be of value to cell biologists and neuroscientists working in the fields of neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. It is unique in that it will combine the approach of double pre- and postsynaptic fluorescent labeling in live preparations, allowing for monitoring the postsynaptic Ca2+ signal at visually identified single synapses. Such an approach sets the stage for future studies of functional biochemical compartmentalization under physiological conditions of neuronal activity.","Functional biochemical compartmentilization in aspiny neurons","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,Electrophysiology

"The first area of this investigation is the fatigue design of components subjected to variable amplitude service loads.  Current design methods do not take into account the changes in the fraction of each stress-strain cycle for which a fatigue crack is open and growing caused by the large cycles in this kind of loading.  Large tensile and large compressive stress peaks cause reductions in crack opening stress levels making more of the stress-strain cycle available to drive crack growth.  This makes the fatigue life shorter than predicted by current design methods.  We have developed a model that correctly predicts crack opening stresses and gives accurate fatigue life predictions for service load histories.  The present project will attempt to find a simple correlation between metal deformation properties and the constants for the model.  This will replace calibration of the model by the time consuming measurement of changes in the crack opening stresses of small cracks after single overload peaks.



The second proposed area of investigation is a continuation of current research into the mechanisms and mechanics of bond failure by fatigue in corroded concrete beams and methods of repairing the corroded beams.  In spite of the prevalence of bond failures after corrosion, especially for repeated loads, no comprehensive research is available in the literature.  We clarified the differences in the way the bond breaks down in unstrengthened beams and in beams strengthened by boron fibre wraps.  In the former progressive splitting of the concrete at the level of the reinforcing steel is followed by crushing of the concrete above the steel by the lugs on the steel bars.  In the second case, the concrete is confined by the wraps, concrete crushing is observed both above and below the steel bars and the fatigue strength of the beam is increased.  In continuing this work, we plan to extend the number of variables in the test program and to develop an analysis and design procedure.

"Nerve cells that detect mechanical signals are important for a wide range of senses, such as touch, hearing, balance and pain. They also monitor the position of the body. Mechanosensitive ion channels in the specialized nerve endings open in response to sensory stimuli and ion flux thorough these channels causes a change in membrane potential. This leads to propagation of nerve impulses along the sensory axon, release of neurotransmitter from the axon terminal and transfer of the sensory information to the cental nervous system. Propagation of nerve impulses can be modulated by synaptic inputs from other neurons. Our research program aims to learn how the mechanosensory neurons develop and the detailed processes involved in mechanosensation. The experimental animal we use is a large moth, Manduca sexta, that undergoes a full metamorphosis from an egg to a caterpillar to a pupa, finally emerging as an adult moth. The adult neural development occurs during the two-week pupal period, during which the nervous system is relatively easily accessible for experimental research, making it possible to perform experiments at each developmental stage. The mechanosensory neurons that we study are located in long appendices, the antennae, and can be easily isolated and used in experiments that would not be possible in mammals. Our research program aims to learn the specific molecular interactions that occur between the sensory neurons and other cells to guide the developing nerve axons to their final destinations in the brain. We also want to learn the molecular structures of the mechanosensitive components and the mechanisms involved in placing them to the sensory endings of these neurons. The knowledge that we gain from this research will offer insight in the cellular and developmental processes in an experimentally accessible insect mechanosensory system. However, many of the structures and processes are similar in vertebrate mechanosensory organs that are significantly less accessible for experimental research.","Development of insect mechanosensory neurons","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,Neurophysiology

"We seek funding for 24 days of ship-time on the MSV John Strickland to collect samples for measurements of trace gases, microbial community structure, metalloproteins and trace metal concentrations / isotope ratios in Saanich Inlet, a coastal BC fjord. The research project is part of a developing time-series program aimed at understanding the seasonal evolution of biogeochemical and microbial processes across oxic and anoxic regions of the water column. Specifically, we seek to understand how the seasonal cycle of oxygen consumption and deep water renewal affects: 1) the concentrations of several important greenhouse gases (e.g. methane and nitrous oxide); 2) the taxonomic composition and functional gene expression of microbial populations; and 3) the redox state and isotope composition of dissolved Chromium. In addition, we will also collect large volume samples for the analysis of novel metal-containing proteins, and deploy sediment traps to estimate the rates of particle sinking fluxes in the inlet.  Sampling will be conducted on 12 two-day expeditions, with subsequent processing of collected material occurring in our land-based laboratories.","Molecular biogeochemistry of trace gases and metals in Saanich Inlet, BC","Oceans, seas and estuaries",CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical oceanography"

"In business applications, people frequently need to analyze complex information and make decisions.

Visualization tools assist data analysis by visually representing complex information (e.g., sales and profit data

broken down by time, product categories, and geographical regions). Interactive visual representations allow

business managers to interactively explore relationships in large datasets to support decision-making.

Business users often work together to solve problems and make decisions, particularly when each user has

unique expertise to offer. We propose to analyze and improve the collaborative visualization process by

designing techniques that will better enable users to analyze data in pairs or small groups. We believe that by

working together collaboratively users will achieve two benefits that help to bridge the gap between novice

users and expert analysts: (1) two heads are better than one, and (2) novices can learn from an expert.

To enable collaborative visualization, we need tools that are specifically designed to support collaborative

work. Current visualization technology has been designed for single users on desktop computers, and does not

come close to supporting seamless collaboration. We will examine how the design of visualization tools effects

collaborative analysis tasks, primarily for business applications. We will begin by observing how users work

collaboratively with existing visualization tools, and then develop and evaluate new techniques based on our

initial findings. We will focus primarily on co-located collaboration (i.e. collaboration at the same time in the

same place), because this provides a ""best case"" for collaborative work: users have maximum awareness of

each other's actions and facial expressions. Based on these experiences, we will begin to examine which

elements may need to be added to support collaboration over distance and over time when this awareness is not

directly present.","Collaborative visualization for business intelligence","Information, computer and communication technologies",CANADA,CANADA,"Information technology"
"Applications such as architectural design and scientific research depend on data analysis to identify problems and develop new ideas. However, data analysis can be challenging, especially when data sets are large and multidimensional. Visualization tools aid data analysis by allowing people to interactively explore data values and relationships. A critical element of the visualization design process is evaluation, where candidate visualization techniques are critically analyzed, usually with involvement of end users. Evaluation helps to determine whether visualization tools are effective and suitable for particular tasks and applications. The overall objective of this research program is to improve the evaluation process, through critical reflection on various evaluation methods. The research particularly emphasizes qualitative evaluation methods and eyetracking, which have been applied only to a limited extent in the visualization field. A secondary objective is to conduct a series of evaluation studies for various applications, which will add to the growing body of empirically-derived visualization design guidelines.



Empirical evaluation of visualization techniques is a growing trend, and continues to identify valuable principles of visualization design. This research will add to these design guidelines by expanding the types of evaluation studies that are performed. Furthermore, this experience with many different evaluation methods will enable the methods themselves to be improved.","Empirical examination of design issues in multidimensional visualization","Information systems and technology",CANADA,CANADA,"Information technology"

"This project proposes research on several classical and recently posed

problems in discrete geometry related to so-called geometric incidences.

Erdos-type problems in discrete geometry often translate directly

into incidence problems, with the distance problems being the

flagship example. Over the last few decades, geometric incidence

theory was very productive. This is due largely to the successful

methods associated with it, such as random sampling over finite

VC-dimensional range spaces and the crossing number theory, which lead

to innumerable new discoveries. They had tremendous impact on modern

geometric algorithms and data structures, extremal combinatorics,

"We will work on failure detection and leader election, and on implementations of shared objects that

are wait-free, non-blocking, or obstruction-free, as we briefly explain below.

Failure detectors are extensively used by the research community as a fundamental tool for fault-tolerant

distributed computing. We will continue our work on the specification, implementation, and use of

various types of failure detectors for solving different problems in asynchronous and partially synchronous

systems, in both the message-passing and shared-memory models of computation. We will initially focus on

Omega, a failure detector that can be considered an (eventual) leader elector. In particular, we will seek to

(a) develop algorithms for Omega that are stable, message-efficient, and work in dynamic environments

under weak system assumptions, (b) derive corresponding lower bounds (e.g., determine the weakest

assumptions, in terms of system synchrony and failures, that support the implementation of Omega), and

(c) implement, experimentally evaluate and compare several practical algorithms for Omega; this will be done

in our distributed system lab and the best algorithms will be integrated in a general failure detector service

package that will be available for public download.

In the shared-memory model, we will investigate a relatively recent concept, namely obstruction-freedom,

and its relation to two stronger progress requirements, lock-freedom and wait-freedom. As part of this work,

we would like to determine the ``weakest'' synchronization primitive that supports obstruction-freedom, and

whether obstruction-freedom can be achieved ``arbiter-free''. Our initial investigation shows that obstruction-

freedom can be achieved with a register (called abortable register) that is weaker than safe registers, and we

want to determine whether abortable registers are in some sense ``minimal'' and whether they are arbiter-free.

We also intend to investigate the following question: How ``hard'' is it (in terms of system assumptions)

to transform obstruction-free implementations into non-blocking or wait-free ones?","On failure detection, leader election and abstruction-freedom","Information, computer and communication technologies",CANADA,CANADA,"Distributed and parallel processing"

"The proposed research aims to develop efficient algorithms for solving geometric problems that arise in the following areas. (1) The exploration of algorithms for the reconfiguration of different types of linkages in 2 and 3 dimensional space, under various restrictions on the types of motions allowed. Another goal is to explore under what conditions linkages are ""stuck"" in the sense that they cannot be reconfigured to a flat convex configuration. These results are relevant, not only to robotics, but to protein folding in molecular biology. (2) One of the most promising approaches to pattern recognition is the nearest-neighbor decision rule (also referred to as instance-based learning). It is proposed to improve the space and time efficiency of state-of-the-art nearest neighbor rule algorithms, by incorporating proximity graphs. A second objective is to develop new measures of string similarity and polygonal chain similarity for pattern recognition problems. (3) It is proposed to explore the application of computational geometric tools to problems that arise in music information retrieval and music theory. These problems range from measuring the similarity of rhythms and melodies, to performing cluster and phylogenetic analyses of families of rhythms, with the goal of obtaining a deeper understanding of both, music theory and practical applications to music information retrieval. (4) Traditionally the scientific analysis of textiles has been carried out on several physical structural levels of the fabrics. However, a scientific analysis of the geometric structure of the patterns that appear on the textiles has been largely ignored. We propose a new approach to the scientific study of textiles that breaks with this tradition: the phylogenetic analysis of geometric patterns that decorate the textiles. At the heart of our approach is the design of a measure of dissimilarity between two textile patterns, that mimics the way in which biologists measure the dissimilarity between two DNA molecular sequences, i.e., the minimum number of mutations (simple local and global transformations) required to transform one textile pattern into the other. This research will have an impact of image-based search on the internet, as well as textile retrieval systems for use in museums and libraries.","Computational geometry for polygonal reconfiguration, pattern analysis and recognition and music information retrieval","Information, computer and communication technologies",CANADA,CANADA,Algorithms

"Stream 'barbs' are a new form of stream-bank erosion control structure that is designed for installation along the (erosion-prone) outside banks of stream bends.   Barbs differ from the more traditional revetment-type bank protection measures, (e.g., rock rip-rap and gabion structures), in that:  (i) they use considerably less material than is required in the traditional approaches, and (ii) they actively counteract the flow mechanisms that cause erosion and also promote deposition of sediments in the vicinity of the eroding bank.   Accordingly, barbs are an economically attractive alternative approach to solving the bank erosion problem.  They also represent a superior long-term solution to this problem. 



The applicant's continuing research work on this subject will proceed in two phases.   Phase one will be a combined mathematical modeling/laboratory study that will: (i) examine the hydraulic performance of various arrangements of model barbs installed in channel bends of different curvature when operating under mobile bed conditions, (ii) investigate the impacts of barbs on the large-scale turbulence structure of the bend flow fields, and (iii) on the basis of (i) and (ii), develop appropriate design criteria to help promote a wider application of the barb structure for stream bank protection.



Phase two will be a complimentary field study that will monitor the hydraulic performance of a barb system to be installed in an unstable bend of Ottawa's Sawmill Creek in the Fall of 2008/Winter of 2009.  Sawmill Creek is an urban stream formed in glaciomarine (Champlain Sea) clay deposits.   This will be the first time in North America that barbs are used to stabilize an eroding bank of a channel formed in clay.   Accordingly, this field test will present a unique opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of applying this new form of bank-protection structure to streams formed in clay deposits.

"This project has two long-term objectives: 1. To develop models that address the impacts of downstream infrastructures in recycled end-of-life product operations on a number of important variables, including manufacturers' investment in product design changes, manufacturers' and recyclers' profits, prices that end-users face, and social welfare. 2. To develop models that address the interaction between downstream infrastructures and different product generations associated with product design changes.  

   The development of environmentally friendly product designs is widely recognized as an important characteristic of an environmentally sustainable economy. In achieving this goal, effective incorporation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is expected to lead to product design improvement and effective recycling, especially in complex and durable products such as electrical and electronic equipment and vehicles. The potential benefits associated with EPR laws are well understood in the EU and in Japan. Unfortunately, governmental institutions and industrial companies in Canada seem to be lagging behind in implementing EPR laws. 

   Concerning the implementation of EPR, a fundamental question arises: How can policy-makers create incentives that encourage product design changes? To answer this question, one cannot ignore the impacts of downstream infrastructures on manufacturers' operations as a whole. The suggested research framework will take into account important characteristics of recycling activities of end-of-life products that have not been included in previous work. Examples of these characteristics include economies of scale in recycling costs and existence of a non-profit organization that allocates products to recyclers.

"Because vision is poor in young infants, hearing is important for learning about the world and interacting with caregivers. The auditory sense is also the main carrier of linguistic and musical information. The overarching goal of the research is to understand auditory developmental processes and the role of experience in shaping them. The research will focus on four areas. (1) Effects of experience on learning rhythms. Previous research indicates that young infants can process complex musical rhythms, but that infants lose this ability by one year of age if the music of their culture contains predominantly simple rhythms, as is the case with Western music. Here we investigate the role of early musical experience and whether brain plasticity enables Western toddlers to quickly learn complex rhythms if exposed to them. This work is important for understanding musical development and brain plasticity. (2) Understanding how infants combine sound components to form identifiable auditory objects. Just as infant learn to recognize objects by seeing them in visual scenes, they must learn to recognize the sounds that objects make, even when several objects are sounding at the same time.  Understanding how this ability develops is critical for understanding the deficits involved in central auditory processing disorders and how children learn in noisy environments such as classrooms. (3) Discriminating and recognizing voices. Successful social interaction depends on recognizing people by their voices. We will investigate developmental changes in voice recognition over the first year after birth, examining the role of experience with human voices in this process. (4) Effects of musical training on attention. A number of studies suggest that music lessons are beneficial for other cognitive domains such as language and mathematical skill. Here we investigate whether this occurs because learning to play a musical instrument trains attentional skills that enhance learning across many domains.  This research could elucidate the reasons why musical training is beneficial, and inform educational policy for the benefit of children.","Auditory development and the role of experience in infants and young children","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)",CANADA,CANADA,"Cognitive science -- development"
"My research proposal deals with analysis and simulation of traffic, protocols, and control algorithms in high-performance packet networks.



Packet data networks, such as the Internet, are the infrastructure for delivering voice, data, and video applications. Their performance depends on a complex interaction of network traffic, protocols, and scheduling mechanisms employed in network elements (routers). Evaluating this performance is a difficult task that is of importance both to service providers and network users. The objective of my research is to first characterize, model, and analyze traffic that is collected and measured from deployed packet networks. Of particular interest is application of statistical, data mining, and clustering approaches in the search for traffic invariants as well as the understanding of underlying dynamical behavior of the complex system representing a packet network carrying such traffic. 



The proposed research program covers three subareas: analysis and characterization of traffic data collected from deployed networks, simulation and improvement of network protocols and algorithms and evaluation of network performance, and application of control theory towards the analysis of complex dynamic network behavior. Collected traffic data will enable us to examine various aspects of traffic data collection, user behavior, and network operation and to evaluate performance of deployed routing protocols. Simulation tools and models will be developed to evaluate and improve performance of various wired and wireless network protocols and algorithms. Developed mathematical models of network protocols and mechanisms will be used to better understand complex behavior, such as chaotic and bifurcation phenomena, that has been observed in models of TCP/IP networks.

"High energy costs, high mill sludge disposal costs and more stringent environmental regulations in recent years have forced many pulp and paper mills to burn, or consider burning sludges, agricultural residues, shredded tires, construction waste, petroleum coke in their biomass boilers to increase energy production, to lower sludge disposal costs, and to profit from waste tipping fees. However, burning these non-traditional fuels in existing biomass boilers can be problematic, due to the large difference in composition, heating value and combustion behavior of the individual fuels. 

     The objectives of the proposed research program are i) to characterize the combustion behaviors of mixtures of biomass and various types of alternative fuels that may be available to pulp and paper mills in Canada, and the chemical and thermal properties of the resulting ashes, ii) to evaluate the potential impacts on fouling and corrosion in and emissions from biomass boilers, and on ash disposal, iii) to use the information obtained to develop criteria for burning mixed fuels in biomass boilers and to devise viable strategies for pulp and paper mills to increase their energy production efficiency, boiler availability, and mill profitability.

     The results are expected to provide significant insight into how mixed fuels burn, what types of deposits may form on the boiler tubes, and how the combustion environment may change and cause fouling and corrosion problems in biomass boilers. Pulp and paper mills, particularly those in Canada, are expected to benefit through increased mill energy production, decreased steam used for sootblowing, improved boiler thermal efficiency, prevention of costly unscheduled shutdowns due to fouling, plugging and corrosion, and through reduced mill sludge disposal costs. The research program will provide direction for better and safer means of treating peat and straw, which are abundant in Ontario, as a reliable fuel source, and help make good use of mill sludges, construction waste, tires and petroleum coke.

"The long-term goal of this research is to enhance electronic commerce (e-commerce), which is presently operating under its expected capacity. I approach this challenge by: (i) designing an effective trust management system; (ii) developing an intelligent recommendation system; and (iii) constructing a feasible architecture for mobile e-commerce.

    One main reason why e-commerce has not yet realized its full potential is that traders find it very difficult to trust one another online. It is, therefore, important to have a trust management system that can effectively assist e-commerce traders to make good trust decisions. I will consider the social, psychological, and computational approaches to analyze the trust decision making process, identify the components involved in trust and study how these components interact with one another in order to construct a useful trust management system.

    Encouraging consumers to participate more actively in online shopping is a valid way to boost e-commerce. This can be achieved by developing intelligent recommendation systems that help consumers make their best purchase decisions. I would like to explore suitable techniques from artificial intelligence, data mining and  information retrieval to develop a system that can intelligently analyze several sources of appropriate information available online (e.g., ratings, comments and reviews of users and experts, websites of vendors, etc.) to suggest the most suitable products and vendors to consumers. The proposed system should also provide consumers with good justification for its recommendations.

    Mobilizing online trading is also a promising direction to improve e-commerce. I plan to construct a feasible architecture for mobile e-commerce that would allow users (both consumers and vendors) of mobile devices, such as PDAs or mobile phones, to conduct business anytime and anywhere. This architecture would enable inter-operability among different e-marketplaces, while taking into consideration the inherent difficulties (e.g., security issues, etc.) as well as the limitations of mobile devices (e.g., expensive connection costs, etc.).

"In recent years, several studies have emphasized the unprecedented growth in security threats from multiple and varied sources. Traditional protection mechanisms such as access control or firewalls, although valuable, have shown their limits in dealing with these threats. In this context most organizations put a particular emphasis on network forensics, which consists of investigating hacking incidents, allowing them to assess the impact of a penetration and take appropriate measures to ensure secure service continuity, and prevent future similar incidents. However, investigating computer attacks is a challenging task that usually requires analyzing a mass of diverse data. Few organizations are well equipped to tackle this challenge mainly because there are few tools accessible to organizations that will help determine the impact of hacking incidents. An important but extremely difficult aspect of network forensics is attacker profiling. This consists of maintaining and using information about the attacker himself, for instance, by identifying his operating system through passive OS fingerprinting. We propose in this project a new approach to user profiling that is based on multimodal biometrics technology for passive and dynamic user monitoring in computer networks. The proposed technology combines an enhanced form of keystroke technology and a new biometrics technology based on mouse dynamics. Our enhancement to keystroke technology consists of allowing free text detection, meaning that the user is detected dynamically based on arbitrary text inputs. Mouse dynamics biometrics involves a signature that is based on selected mouse movement characteristics, which are computed using statistical techniques such as neural networks. By allowing dynamic and passive user monitoring, the proposed technology can be used to track reliably and continuously legitimate and illegitimate users throughout computing sessions. The profiles computed in this case are more accurate since they are based on distinctive biological characteristics of users. The computed biometrics profile can be used to track an attacker throughout computing sessions, allowing identifying, easily and accurately, compromised systems within the environment. In this project, we investigate besides network forensics, many other applications of the proposed multimodal biometric technique including session security, intrusion detection, electronic signature, and multifactor authentication.

"In today's globally expanding business world, protecting the identity and transactions of online consumers is crucial for any company to reach out for new market. This directs digital information technologies towards the

adoption of stronger and more secure authentication schemes. Traditional password scheme is notoriously flawed. Alternatives or complements to password scheme are hardware-based authentication devices, whose widespread adoption has been hindered by their high costs and complexities as well as customers reluctance to use such devices. Therefore, the development of cost-effective and low-impact mechanisms that strengthen online authentication without the need for hardware-based authentication devices becomes an imperative.

Risk-based authentication is an emerging approach for online authentication that fits this category of authentication technologies. Risk-based authentication consists of extracting and analyzing both contextual and historical user information, as well as data generated during Internet communications, to assess the probability a user interaction is authentic. Unfortunately, despite their high convenience and low cost, existing risk-based authentication technologies are plagued by their relatively high false positives and false negatives rates. This is rooted in the fact that existing risk-based authentication models are built on rule engines that use a combination of parameters such as IP address and location to create patterns to compare with those in future authorization attempts.

Rule-based (RB) techniques, however, are operationally ineffective due to the rapidly evolving nature of online fraud patterns  and the strong variability characterizing human behavior. Such cases cannot be completely covered by static rules from a rule base system. The purpose of this research is to investigate new risk-based authentication approach and mechanims that exhibit automatic pattern recognition and self-learning capabilities, in order to effectively and efficiently find new patterns to prevent fraud.

"Machines that learn from examples have long been a dream of computer scientists, and new generations of such machines are becoming increasingly versatile. For example, when properly trained, such machines can sometimes classify medical data much faster and with better accuracy than domain experts. However, many researchers applying these techniques need to know what the machines learned or which facts were taken into account when making the decisions.

"Communication protocols enable several computers to interact with each other.  Safety critical applications of these protocols, such as those governing the communications of embeded components in aircraft, demand an exceptionally high degree of confidence in their performance under all input conditions.  Automated reasoning tools, such as model checkers, can perform this analysis and, if a protocol under study is found to have a bug, report on the exact nature and cause of the bug in order to help redesign the protocol.  This type of reasoning requires that the protocols be expressed in a mathematically precise formalism that lends itself to automated reasoning.  Further, the anlysis can be carried out only when the protocol description is of a managable size. This project will develop visual, straightforward notations for describing the behavior of communications protocols.  Visual notations that are both precise and intuitive will help developers in modeling and analyzing the protocols under study. Due to the enormous size of the protocols, automated reasoners are needed to help designers manage the complexities inherent in their analysis. Based on these visual notations, automated reasoning tools, such as model checkers, will be developed to analyze next generation communication protocols. Ultimately, these tools will help deliver service guarantees for the essential communications tools such as phone systems and the Internet, that we use every day.



While my work is based in the world of communication protocols, the algorithms and concepts that are being developed will, it is hoped, have wider application in software engineering generally, as we come to require more and more stringent reliability from computer systems.

"Previous NSERC funding has enabled me to document the precocious music perception skills of infants. Infants notice most of the subtleties of music that adults notice. However, they sometimes surprise us by noticing subtleties in pitch and rhythm that adults fail to notice. The overall goal of the proposed research is to explore perceptual and learning biases in early life and their consequences for music and speech perception and memory. In the next grant period, I plan to examine four principal questions. The first is the relative ease with which listeners of different ages overcome inherent or acquired perceptual biases. Biases against dissonant music have prevented 20th and 21st century atonal compositions from achieving widespread popularity. Surprisingly, infants exhibit comparable biases. We plan to test 6-month-olds, 12-month-olds and adults on their detection of subtle pitch changes in the context of atonal (dissonant) music. We will also determine whether exposure to atonal music can improve 12-month-olds' and adults' perception of its pitch patterning. The second question involves memory for sound patterns. Music and speech are so engaging for young listeners that their memory for specific musical pieces and voices is often enduring. In one experiment, I plan to examine infants' memory for music and voices from videos that they watched at home. The third question concerns children who were born deaf but learned to ""hear"" through auditory prostheses known as cochlear implants. I plan to assess their ability to match voices and music from their favorite television programs with images from those programs. The fourth question concerns childhood bilingualism. There are many advantages to bilingualism, cognitive as well as social. I will examine whether there are minor perceptual costs to bilingualism in the early years. Specifically, I will compare bilingual children's ability to decipher degraded speech (i.e., speech with many pitch cues removed) to that of monolingual children. The proposed program of research is expected to increase our understanding of the course of auditory development in typical and atypical populations of infants and children.

"Arctic tundra and boreal forest environments account for a large proportion of Canada's land surface and are important systems within the context of global climate change research. These northern environments are thought to be particularly sensitive to changes in climate, yet it remains unclear as to how these environments will respond. It is expected that any alterations in arctic tundra and boreal forest ecosystem function associated with increased temperatures will be expressed through shifts in plant phenology (i.e., vegetation growth patterns with season), species composition, and abundance. Remote sensing provides a means for monitoring these shifts, with the potential to characterize biophysical variables that control carbon fluxes over landscapes or regions.

  Our research focuses on the estimation and mapping of biophysical variables for northern terrestrial landscapes traversing tundra and boreal forest ecosystems. Vegetation strata in tundra environments are not well defined and the vertical component is limited. Hence, vegetation indices derived from spectral data from satellites may provide accurate estimates of biophysical variables for arctic ecosystems. However, we need to develop methods that are sensitive to variable chlorophyll content, exposed soil/gravel tills, and variable moisture regimes, all of which affect plant communities, biomass accumulation, biodiversity and productivity.

   Estimating biophysical variables for forested ecosystems represents a three-dimensional problem since structural components of a forest ecosystem are distributed vertically as well as horizontally. Lidar (light detection and ranging) remote sensing captures three-dimensional information on forest structure (e.g., tree and canopy height) and provides significant potential for volume and aboveground biomass estimation using forest allometry (e.g., the relationship of tree height to other structural variables such as tree volume and biomass). Analysis of lidar height metrics is being conducted to determine how three-dimensional surfaces of the forest canopy and terrain can be created and utilized to predict the structural (and functional) nature of forst stands.","Remote sensing of environmental change across northern terrestrial ecosystems",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Remote sensing"

"The ""Generation IV"" CANDU Supercritical Water-Cooled reactor (""SCWR"") is a conceptual design for a would produce super-critical water at temperatures as high as 625Â°C to generate electricity, hydrogen and district heating. The use of super-critical water to carry heat from the reactor core to the turbine will generate much more extreme water chemistry conditions than those found in the current CANDU-PHW design, which operates from 250 to 320Â°C. The long term viability of the Gen IV CANDU-SCWR concept depends on the ability of designers to predict and control water chemistry, in order to minimize radionuclide transport and subtle corrosion effects. The region of most importance is the range from 275 to 450 Â°C and 25 MPa, the so-called ""pseudo transition zone"" which includes sub-critical and supercritical aqueous solutions at liquid-like densities. This is a frontier region of hydrothermal chemistry, both because the SCWR would require a unique

water chemistry, not previously seen in the primary coolant circuits of pressure-tube reactors, and because most quantitative studies of aqueous solutes do not extend above 300 Â°C. This proposal seeks funding for a collaborative project that will use state-of-the-art instruments to determine ionization and association constants for simple acids, bases, dissolved metals, and organic complexes under near-critical and super-critical conditions that will be encountered in the SCWR. The instrumental methods include Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy, calorimetry, visualization, and modelling techniques. These are extremely specialized pieces of high-precision equipment, with capabilities shared by few other laboratories in North America. The project includes the construction of high-pressure cells and calibration of the equipment for operation in the supercritical region, measurements on several acids, bases and salts relevant to Gen IV steam generator chemistry, and the development of equations to predict the behaviour of aqueous species under these extreme conditions.","Aqueous chemistry and phase behaviour under generation IV supercritical water reactor conditions","Nuclear energy",CANADA,CANADA,"Physical chemistry"
"CANDU nuclear reactors are a uniquely Canadian technology in that their design is based on the use of heavy water in a closed loop to transfer heat from the reactor core to the steam generator. The pH of the heavy water in this ""primary coolant system"" is tightly controlled to minimize the effects of corrosion and radioactive transport. Optimizing primary coolant chemistry requires detailled models for the chemical behaviour of metal oxides, dissolved gases and pH-control additives at temperatures as high as 300 ï¿½C, using data determined in light water systems. The methods now used to correct these models for the differences between light-water and heavy-water systems are based entirely on room temperature studies. This proposal is for the second phase of a definitive laboratory study to provide fundamental data and understanding for the difference in ionization constants between H2O and D2O, for simple acids and bases at the extreme temperatures and pressures encountered in nuclear reactors (250 to 300 ï¿½C and 10 MPa). The first phase developed high precision AC conductance, densimetry, and UV-visible methods to measure the deuterium isotope effect on acid-base ionization. These state-of-the-art instruments, constructed of inert materials to withstand the corrosive conditions that exist in high temperature water, allow us to measure differences in the chemical equilibrium constants in H2O and D2O under identical conditions, directly.  The second phase will use these instruments, and a new custom-made Raman spectrometry system, to measure data for a number of model systems and to develop an improved, practical model for estimating the magnitude of D2O isotope effects on metal hydrolysis and metal oxide solubility, under CANDU operating conditions. The project will contribute to research aimed at extending the lifetime of existing reactors by providing criteria for optimizing primary circuit pH to reduce feeder tube thinning. It will make a long term contribution to Canada's leadership role in heavy water technology by providing a fundamental understanding of D2O isotope effects on chemical equilibria under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure.","D2O Isotope Effects on Ionization, Transition Metal Hydrolysis and Solubilitty Under CANDU-6 Coolant Condition","Nuclear energy",CANADA,CANADA,"Physical chemistry"

"Waste oils obtained from frying and rendering activities are promising sources of lipids for the production of biodiesel. However, in order to upgrade these wastes to high quality fuels, significant technological challenges must be overcome. Issues of feedstock contamination and variability must be addressed in processing waste lipids to provide a consistent product that can be added to diesel fuel. There is also an urgent need for an inherently reliable processing technology that can achieve the new tighter North American biodiesel standards. Consultation with Canadian biodiesel producers has revealed that new standards on biodiesel purity are imposing greater constraints on the processing of waste feedstocks. A biodiesel membrane reactor recently developed at the University of Ottawa offers an inherently reliable processing technology to meet these challenges. The novel feature of this continuous membrane reactor is its ability to simultaneously transform lipid feedstock into biodiesel and separate the reaction products from the feedstock. Early tests point to the ability of the membrane reactor to retain soaps during the base esterification of oils containing high free fatty acids. The reactor has been tested with food-grade canola oil, but remains largely untested using waste oils such as yellow grease (used frying oils). We propose to determine the critical flux of the membranes used in the membrane reactor. Using various grades of yellow grease feedstock, we will produce biodiesel meeting the new standards. The project aims at developing technology to reduce mono and divalent salts in biodiesel produced from waste oils using diafiltration and various ion-exchange resins. The effect of membrane pore size on free fatty acids and soap retention in the membrane reactor, the coking properties and the distillation temperatures of the biodiesel produced will be determined.","Production of high quality biodiesel from waste feedstocks","Energy storage and conversion",CANADA,CANADA,"Other sources of energy (solar, wind, etc.)"
"Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that offers proven net green house gas reductions. The life cycle analysis of biodiesel indicates that 3.2 units of energy can be obtained for every unit of energy input in its production.  This is the highest energy yield of all liquid transportation fuels; well above petrodiesel and gasoline. However, biodiesel is not a distillate which seriously affects its quality. It is the objective of this work to significantly improve biodiesel quality and stability by the use of a novel membrane reactor developed in our laboratories. In addition to this, the possibility of capturing oleochemicals by this new technology will be determined. Membrane reactor technology offers significant potential in recuperating valuable oleophilic substances found in raw seed oils. The rapidly expanding biodiesel industry offers an untapped source of oleochemicals, such as natural vitamins and oleophilic substances found in these oils. Present biodiesel processing technology cannot capture these substances.  Their capture will offset the cost of raw feedstocks; reducing the cost of biodiesel while increasing its purity.  The influence of these compounds on the stability of biodiesel will be investigated. It is proposed in this work to transesterify a number of raw seed oils; isolate and identify the unsaponifiable substances retained in the membrane reactor and study their effect on fuel stability.  It is the first time that such a process stream is available. The recuperation of these oleochemicals, as a result of our newly developed membrane reactor, is of great interest given the unique combination of reaction and separation occurring in the reactor and the potential quantities of unsaponifiable material available in the production of biodiesel. The environmental footprint of existing biodiesel plants will be reduced in a second project aimed at removing glycerol prior to water washing or adsorption in conventional processes. Both projects will enhance the commercial acceptance of higher blends of biodiesel by improving its purity and stability; realizing the full green house gas mitigation potential of this excellent renewable fuel.

"Recently, the identification of SUMOylation, the process by which SUMO, a small ubiquitin-like modifier, is covalently linked to target proteins, has emerged as a new protein modification that regulates the function of an increasing number of transcription factors. The functional consequences of SUMOylation are not understood at the molecular level, but with recent observations that nuclear receptors were reported to be SUMOylated, this raises the interesting possibility that SUMOylation may serve as a novel mechanism by which hormonal signaling pathways may regulate transcription.



Our expertise in the study of nuclear receptors has mainly arise from our work on estrogen receptors ERa and ERb. With the identification of ERb, our reevaluation of ER activation pathways has allowed to recognize that ERa and ERb are selectively regulated by growth factors of the EGF family which direct ER phosphorylation, therefore providing a potential of ERs to undergo posttranslational modifications. These studies therefore uncover novel aspects on how non hormonal mediated pathways may regulate transcription by estrogen receptors.



With the emerging evidence that SUMOylation represents a novel mechanism in ER functions that has not received widespread attention, and based on the rising concept that phosphorylation and SUMOylation are intimately associated to regulate transcription factors, these studies aim at defining a functional coupling between these two multisite posttranslational modifications of estrogen receptors to integrate their transcriptional competence and cellular functions.

"Much of modern technology owes to our deep understanding of electronic properties of materials.  That understanding is rooted in intertwined empirical, experimental and theoretical knowledge. I work on the theoretical aspects of electronic properties of materials, in other word I design and solve mathematical models and perform large scale computer simulations to understand new materials that escape conventional understanding. In materials such as high temperature superconductors, contrary to the usual case, the electrons interact so strongly with each other that they would in fact prefer not to carry electricity; they should be in an insulating state.  It is by changing slightly the number of electrons by chemical means that one is lead to a new type of superconductivity that occurs at much higher temperature than usual. In the last few years several breakthroughs have occurred, in terms of new materials, new theoretical understanding and new spectacular experiments. We contributed to some of the theoretical breakthroughs. We believe that we are in a position to answer questions such as: What are the appropriate mathematical tools to predict the behavior of electronic systems that show both localized (magnetic) and propagating (superconducting) character? Can we use these tools to show that there are new elementary excitations, or concepts (pseudogap) that could summarize and explain in a simple way the anomalous properties of these systems (i.e. find concepts that will do what the concept of ""holes"" did for the semiconductor industry)? Can we also use these concepts in related classes of materials?  What is the origin of high temperature superconductivity? Answering such questions should help people in my field to develop materials that may have other striking and technologically useful magnetic or electrical properties and also exhibit new phases of matter. Answering such questions will also help in the quest for materials that could exhibit superconductivity at room temperature. Since superconductivity manifests quantum properties on a macroscopic scale, one can foresee in the long run the birth of revolutionary technologies, such as the quantum computer, and corresponding new industries.","Thï¿½orie et simulations par ordinateur des matï¿½riaux quantiques et de la supraconductivitï¿½/ Theory and computer simulations of quantum materials and superconductivity","Physical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Electronic properties of solids"

"The Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) is expected to become navigable in the near future. Current estimates are based on simulation results from General Circulation Models (GCMs). The spatial resolution of GCMs, however, only allows for a coarse representation of the CAA. Higher resolution models are needed to better predict the future evolution of the sea ice in the CAA. Until now, sea-ice dynamic models have been calibrated against buoy drift data in the Arctic Ocean from the International Arctic Buoy Program (IABP), but no data is present for the CAA in IABP. Whether the calibration of these models (and the continuum assumption upon which they are based), are still valid at high resolution remain an open question.  To address this, we make in-situ measurements within the narrow passages of the CAA. In particular, we monitor the temporal evolution of sea-ice deformations, internal stresses and thicknesses in the CAA.  These measurements are used to calibrate/validate a high resolution sea-ice model that was recently developed in our group. The dynamical part of this model is solved using the Generalized Minimum Residual method (GMRES), with a line Successive Over-Relaxation preconditioner to allow for efficient long term integrations. This new implementation constitutes a significant improvement in numerical efficiency and allows for the integration of the model at high resolution over a domain including both the CAA and the Arctic Ocean. The first deployment took place successfully last October (2007) north of the M'Clintock Channel using ArcticNet logistics aboard the Amundsen ice breaker.

"The year 2007 marked a record low in summer sea-ice extent in the Arctic, with 20\% less ice than the previous all-time record minimum of 2005, an area larger than Ontario. This is part of a long-term trend of more than 8\% ice extent decline per decade since the late seventies. Analysis of simulation results from a Global Climate Model by the PI and colleagues, participating in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), show that the Arctic could be free of ice around the years 2040, and that the transition to a summer ice-free Arctic could happen rapidly, i.e., over the course of a few years. Sixty percent of all global climate models in IPCC also show abrupt transitions to an ice-free Arctic. While they mostly show abrupt transitions, all these models still underestimate the decline in sea-ice extent as compared to satellite record (1979 -2006). Indeed, many of the relevant processes to the observed sea-ice decline occur on small spatial scales - not resolved in current climate models. The main goal of the proposed research program is to develop a high resolution ice-ocean model 1- to improve prediction of future sea ice conditions in both the Arctic and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), and 2- to use this model to study the response of high latitude ecosystems to changing climate conditions. This research program will build directly on existing field initiatives in which the PI is involved, i.e., the Nansen Amundsen Basin Observing System, the Canadian Basin Observing System, and the Canadian Arctic Buoy Program (led by the PI). This work will provide an improved understanding of the timeline for ice-free conditions in Canadian Waters. This will also place Canada in a unique position to better assess the changing Arctic and how it can affect local marine ecosystem, economic development of the Canadian Arctic, and the well-being of local Inuit populations, whose lifestyle is intimately linked with the presence of ice, e.g. fishing, hunting and transportation.

"The electroretinogram (ERG) is an old clinical investigation tool developed in the 1950's that has recently regained momentum in basic and clinical sciences as an adjunct exploratory tool to genetically modified animal models. It is a complex composite evoked biopotential elicited at the level of the retina by a visual stimulus. We thus propose to study the interplay of the complex retinal generators after specific neuronal circuits have been pharmacologically dissociated, in several animal species commonly used in research and for different modalities of ERGs.  This will be the basis of the development of ERG model for the swine, guinea pig and the rat, which all have different ERG characteristics more of less similar to human ones.  Furthermore, we will study how the changes in the ERG signal translate into modifications of the retinal output (spike trains characteristics of retinal ganglion cells).  We also propose to study the impact of anesthesia on the neural processing with the retina as the model, as this is a very neglected field of research that has a major impact on our interpretation of animal results.  Finally, we want to quantify the waveform of the ERG signal by wavelet analysis, as we believe this contains useful information not detected by looking at the traditional amplitude and implicit time parameters.  The research program proposed will take place in a rich multidisciplinary environment and will offer training opportunities that will link clinical and basic sciences.

"Testicular Leydig cells are the main testosterone-producing cells in the male. These cells are indispensable for the proper development of external male genitalia, sex accessory glands, increased muscle mass, as well as production of mature sperm. Leydig cell function is tightly controlled by the pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH). LH binds to its receptor located on the surface of Leydig cells thus triggering activation of the several intracellular signaling pathways (the main one being the cAMP) leading to increased gene expression and steroidogenesis. The transcription factors downstream of these signaling pathways and their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Therefore, the goal of the present research program is to

identify these factors and to determine their mechanism of action. One family of transcription factors that I believe plays an important role in this process is the NUR77 group of orphan nuclear receptors. Consistent with my hypothesis, we have shown that these factors are regulators of steroidogenic gene expression. In addition, we are also studying how Nur77 activate expression of these genes (through protein-protein interactions). We have also begun analyzing how NUR77 expression at the transcriptional (Nur77 promoter, signaling pathways and transcription factors involved) and post-translational (phosphorylation, intracellular trafficking) levels is regulated in response to the various stimuli. Thus, different but complementary state-of-the-art molecular and cellular biology approaches are routinely used to elucidate the roles played by this particular family of transcriptional regulators in LH-induced gonadal steroidogenesis.

En contrepartie, d'autres sont en augmentation et atteignent des niveaux de populations qui dï¿½passent les limites de variabilitï¿½ historiques.

"It is impossible to naturally react to our environment without voluntarily contracting or inhibiting a muscle. Also, making a decision on how to act or react can benefit from the integration of the multiple senses. Interestingly, it is possible that our limb movements could quickly influence how the multiple senses are integrated. As such, the proposed research is designed to determine the influence of voluntary action on the relative contribution/weighing of different senses (i.e., eyes, inner ear - balance sense, and muscle & tendon receptors). More specifically, the research program is designed to assess how the brain uses signals from the various sensory receptors as a function of the ongoing characteristics of the limb trajectory.

"The theory of pseudoanalytic functions, developed independently by L. Bers and I. N. Vekua, became one of the important impulses for developing the general theory of elliptic systems. Roughly speaking, these functions are solutions of generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations



     Among other results, Bers obtained analogues of the Taylor series for pseudoanalytic functions. The long term goal of this research program is to find and evaluate solutions of some differential equations in terms of the Bers' theory of Taylor series for pseudoanalytic functions. This means to construct an infinite system of exact solutions explicitly. The first class of differential equation considered will be two-dimensional, but we also intent to consider the multidimensional cases. The other long term goal, tied to the first one, is to develop Bers theory for the bicomplex pseudoanalytic functions theory. This will allow us to find solutions of differential equations containing complex-valued functions. Finally, since the procedure is algorithmically simple, we intent to implement the procedure with the aid of a computer system of symbolic or numerical calculation.



     This research program has several applications in such areas as quantum mechanics, elastic scattering between composite systems (e.g. ions, atoms and molecules), electromagnetic wave propagation in disordered media, acoustic, helioseismology, fluid mechanics, geophysical prospecting as well as in medical imaging for the electrical impedance tomography.

"This is a research equipment grant application for purchasing a high precision infrared camera for measuring and analyzing the thermal power losses in power electronic converters and integrated circuits. While the overall system efficiency of a power converter can be very accurately measured using conventional lab equipment, it is nearly impossible to measure the individual losses in the system components through electrical measurements. The IR camera is an extremely versatile tool that can be used to measure the power losses in a wide variety of systems by correlating the spacial temperature distribution with power losses using thermal models. The high-precision thermal data will be used to validate the benefit of the proposed efficiency optimization techniques in a variety of projects, including (1) low-power integrated miniature dc-dc converters, (2) power converters for high-efficiency LED lighting, (3) battery management circuitry for electric vehicles and (4) distributed power electronic converters for photovoltaic applications. The detailed experimental data generated from the IR camera will greatly enhance the accuracy, credibility and technical merit of the publications targeted by the research program. The portable nature of the equipment makes it convenient for sharing with other researchers beyond the four co-applicants of this grant. The IR camera will be extensively used to train both graduate and undergraduate students in thermal design and characterization in the mentioned projects, with an expected usage of 60 hours/month. This training is highly relevant when most power electronics and semiconductor companies are seeking engineers with a sound understanding of thermal constraints and design issues.

"In recent years, as the microelectronics industry struggles to stay on the path of exponential growth projected by Moore's law, energy efficiency and power-management have taken center stage. Switched-mode power supplies (SMPS) are the key enabling technology for efficiently delivering the tightly regulated supply voltages required by today's modern mixed-signal (digital+analog) integrated circuits (ICs). The SMPS acts as the interface between the energy source, such as a battery, and the load ICs. A typical SMPS uses a combination of high-quality semiconductor switches, energy storage components, sensors and control circuits to regulate one or more output voltages in the presence of disturbances. State-of-the-art SMPS have a power conversion efficiency above 90%. The resulting low heat dissipation allows multiple SMPS to be integrated with their load circuits into a single IC. The clear trend in SMPS research is toward digital control-loops, increased integration within system-on-chip (SoC) applications, higher efficiency over the full load-range and higher switching frequency, resulting in smaller energy storage components. The long-term goals of the proposed research are to make tomorrow's integrated power-supplies smarter, smaller, more efficient, more robust, and more reliable, while reducing electromagnetic interference (EMI) and environment impacts. This work will focus on high-voltage applications with particularly strict reliability standards, where system failure results in dire consequences to humans. These include automotive, aerospace, biomedical and industrial applications. In these applications, such as automotive control units for engine management or airbags, multiple power-supplies operate in harsh environmental conditions that push the limits of silicon technology. Accordingly, specialized high-voltage technologies and circuits are needed to develop tomorrow's automotive SoCs. The short-term research will be focused on circuit-level power-stage efficiency optimization, advanced packaging and hybrid-integration technologies, as well as system-level innovations.

"A prototypical question of arithmetical geometry is the following: find all rational solutions to a cubic equation like y^2+y=x^3-x, i.e. all fractions x and y which when plugged into the equation make the two sides equal.  The restriction to rational solutions explains the 'arithmetical' in the name of the discipline; the 'geometry' becomes apparent when we plot all the possible real solutions to the equation, and discover that they trace out a plane curve called an 'elliptic curve' (confusingly, it is not an ellipse!).  One might object to considering only equations of degree 3, but in fact it is there that we find the most interesting phenomena.  On the geometric side, cubics alone among all curves have a geometrically defined way of 'adding' two points on the curve to produce a third.  On the arithmetical side, cubics are the only equations for which we can't a priori say whether they have a finite or an infinite number of rational solutions; both in fact occur.  A fundamental theorem, due to Mordell and Weil, asserts that all the solutions can be generated from a finite list by applying the geometrically defined addition.  In practice, the theorem allows us to find all solutions to a cubic equation after a finite search; but in theory, the search could go on forever, and is not the most efficient method anyway.  It is therefore of interest to look for a method of finding the solutions directly, by adding up an infinite sum.



The only such method proven to work has essentially been known for over a century: Heegner points have coordinates with especially simple symmetries, and thus present a solution to a special case of the 12th of the problems posed as challenges and guidelines to 20th century mathematics by the great D. Hilbert.  In my recent work, I conjecture an analogous construction for curves whose coefficients lie in imaginary quadratic fields.  The extensive numerical testing of the conjecture has informed my research program, whose goal is to understand the theoretical underpinings of my conjecture, and to improve the rather limited present state of understanding of elliptic curves over imaginary quadratic fields.

"Human cells express thousands of proteins, which make up their structure and carry out all of their regulatory functions.  The activities of these proteins are coordinated by various mechanisms, including the reversible addition of a phosphate group to one of the amino acid building blocks of which they're composed.  Over one-third of all cellular proteins are believed to be controlled in this way, and their so-called ""phospho-states"" are mediated by the competing activities of enzymes termed protein kinases (add phosphates) and protein phosphatases (remove phosphates).  Phosphorylation events are found in nearly all signaling pathways within the cell, and thus it is critical to understand the enzymes that control them.



My laboratory's research is aimed at characterizing the specific targeting of protein phosphatases within living human cells. To accomplish this, we have developed a powerful ""what you see is what you get"" approach, in which phosphatases are tagged with fluorescent reporter molecules so that they can be followed throughout the cell using a fluorescence microscope.  This same fluorescent tag can then be used to pull the phosphatase complexes out of the cells and identify all of the proteins with which they interact at any given time and in any given place with the cell.  In addition to dissecting the diverse cellular pathways that they regulate, this research will also increase our understanding of the mechanisms that are in place to allow dynamic targeting of these regulatory proteins throughout the cell cycle and in response to cellular perturbations.

"Regulating users' accesses to resources, access control, is one of the most important aspects of security. The administration of large access control systems is challenging, and centralized approaches do not scale. Decentralized approaches introduce the risk that security policies are violated. A resolution to this is to complement access control with policy verification that tells a trusted administrator the consequences (e.g., related to safety, availability and mutual exclusion) of leaving the system in a particular state. I will address foundational and applied problems that stand in the way of realizing policy verification subsystems for access control. The proposed work will provide research and educational training to students on one of the most important aspects of information security. Information systems in Canada will benefit from the new technology that is developed that will make access control scalable, robust and usable.



I will resolve the exact complexity class to which several pertinent policy verification problems in access control belong. I will innovatively apply techniques such as model checking for problems that are intractable. I will show what particular approach to model checking (e.g., bounded versus symbolic) is the best approach. To do this empirically, I will build a test suite based on data we have about realistic access control deployments and make it available to others. I will present new designs for hybrid access control schemes such as those that combine Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC). I will present new criteria based on soundness and precision for such designs that have broad applicability to the design of access control schemes. I will invent new, comprehensive approaches for comparing the expressive power of access control schemes that address deficiencies in current approaches and leverage recent research advances. I will build prototypes of policy verification subsystems that address the issues of software-layering and usability. The prototypes will demonstrate the scalability, robustness and usability advantages we gain.

"Our research will address the following methodological areas: 

1) Constructing network models based on experimental procedures. The procedures we address perturb a variable or variables in a steady-state system and monitor the effect on the system. We have shown that existing differential equation based procedures can be cast as simultaneous equation models from econometric 

theory. The work will expand the technology of perturbation experiments, and develop a theory of experimental design for such experiments. 

2) Methods relating two or more types of high-dimensional data. We have been working on methods for sparse singular value decomposition, which enable high-dimensional canonical correlation analysis relating two different types of data, such as gene expression and SNP genotype. We will develop these methods, stressing computation, interpretation, and ""oracle properties"" ( abilility to select the correct variables in a sparse model). This will provide exploratory methods for identifying complex relationships between two classes of variables. 

3) Prediction based on high-dimensional data. We have been exploring the identification of clusters of variables which are both correlated within cluster and predictive of an outcome variable. We will develop a prediction method incorporating an original supervised clustering algorithm, our current work on filtering variables prior tocluster analysis, and our work on cluster number. This will apply to important applications such as medical diagnosis or prognosis. 

4) Cluster analysis for high-dimensional data. We will expoit our current work on sparse singular value decomposition to define clusters based on a collection of sparse eigenvectors. We will extend our methods to two-way clustering, where clusters of variables are defined forsubsets of individuals.

"Static bioenergetic models calculate the energy requirements of an individual or population as a function of age. Currently, the best bioenergetic model for marine mammals is a static model constructed for Steller sea lions (Winship et al. 2002; Winship and Trites 2003). This model will be refined and expanded to predict food requirements of key species of marine mammals in Canada and Alaska (walruses, harbour seals, fur seals, Steller sea lions, killer whales and beluga whales) using published records from wild and captive animals. Data required include diet, biological value of prey (digestibility and proximate composition), foraging costs (energy and time to find food), energy requirements (total and activity-specific), and body size at age estimates. These models will be used to estimate how food requirements for these species will change in response to changes in the prey base and physical environment (e.g., foraging cost, thermoregulation). The models will be further used to develop dynamic bioenergetic models that incorporate the physiological responses (potential range) to changes in animals' energy budgets. The dynamic models will incorporate functional responses that permit individual parameters to change in accordance with other changes in the system. Dynamic bioenergetic models are the most useful means of predicting the effects of changes in an animal's biotic (fish distribution) and abiotic (temperature, ice cover) environment on its behavior and physiology, and ultimately on parameters that impact population levels (survival, reproduction rates). They will be combined with habitat models that incorporate accessibility assumptions based on published age and sex specific constraints, as well as suitability assumptions that use a variety of physical variables (e.g., bathymetry, temperature, salinity, ice cover, haulout sites) to differentiate between regions of equal accessibility. Estimates of the food consumption and energy requirements of marine mammals, and the bioenergetic consequences of global warming on their range distributions have theoretical implications and practical applications for fisheries management.","Effects of climate change on the distribution and energy requirements of marine mammals","Modelling and mathematical simulation of natural processes",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal ecology"

"The main objectives of this project include the increase of the cost efficiency in making nano-structured binding systems for manufacturing refractory ceramics and the implementation of nano-technologies in making more environmentally friendly refractories for industrial non-ferrous smelting, converting and refining furnaces. These will be firstly addressed through fundamental research on using nano-powder oxide additives and geoplymer type binding systems to promote and enhance sintering at much lower temperatures than the current in-use technologies. The main avenue will be the use of chemical (non-combustion) instead of thermal (fossil based) energy to produce dense ceramics. Based on the fundamental research results, we will develop a new generation of low-temperature fired magnesia based bricks for non ferrous furnaces and magnesia and alumina based castables for all metals making industries. In order to achieve our objectives the following two topics will be pursued:  a) develop new nano-powder based binding systems for making refractory ceramics and b) develop cost effective and environmentally friendly brick and castable refractories. The objectives of this research and development project are in line with the Canadian commitment of reducing the green house emissions to the levels stipulated by the Kyoto Accord. We expect that upon completion of this project the Canadian refractory manufacturers will be able to gain or exchange ""carbon points"" with other countries, in the process of their contribution to reducing the CO2 emissions. By using the results of this research and development work, the amount of fossil combustibles could be reduced with as much as 40% for making Refractories and 40-60% for using Refractories by metal producers.","Process engineering of cost effective and environmentally friendly refractories through nano-technology","Primary metal products (ferrous and non-ferrous)",CANADA,CANADA,Ceramics

"Concern over the environmental effects of carbon dioxide emissions, arising from the combustion of

carbon-based fossil fuels to generate power, is driving research to reduce such emissions. This may be

achieved by improving the efficiency of high energy-consuming processes, together with the

development of alternate sources of energy. The comminution (breaking and crushing) of rocks in the

Canadian mineral processing industry consumes approximately 1.86% of the total national energy use.

Furthermore, it is widely recognized that comminution is an inherently inefficient process, with most of

the energy being released as low quality heat and only a small percentage actually contributing to the

particle fracture process. Accordingly, fundamental, studies are being undertaken to understand the

details of dynamic crack propagation and crack branching during particle fracture in order to ascertain

how modifications may be made to the comminution process to improve its overall energy efficiency.

Meanwhile, the development of an alternate source of energy such as nuclear power is overshadowed by

concerns over safety. In particular, the safe storage of radioactive nuclear wastes by ceramic

encapsulation and immobilization in deep underground repositories is a major cause of concern, because

it has to be immobilized for thousands of years before the radiation level has decayed to negligible

levels. Consequently, fundamental thermodynamic modeling studies are being conducted on stable

encapsulating ceramics, such as zircon (ZrSiO4), in order to estimate the extremely low rate of

dissolution of the ceramic encapsulation under a worst case scenario where groundwater may be present

in the repository.","Fundamental studies on dissolution and fracture of minerals","Mineral resources ( prospecting, exploration, mining, extraction, processing)",CANADA,CANADA,"Materials processing"
"Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Transfer (SVAT) models and climate models need to better predict the effects of climate change or land use change. To do so they must describe the lateral moisture fluxes and account for the spatial variability in soil moisture more realistically than at present because heterogeneity in plant available water can have a strong impact on the surface energy and water budgets. The objective of the proposed research is to obtain a systematic understanding of the 3D soil moisture dynamics and the environmental or site conditions controlling the development of spatial soil moisture patterns and spatial variability in lateral flow. Field experiments focusing on both the event and the inter-event time scales will be combined with modeling experiments. The field experiments will be conducted in the Malcolm Knapp Research Forest. The field measurements will follow a nested approach in order to include all landscape units and to be able to explore scale effects. Soil moisture will be measured manually throughout the soil profile at many locations and continuously at several locations. To determine the feedbacks between soil moisture and transpiration, sapflow will be measured with constant heat sapflow sensors. The 3D soil moisture patterns will be related to lateral flow patterns during precipitation events as the internal water table dynamics will be characterized as well. Tracer experiments in the wet and the dry season will support the determination of the spatial variability and occurrence of lateral subsurface flow. The data from these field experiments will be used to develop and validate a distributed water balance model, which will be used in a virtual experiment and scenario testing mode. The model will be used to determine under which environmental conditions specific soil moisture patterns form. In the future this new information will be incorporated in a decision tree approach to determine what type of spatial variability in soil moisture is likely to occur in an area and what would be an appropriate representation of the lateral water fluxes. This will lead to more site specific representations of lateral hydrological processes in SVAT models and better predictions of the effects of land use or climate change.

More particularly, all individual will develop a personal memory of nociception modulated by previous experiences of pain and possible nociceptive hypersensitization. We first hypothesized that pain response to the sensitization of the nociceptive system can be detected, elucidated and quantified, even in species not reputed to be highly expressive. Our second hypothesis is that an adequate management of pain will attenuate chronic hypersensitization and its morbid consequences; it will improve animal welfare and its impact on animal productivity. To test these two hypotheses, we propose a series of translational experimental approaches. On an experimental model of visceral pain in cows, we propose to validate behavioral and physiological pain assessment methods in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility, as well as to evaluate the impact of pain on dairy cattle productivity. We hypothesized, based on the data from a pilot study, that neurological conditions, including pain sensitization, will give rise to alterations of the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) proteome. We want to take advantage of our model in dairy cattle to largely explore the neuroproteomic biomarkers related to pain. Therefore, we would be apt to dress an exhaustive behavioral, physiological and proteomic profile of visceral pain in cows. We will apply this knowledge to study biological function of CSF nociceptive biomarkers in the mouse using transgenic models and to assess their potential value as diagnostic tools. This would open the door to new avenues in pain management with important consequences on animal welfare.

"There are two components of this proposal (1) distributed Verilog simulation (2) parallel particle  simulatlon. The proposed research on distributed Verilog simulation is a continuation of an existing project the goal of which is to  develop a scalable distributed gate level Verilog simulator for both distributed and shared memory platforms.  Our previous research has resulted in the development of a distributed Verilog simulation environment, DVS,  using Time Warp as the simulation engine and the open source Icarus Verilog as a front end.  We have developed a highly efficient gate level simulator, XTW, for a gate level simulator which makes use of a multi-level queueing mechanism.  We propose (1) developing a simulation environment which links Modelsim sequential simulators executing on individual  nodes together via Time Warp (2) porting XTW  to a shared  memory environment. We will try  to take advantage of shared memory for improved memory management. (3)  continuation of our work on module based load balancing. Preliminary results indicate that partitioning  based upon modules has benfited from the locality. We propose the development of efficient algorithms for  re-partitioining the circuit during the course of the simulation's execution (4) applying reinforcement learning  techniques to optimistic simulations.  Our  second research area focuses on the integration of continuous methods for the solution of pde's and discrete  event algorithms in the context of cosmological simulators.  We are  making use of a standard technique for the solution of interacting (cosmological) bodies-an oct tree solver for  Newtonian gravitational equations. Our goal is to incorporate colliding bodies into the picture by making use  of discrete event techniques. We have implemented a Time Warp engine and integrated it with the oct-tree  solver. The work is being done in conjunction with an astro-physics group from the University of Washington. Our first proposed task is the verification of the combined algorithms and an  evaluation of their scalability using realistic scenarios provided  by the astrophysicists.  We then intend to develop  partitioning algorithms.

"    )	Several bacterial pathogens are associated with food processing and can cause foods to become unsafe for human consumption. The proposed research program will use the significant foodborne pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), to investigate how the physiology of the organism affects survival, colonisation and persistence in the food processing environment. The long term objective of the research program is to come up with improved strategies for food preservation and sanitation based on a fundamental understanding of the stress response of Lm during and after exposure to adverse conditions associated with food processing. 

    )	In this research program, we will investigate factors influencing the attachment of Lm to cabbage and stainless steel surfaces under different temperature and nutritional conditions and the interactions between Lm and competing organisms reflecting conditions in the industry. Further characterization of an identified thermotolerant insertional Lm mutant is also proposed to determine the mechanisms behind this phenotypic trait. Also, our insertional mutant library (~ 4000 mutants in a food environmental Lm background) will be screened for mutants with attachment deficiencies to elucidate factors (genes) involved in the phenotypic characteristic. The location of the transposon interrupted gene will be identified in selected mutants followed by characterization of their phenotypes in comparison to the wild-type to determine the effect of the interrupted gene. Selected clinical and food Lm strains (and mutants) in the presence or absence of co-cultures will be compared in model experiments to determine their resistance to adverse conditions, ability to colonise surfaces and become cross-contaminated to foods and susceptibility to common cleaners and sanitisers.  Traditional culture methods, microscopy (electron, confocal, fluorescence and light) and transcriptional and proteomic analyses will be used to assess survival, injury, attachment and expression of specific genes. The novel information about factors involved in the survival and adaptation of Lm to conditions found in food products and the food processing environment can be used to devise new control strategies

Delivering information about a patient directly to a physician with handheld terminal at the patient bedside may improve the efficiency of healthcare and might reduce medical errors.  The physician's wireless handheld terminal will communicate with a wireless local-area network serving many such terminals.  There is the potential for electromagnetic interference between wireless sources and medical equipment such as heart monitors or infusion pumps, and the possibility of interference is increased when many wireless devices are operated in a hospital.  In this project methods will be developed for ensuring that the risk of interference between wireless sources and medical devices is very small.  Methods will be developed to assess the net electric field strength due to many wireless devices at the location of a medical device, and to evaluate how that field strength varies throughout a typical work shift. The risk that the field strength will exceed that tolerated by typical medical devices will be estimated.  Strategies will be developed for implementing the wireless local-area network such that risk of interference is negligibly small, allowing wireless informatics to be used freely in hospitals.

"We propose to investigate computational and mathematical methods in medical imaging. The research is driven by applications from nuclear medicine, in particular SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography), although many of our results have applications to other image modalities such as PET and MRI. Our main mathematical interest lies in dynamic SPECT imaging. In static imaging, one single image is reconstructed from the data obtained during a patient scan; in the dynamic case, the same data are used to reconstruct a sequence of 3-D images (i.e., a 3D movie) to show the dynamic behaviour of uptake and wash-out of substances, indicating to the physician functional information about the organs. This is an ill-posed inverse problem, with the challenge of not having enough data to determine the unknowns. Hence, additional information must be incorporated into the solution algorithms to exclude possible solutions which are not physically meaningful. Our approaches are either of a stochastic nature (Kalman filter) or will be based on large scale constrained optimization methods.

A second part of our research program is concerned with several topics arising in the numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations coming from many fields of scientific research and modeling.  Particular areas are high-order methods and the use of adaptivity to find solutions accurately and in a robust and efficient manner.

"Cells are composed of protein signaling networks that perform biological functions such as regulating cell growth or catalyzing biochemical reactions.  As a result, the malfunction of proteins often causes human illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, heart disease and cancer.  My long term research goal is to create synthetic protein signaling networks that will allow us to one day manipulate cell biology with the same precision as electrical circuits and computer networks.  To accomplish this goal, my proposal will focus on developing computational tools for studying protein sequences, structures and signaling networks.  First, to infer the function of a protein sequence, the Smith Waterman (SW) algorithm is used to find its similarity to proteins of known function.  As sequence databases grow larger, faster sequence comparison approaches are required such as using accelerated field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware.  To make the FPGA solution more affordable, I will develop FPGA hardware for accelerating the SW algorithm using fewer resources while maintaining a comparable speed.  Next, to study the protein signaling kinetics within cells, fluorescent protein biosensors are powerful tools but the design of these biosensors is often trial and error.  Using a computational tool to model the conformational space of protein biosensors, I improved the design however the tool was not quantitative.  To address that problem, I will include molecular factors that select preferred biosensor conformations.  Lastly, to design synthetic protein networks or model larger existing networks, I will develop a computational tool for simulating the spatial and temporal kinetics of protein signaling networks.  Together this work will yield insights into protein sequences and their networks that will ultimately aid in developing therapies for human illnesses.","Development of computational tools for studying protein sequences, structures and signaling networks","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Modelling and simulation studies"
"The recent proliferation of mobile and ubiquitous computing technologies (such as global positioning systems (GPS), radio frequency identification systems (RFID), and closed circuit television (CCTV)) has enabled the exploration of context-aware services which monitor and adapt to users, and provide them with useful services while they perform daily activities. The majority of existing research in context-aware computing has focused on three main areas: the construction of novel applications; the construction of new techniques and tools for sensing and inferring context and higher level activities; and the construction of software infrastructures to facilitate the development of this class of applications. Despite extensive investigations, research in this space has produced 1) a modest number of stand-alone applications which cannot interoperate with one another and 2) a set of techniques and tools for sensing and inferring context and high-level activities that are difficult to use interchangeably or evaluate comparatively. Investigators in each of these efforts have used homegrown representations of context information because no standards currently exist. We argue that these issues arise primarily because of the lack of a consistent information architecture used across the various context-aware applications and tools. To achieve interoperability and interchangeability requires that context data be sensed and shared in a meaningful way between different applications and tools. Furthermore, evaluation of the sensors, activity inferring techniques, and applications could be facilitated through the creation of  common test data sets for comparing various tools. The proposed research involves the design, development, and evaluation of a flexible and open infrastructure for storing and accessing context information.","Open infrastructure for data sharing and interoperability between context-aware applications","Computer software",CANADA,CANADA,"Information technology"

"Stochastic orders and their applications have been proposed in the past decades in a variety of areas of finance, probability and statistics. Ordering can give powerful approximation methods and bounds in situations where realistic stochastic models are too complicated for treatment. In this case, finding well-adapted orders which lead to tight bounds and good approximations becomes an important issue. Stochastic orders are also useful when the underlying distributions are only little known. Among these actuarial applications, ruin is a very important issue for insurance regulators, policyholders and shareholders. Ruin probability can serve as an indicator of an early warning system for potential insolvency. A high probability of ruin might require the insurer to raise premiums, increase the initial capital, or avoid taking the underlying claim amount risk. In this project, I would like to study stochastic orders for pairs of ruin probabilities and relevant actuarial quantities (including the deficit at ruin and the mean time to ruin, etc.) resulting from two claim size random variables with unequal premium rates, expected claim frequencies and claim severities, relative security loadings for corresponding two surplus processes perturbed by diffusion. These ordering relationships can also be used to obtain feasible upper and lower bounds on the underlying actuarial quantities. Thus, ordering pairs of ruin probabilities can help the actuary make the right decision: i.e., other business considerations being equal, taking the kind of risks yielding the lower ruin probability.","On the ordering for the surplus process perturbed by diffusion","Mathematical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Applied probability"
"I propose to continue my recent work in three projects, all of which involve nonlinearities which are critical in the sense that they compete with the linear differential operators in the equations.

      A. Gross-Pitaevskii equation.  This equation is a dynamical model for superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates in the physical dimensions d=2,3. It is a nonlinear Schrodinger equation coupled with a nonzero boundary condition at spatial infinity. When d=2,3, it possesses constant, stationary or traveling wave solutions, whose stability problem is my main concern.

      B. Landau-Lifshitz equations from R^d to S^2.  These equations are dynamical models for isotropic ferromagnetic spin systems.  They include the harmonic map heat flow and the Schrodinger flow as borderline cases. The existence of finite time singularity formation for finite energy solutions is only known for the harmonic map heat flow.  I would like to demonstrate the existence of singularity formation for the critical dimension d=2 in the special class of equivariant maps. I would also like to study the asymptotic behavior of the solution near a singularity, if it exists.

      C. Incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes equations. It is the fundamental system for fluid mechanics. Its regularity problem is a Millennium Problem. A fundamental first step is to exclude singularity under a scaling invariant bound, comparable to the self-similar rate, without smallness assumption. My recent work establishes such regularity result for axisymmetric flows. My next goal is to prove the regularity of axisymmetric flows without any further assumption.

"The objectives of my research program are the advancement of fundamental understanding of the pollutant dispersion in the neashore areas under complex environmental conditions, and the development of a 5th generation Watershed/Nearshore Management System by using new technologies such as"" Hydroinformatics"" that will provide reliable forecast for the movement of pollutants and accidental spills emitting from various land and surface or submerged nearshore sources. This system will assist engineers to achieve acceptable nearshore water quality and safe drinking water (water intake design guidelines and standardization processes) under current and future climate change conditions. The above objectives will be realized by:

(a) studying the momentum and mass of pollutant and sediment fluxes in the nearshore zone in the presence of currents and waves, 

(b) estimating the pollutographs at the basin outlets to the lake under extreme and climate change scenarios, 

(c) verifying the integrated basin/nearshore  water quality system with newly obtained and existing/operational field data, 

(d) assessing the benefits of abatement options related to infrastructure in terms of relocation, interception and treatment of source discharges in the nearshore areas between Niagara and Kingston in Lake Ontario, 

(e) assessing the impact of accidental spills from nuclear power plants to water drinking intakes and,  

(f) forecasting pollutant plume movement from point and non-point pollutant sources (nuclear power plants, storm sewers and by-passes from wastewater plants) for applications in environmental management.

The new integrated system with state-of-the-art interfaces will allow all levels of users to apply them with a minimum of operational effort.  By generating high quality output, it will enhance decision making in engineering and management practice thus resulting in advanced warning for action to be taken in order to protect the public's recreational activities and drinking water supply.

"One of our key objectives is to develop robust synthetic methodologies that are amenable to high throughput parallel synthesis of compounds that will serve as tools in investigations of complex networks of bimolecular interactions.  Currently, we are focusing on the design and synthesis of heterocyclic and peptidomimetic scaffolds that can selectively modulate the catalytic activity of human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (hFPPS) in vitro, in cell-based assays and in animal models.  The hFPPS enzyme occupies a strategic location at the first committed step of the mevalonate pathway leading to protein prenylation of the Ras oncogenic proteins.  In addition, this enzyme is implicated in the interferon-induced innate immune response against viral infections in humans. Therefore, hFPPS plays a crucial role at a cross-over point between the host's metabolism, oncogenesis and innate immunity. Studies in this area require the synthesis of numerous compounds which must be purifies by reversed phase HPLC and subsequently lyophilized to dryness.  The requested Freeze-Dryer instrument is a key component within a cluster of instruments required for the success of our research program.  This cluster of instruments is essential in achieving the efficiency and throughput of compound preparation that is needed in order to thoroughly investigate the interactions between hFPPS and its active site inhibitors, as well as the interactions between hFPPS and the host factor viperin, in vitro and in cell-based biological assays.

"The newt, Notophthalmus viridescens, has the ability to regenerate structures (eg. limbs, tail, spinal cord, lens) which are lost to injury or amputation.  Cells at the site of the injury revert back to an embryonic type of cell that can then proliferate and switch fate to rebuild the lost structure.  This process, called dedifferentiation, is one of the keys to the regeneration process, and understanding the molecular basis behind dedifferentiation could help to enhance regenerative potential in humans.  Studies have shown that mammalian muscle cells, when treated with newt regeneration extracts, re-enter the cell cycle and break-up from their multinucleated structures to yield proliferating mononuclear cells. This process is not very efficient, however, and many of the cells undergo cell death in the process.  The aim of the current research proposal is to study the dedifferentiation process in newt cells in order to better understand how to improve dedifferentiation and regeneration in humans.  We will study newt A1 muscle cells in culture that have been induced to dedifferentiate by adding serum to the medium or by treatment with newt-derived extracts.  We will use a technique called Representational Difference Analysis (RDA) to isolate and characterize genes with potential regulatory roles during the newt dedifferentiation process.  We present a comprehensive strategy for the isolation, prioritization and analysis of candidate genes with regulatory roles in the dedifferentiation process.  We will 1) Conduct RDA on cell lines to identify dedifferentiation-initiating candidate genes, 2) Prioritize cDNAs to identify relevant candidates and 3) Perform functional analysis of candidate genes in regeneration.  An understanding of the mechanisms involved in dedifferentiation will have tremendous therapeutic applications in degenerative disease and in neuronal injury.","Characterization of the dedifferentiation process induced by newt regeneration derived extracts","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Cell differentiation"

Graph algorithm is a branch of this basic research which addresses the computational complexity of graph-theoretic problems. Since any system involving a binary relation can be modeled by a graph, graph-theoretic problems arise naturally in a variety of applications/disciplines such as physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, psychology, biology and economics. Graph algorithm has thus attracted an enormous research interest in the last forty years and has become one of the most active research areas in computer science.



Graph connectivity is among the most extensively studied topics in graph algorithms. This is owing to the fact that it is one of the most basic properties of graphs and is fundamental to the studies of many other important concepts/ applications such as network reliability, circuit and chip design, network flow, cluster analysis, graph optimization, quantum physics and bioinformatics.



The main goal of this proposed research is to make contribution to the growing studies of algorithms for graph connectivity and related problems. Owing to the importance of graph connectivity, the results of the proposed research will have practical applications in many disciplines. As a matter of fact, some preliminary results of this proposed research had already found applications in quantum physics and bioinformatics.

"My research has 3 major thrusts in a lab of 14 people (10/2008): visual attention, mobile robotics, and computer vision. The overall objectives are two: 1. To further understanding of visual attention in humans and show how that understanding leads to better machine vision systems, and, 2. To develop the technology needed to help people with mobility impairments. For the first objective, there is the promise that a better understanding of human visual attention may lead to better understanding of visual and attentional mechanisms and thus, the failures that lead to serious problems such as neglect or degraded visual performance in the elderly or stroke victims. There is also the promise of more robust computer vision systems that may truly match performance of human vision in real world tasks. For the second objective, we hope to contribute to the solution of how to best allow people to age gracefully, in their homes or institutions, with mobility assistance and proper monitoring. To this end, the bulk of our work focuses on the development of an autonomous, intelligent, visually guided and visually monitored, wheelchair and robotic manipulator.

"The intent of this proposal is to request funding for the purchase of a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) with an Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy capability. The requested instrument expected to have resolution better than 2 nm and capable to resolve objects smaller than 10 nm. The EDX can identify the elemental composition of the specimens. Currently, there is only one FESEM serving ~1000 faculty member at the University of Waterloo (UW). This creates an overcrowded situation on the existing instrument. Each research group has been limited to 6 hour of tool time each week. This posts a devastating constrain on the quantity and quality of scientific research work produced at UW. An additional FESEM is needed because it is extremely critical for maintaining research at UW. To highlight the importance and desperation for this FESEM request, a group of UW faculty members and the Chemical Engineering Department banded together to provide $85k as matching fund for this instrument. The Chemical Engineering Department will also provide additional funds for the installation costs of this FESEM. Some of the projects that can benefit from the new instruments immediately include but are not limited to solar cells, high power fuel cells, high efficiency batteries, advanced drug delivery, flexible electronics, nanowires, nanotubes, nano-fluidic devices, nano-porous and magnetic thin films, advanced chemical catalyst, spintronics, and bio-composites for the automotive industry.

"With the increasing demand of integrated circuits (IC) computational speed performance, new nano-fabrication techniques and novel materials are needed. One of the most noticeable recent developments in the IC industry is the deployment of copper interconnects and ultra-low dielectric constant (ULK) materials in back-end-of-line structures. Interconnect lines are nanometer-scale metal wires used to connect transistors together.  To avoid electrical shorts between these nano-wires and to provide mechanical support for the IC devices, ULK materials are used to insulate these metal wires. The migration of copper/ULK from the out-dated aluminum/silicon dioxide technology is to reduce signal delay by the resistances of interconnect line and the capacitance cross-talks between them. In the future, IC technology with the characteristic transistor gate length smaller than 22 nm (22 nm technology node) will consist of ULK materials with target dielectric constants less than 2.1  To achieve this objective, the ULK will be incorporated with nanometer-scale empty voids or pores. This new class of material is commonly referred to as porous-ULK and can be produced by using the porogen-subtraction method. Organic template agents (porogen) are introduced into the silicate matrix material by using the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) techniques. They will be subsequently removed by a vaporization process using UV radiation at high temperature in an ultra-high-vacuum chamber. Depending on the amount of porogen used during the PECVD process, the final porosity in the porous-ULK film can be in the range of 20% to 40%. However, this technique has drawbacks which limit its application. This includes the difficulty of producing pores with diameters smaller than 2 nm which is the 22 nm technology node requirement. The UV cure process may increase the dielectric constant of the porous-ULK by modifying its molecular structures. Finally, as expected, the introduction of porosity into the silicate film reduces its mechanical and fracture strength. It is the goal of this research to understand the causes of these degradations and provide solutions by inventing new fabrication techniques.","Electrical and mechanically robust, porous, ultra-low dielectric constant materials","Materials sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical engineering"

Emerging techniques from ultrafast science and nanotechnology will be applied to unlock some of the mysteries in laser matter interactions. A comprehensive set of diagnostic and modeling capbilities are being develop to probe and to analyze the very complex interrelating phenomena involving in laser matter interactions. These diagnostic and modeling capbilities is expected to be useful for a wide range of research areas. 



The understanding of the detailed physics of laser matter interaction will be critical for the optimization of a number of laser applications including the nanomilling technique with sub-nanometer depth resolution, the successful development of fast ignition fusion  and laser driven particle accelerators. The optimization study of laser plasma deposition will involve the furher development of magnetic guided pulsed laser deposition (MGPLD) and glancing angle pulsed laser deposition (GAPLD).

These thin films will be used to develop devices for ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging of biological tissues and photonic devices  for generating ultrafast laser pulses. 



Through these research projects the next generation of researchers with skills and knowledge in plasma science, photonics, material science, nanotechnology and computational modeling will be trained. The training of HQP and the new knowledge generated from these research projects will make a significant impact in many fields in the natural science and engineering.

"Largely due to their lack of obvious heterogeneities in sedimentary texture, structure and mineralogy that normally form the basis of conventional sedimentological studies, mudrocks are notoriously difficult to interpret with respect to their depositional origins.  However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that their contained fossils can serve as alternative sources of such information. The proposed research aims to explore potential use of such remains as indicators of the sedimentary dynamics in mud-dominated marine environments, based largely on the paleoecologic and taphonomic (post-mortem) attributes of the fossil remains.  Much of the applicant's previous research has focused on the use of shell-rich deposits to bridge the stratigraphies of the Middle Devonian Hamilton Group in the Appalachian and Michigan sedimentary basins via the Chatham Sag of southwestern Ontario.  The proposed research will focus more on their use as paleoenvironmental indicators, and more specifically, as tools for interpreting the depositional dynamics recorded in ancient, mudrock-dominated marine successions that are otherwise lacking in sedimentary structures. 

    )	The other major component of the proposed research will address the nature of the common association of carbonate concretions with mudrock-hosted fossils.  It is generally agreed that concretion genesis is related to the generation of alkalinity by microbial decay processes, but the reasons why some macrofaunal remains influence concretion growth and not others remains unclear. To address this issue, the fossil content, physical structure, mineralogy, elemental geochemistry, and stratigraphic context of fossiliferous concretions from a variety of ancient mud-dominated successions will be compared. Previous studies have suggested that concretion growth can accompany either rapid sedimentation or sediment starvation. Accordingly, a better understanding of concretion formation may provide an additional tool that can be used in conjunction with shell beds to interpret the nature of sedimentation in ancient mud-dominated marine environments.

"A dynamic and uncertain production system can be easily found in these customized manufacturing companies, like Global Thermoelectric (GTE) in Calgary, where a specific customer order is fulfilled by once successful approach of product development, i.e. without prototype making and pre-production testing as normally done in batch or mass production companies. Production is scheduled based on specific customer orders. These companies are called One-of-a-Kind Production (OKP) companies. To provide a high costumer satisfaction, OKP companies will usually involve the customers through their product development cycle and employ a"" complicated supply chain as complementary manufacturing capacity to address diversified customization. Due to the continuous customer's influence and great uncertainties from the complicated supply chain, OKP companies are challenged by frequent changes in their production, such as product design change, manufacturing process change, delivery change (from the suppliers), etc., which have to be coped by adaptively changing the production schedule. No out-of-shelf technology or commercial computer software package is available for adaptively scheduling and control of OKP or dynamic and uncertain production system. In reality, OKP companies use human experts to schedule and control the production often in an ad hoc firefighting manner. To tackle this problem, this research project will employ a novel computer modeling techniques called Object-Oriented Petri Nets with Changeable Structure and Product Production Structure to develop an adaptive production scheduling and control system which is able to adaptively schedule and control production to cope with frequent changes and great uncertainties in OKP and at same time to keep the promised order delivery day, low production cost and high equipment utilization. The benefits to Canada are reflected from: a) The possible research outcomes will improve the GTE's competitive ability in the market and hence to maintain jobs in Canada, and b) The research outputs are expected to be widely applicable to a large number of small- or medium-sized enterprises in Canada, which are often OKP companies.","Dynamic Modeling and Scheduling of One-of-a-Kind Production",Engineering,CANADA,CANADA,Manufacturing
"It is recognized that the markets of the 21st century have placed increasing demands on manufacturers to be able to quickly deliver a great variety of customized products across the globe. The one-of-a-kind production (OKP) paradigm and its methodology with significant features of mass customization and concurrent engineering have been specifically developed to meet this challenge. One common finding is that great benefits can be achieved if the entire supply chain, which normally consists of raw materials or part supply (Phase 1), manufacture (Phase 2), and product distribution and delivery (Phase 3), can be integrated and adaptively planned and controlled. The integration of three phases of a supply chain in OKP will lead to a dramatic reduction in the inventory throughout the whole supply chain, reducing the production cost and lead time. The recent developments in mathematic modeling, simulation and computer, and Internet communication technologies are starting to allow for a greater integration of entire supply chain in OKP. However, the integration of the entire OKP supply chain using advanced mathematic modeling, simulation and computation technologies is a relatively un-researched area.

     Therefore, this research program aims to develop an Integrated and Adaptive OKP Supply Chain Planning and Control System. It has the following two objectives: (1) developing mathematic models, algorithms and/or heuristics for computerized evaluation of supplier availability and suitability; (2) developing a three-phase, integrated and adaptive supply chain planning and control system. 

     This is a pilot study in the area of manufacturing engineering, mathematic modeling and supply chain management. The deliverables from this research program are expected to improve the theory, knowledge and practice of integrated supply chain management in Canadian small- or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to enhance their competitive ability in global markets.

"We have demonstrated that cranberry derived proanthocyanidins (PACs) have the potential to reduce the occurrence and duration of catheter-associated infection by preventing bacterial adhesion to catheter surfaces and promoting mammalian cell health. The aim of the proposed research is to develop an effective method to integrate cranberry-derived PACs into biomaterial matrices that do not undermine the anti-adhesive properties of the PACs for the prevention of biomaterial related infections. The research will focus on impregnating cranberry PACs in polymeric materials to be used as medical catheters; i.e., urinary catheters and central line catheters. These materials will be based on (1) silicone elastomers, a commonly used polymer in catheter development, (2) elastomeric blends of methacrylate/styrene-isopene-styrene copolymers, and (3) degradable matrices based on poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) that may be used as coatings. Once impregnated into these polymer matrices, the PACs must retain their biological activity. We will therefore need to evaluate the anti-adhesive properties of these new hybrid polymeric materials against a range of infectious organisms. This research will generate incremental and valuable data to design a new generation of hybrid anti-adhesive biomaterials (HAABs) for the medical catheters industry. In 2005, the revenue from the medical devices market for antimicrobial coatings totaled $US 80.4 million and it is expected to reach $US 249.4 million in 2012 at a compound annual growth rate of 17.6% during the period 2005 to 2012. The catheter segment is expected to see huge growth in the medical devices industry as safety and protection from microbes are of primary concern in the use of these devices. The development of HAABs will be done with partner organizations who have a significant interest in the potential for their commercialization; namely medical device technology firms and cranberry producers/marketers.","New hybrid anti-adhesive biomaterials for medical devices industry","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical materials"
"Nanomaterials are used in the fabrication of paints, coatings, cosmetics, and many other consumer goods. Many other applications of nanomaterials are expected in the near future, for medical treatment and detection systems, energy production and environmental remediation. It is anticipated that by 2015, the global market for ""nano"" products will exceed US$1 trillion. Although nanotechnologies promise many social and economic benefits, recent reports published in North America and Europe underline the potential environmental and public health risks linked to this ""nano"" revolution. A portion of manufactured nanomaterials will end up in the natural environment (e.g., as a result of accidental spills or deliberately introduced for soil and groundwater remediation). As there are no specific regulations to deal with these novel substances, there is an urgent need to better understand the consequences of nanotechnology on environmental health, in order to set protective rules and regulations that do not unjustly penalize Canadian industries. In the interest of fully assessing environmental risk, we need to be able to predict the transport, persistence and bioavailability of engineered nanoparticles in terrestrial ecosystems. This strategic project aims to provide regulators and industries with novel insights and tools needed to assess and predict the transport and transformations of engineered nanoparticles in soils, and to evaluate their toxicity. We propose to evaluate these processes in well-parameterized systems and describe the key mechanisms with mathematical models.   The novel data and mechanistic models will greatly improve our understanding of the environmental risks of engineered nanoparticles. We will examine both model conditions but also a large number of Canadian soils of varying properties. The models developed during this project can be linked with multi-criteria decision analysis and environmental risk assessment models. Hence, the knowledge acquired during this project will be of great strategic value to Canadian industries and will provide government agencies like Health Canada and Environment Canada with better decision frameworks and policies to protect human and ecosystem health.","Tools to measure and model the transport, transformations and toxicity of engineered nanoparticles in terrestrial ecosystems",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Transport processes"
"Understanding the factors and mechanisms controlling the transport and retention of microorganisms (e.g, bacteria and protozoa) and colloids in aqueous systems is important for in-situ bioremediation, protection of subsurface environments from waterborne contaminants, design of water and wastewater treatment facilities, and development of improved implantable medical devices. Although considerable research efforts have been directed at elucidating the interactions governing the transport and fate of biological and nonbiological colloids in aqueous environments, a number of unresolved issues remain. This research aims to address the influence of biofilms and variations in their properties and composition on microbial and particle transport and retention in natural and engineered aqueous systems. Biofilms are structured communities of microorganisms enclosed within a self-developed matrix of excreted polymeric substances and adherent to a living or inert surface. In the natural subsurface environment, biofilm can form on the surface of soil grains, thereby altering their physicochemical properties and hence their filtration efficiency. 

The overall objective of this research is to study the influence of biofilm on microbe and particle retention and release in aqueous environments using well-controlled laboratory experiments. The study will relate microscale measurements of biocolloid and colloid retention and release as well as measured properties of cell and colloid surfaces with macroscale observations obtained in column experiments.  We aim to develop novel approaches to characterize biofilm surface and viscoelastic properties using an electrokinetic analyzer and quartz crystal microbalance, and biofilm structure using X-ray CT. Results of this experimental work will provide an improved understanding of the fundamental mechanisms controlling (bio)colloid transport, retention, and release in aqueous systems. This information will be used to develop improved models for prediction of contaminant transport and removal in natural and engineered environments as well as design of bioremediation processes.","Macroscopic and microscopic aspects of microbe and colloid transport and retention in aqueous systems",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical engineering"

"This proposal is directed toward the Strategic target area of Healthy Environment and Ecosystems and addresses the research topic of Waste Management and Site Remediation, Analytical Tools.



There is much concern over the potential hazards of industrial and landfill remediation sites and landfill gas emissions. Hazardous air pollutants (HAP) at sufficient levels can result in negative health effects due to both short-term and long-term exposures.



Recent technical advances suggest an opportunity to dramatically improve emissions monitoring through the use of laser technology. Quantification of fugitive emission of pollutants over very large areas will become possible by combining a new laser technology, known as the Quantum Cascade Laser, with a new emissions monitoring technique called Radial Plume Mapping.



The first objective of this project is to develop a Quantum Cascade laser suitable for open path spectroscopic analysis of atmospheric pollutants. The second objective is to develop an open path mid infrared spectroscopic analyzer technology that is suitable for use hi the field. The final objective is to apply the new QCL technology to site remediation and other similar applications. The third objective, which will involve field trials, is longer term and beyond the scope of this proposal but would be the outcome of its successful completion. The laser technology will include microelectromechanicalsystems (MEMS) and will be fabricated using Nanotechnology fabrication facilities.



The project will involve two companies; Boreal Laser, a manufacturer of laser environmental analyzers and ;Norcada, a MEMS developer and manufacturer. Part of the project will be supervised by two representatives from these companies. The project will also involve a member of the engineering faculty,a member of the science faculty, four students and two research associates.

"I am interested in a variety of problems in continuum theory and dynamics. Some of  these problems have  their roots in analysis and set -theory. 



Studying  the relation between the properties of boundaries of basic open sets of a topological space and the properties of the space itself is  of great interest for me. In particular, I am interested in studying rim-metrizable locally connected continuua. Some of the problems are related to an important problem from set-theoretical topology concerning perfectly normal compact spaces. 



An important problem in Complex Dynamics is the classification of Julia sets  of rational maps and understanding the structure of them. Knowing the topological  structure of a Julia set gives insight to understanding the dynamical system associated with the Julia set.  Many of the Julia sets are continua. I am interested in studying the topological structure of Julia sets as well as  understanding the conditions under which indecomposable continua may appear in a Julia set.



Another interesting and old problem concerns different measures on a space, such as volume.  The problem is to find  a characterization of spaces with a suitable metric so that  the space has finite measure (or volume).

"The Victoria Experimental Network Under the Sea (VENUS) is an innovative approach to ocean research that is unique in the world.  VENUS is an online real-time observatory of ocean instruments at three sites in coastal waters near southern Vancouver Island.  Cameras and instruments measuring physical, chemical, biological and geological properties are plugged into seafloor modules that provide electrical power and digital network connections and are, in turn, connected by fibre-optic cable to shore stations.  From there the data and images stream, via the Internet, to the Network Operations Centre and Data Management and Archive System at the University of Victoria.  The VENUS website (www.venus.uvic.ca) allows anyone, through the Internet, to examine marine conditions in Saanich Inlet and the Strait of Georgia.  They can also download VENUS data, sounds and images for further research.  A scientist can log on, browse the state of the ocean, and take control of his or her experiment using simple Internet tools. Students anywhere can study the ocean without leaving home. In its first three months of public access, the VENUS website had more than 1 million page views.  While only one site is currently delivering data, VENUS is serving faculty and students at seven Canadian universities in five provinces, four federal agencies and four foreign universities and agencies.  Their initial research with VENUS covers a broad range of topics such as animal behaviour, biodiversity of benthic invertebrates, impacts of microbial metabolism on sediment biogeochemistry, ocean technology development, and data mining techniques.  NSERC MRS funding will support an operations team, user outreach, and maintenance of VENUS subsea infrastructure, Network Operations Centre, and Data Management and Archiving System.

"This proposal concerns two distinct areas of study: stochastic partial differential equations and molecular dynamics.



Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are mathematical models that describe the evolution of spatially extended systems under the influence of external noise.  One project in this area concerns the development of faster algorithms for a particular class of SPDEs known as phase field models which frequently arise of models of various physical phenomena.  Another project concerns resolving a discrepancy apparent in current research where physicists frequently study models which have no solid mathematical grounding.  A third project concerns using SPDEs (and other stochastic models) to model the process of bone regeneration.   In each case the research is highly interdisciplinary involving an incorporation of ideas from mathematics, scientific computing, and physics.



Molecular dynamics is the computer simulation of a system at the atomistic level.  The equations describing the behaviour of sytems in molecular dynamics are chaotic and it is impossible to compute trajectories exactly.  However, stastistical information extracted from these trajectories is often accurate nonetheless.  This proposed research will continue my successful investigation of this topic.  An important concept in my approach is that of shadowing.  Rougly, a numerical trajectory can be shadowed if an exact trajectory can be found that is close to it over long time intervals.

"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae preferentially uses glucose as a carbon source. Upon glucose exhaustion, this yeast can use non-sugar carbons (non-fermentable carbons) such as ethanol, lactate and acetate. This results in massive reprogramming of gene expression to adapt to the new carbon source. This process is controlled by the master kinase Snf1 which phosphorylates various substrates including the transcription factors Cat8 and Sip4 that control expression of specific genes by binding to Carbon Source Response Elements found in the promoters of the target genes. For example, these factors upregulate the expression of PCK1 encoding a very important enzyme for gluconeogenesis. Cat8 and Sip4 belong to the Gal4 family of zinc cluster proteins that form an important class of transcriptional regulators in yeast. We have characterized the zinc cluster protein Rds2 by performing genome-wide localization (ChIP-chip) of this factor and found that it is a very important regulator of gluconeogenesis. However, Rds2 and Cat8 show a limited number of common target genes. Thus, they have specific and common functions. We are also characterizing another zinc cluster gene we named ERT1 (for Ethanol Regulator of Translation). ChIP-chip analysis shows that under ethanol conditions, this factor binds to some gluconeogenic genes (e.g. PCK1), ribosomal proteins genes as well as genes encoding mitochondrial components and two genes encoding two subunits of the TFIIIC complex involved in RNA polymerase III transcription. There is also evidence that another zinc cluster protein, Gsm1, is also involved in controlling gene expression for adaptation to a non-fermentable carbon source. Clearly, regulation of gene expression following glucose exhaustion is a more complex process than initially anticipated. This proposal is aimed at better characterizing the role of the transcription factors Rds2, Ert1, Cat8, Sip4, and Gsm1. More specifically we will: 1) Determine the role of Ert1 with glucose or ethanol as carbon sources 2) Study the function of Gsm1 3) Determine the relative contribution and the interplay of Rds2, Ert1, Cat8, Sip4 and Gsm1 in mediating utilization of ethanol, lactate, glycerol, and acetate as carbon sources.

"Given the current emphasis on sustainability and the effective use of natural resources (including petroleum-derived hydrocarbons), significant opportunities exist for developing new types of highly reactive catalysts that are able to improve the efficiency of existing chemical processes, or that can provide access to entirely new synthetic protocols that are less wasteful. Transition metal catalysts in particular have risen to the challenge of providing solutions for many of the problems of modern synthetic chemistry, and as such, most breakthroughs in catalysis are rooted in the fundamental study of transition metal reactivity. In this context, research in the Turculet group targets the preparation of transition metal complexes that exhibit new and/or improved reactivity properties by virtue of their unique construction. The Turculet group is specifically targeting new families of transition metal pincer complexes that feature formally anionic heavier main group element donors (e.g. Si, P), and has successfully shown that complexes of this type are active in catalysis (e.g. transfer hydrogenation of ketones) and are highly reactive, as indicated by their ability to selectively cleave the C-H and N-H bonds of hydrocarbons and amines (respectively) under mild conditions. The characterization and structural elucidation of such complexes plays a crucial role in this research, as it allows for structure-activity analysis and facilitates the rational design of catalysts for targeted chemical transformations. The requested Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer will be employed on a continual basis by synthetic chemistry researchers, including the Turculet group, in the Department of Chemistry at Dalhousie University as a key instrument for the characterization and structural assignment of new organic, inorganic, and transition metal-containing compounds. This instrumentation will provide crucial data that will enable researchers to piece together an understanding of the structure and composition of new molecules and materials, thereby facilitating the identification of effective new strategies for meeting synthetic challenges.

"As stated by the 2007 Priestley Medalist, George M. Whitesides, ""almost everything in chemistry is catalyzed."" Transition metal catalysts in particular have risen to the challenge of providing solutions for many of the problems of modern synthetic chemistry, specifically with respect to the development of new chemical processes that convert abundant resources into value-added products in an efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly manner. The impact of transition metal catalysis was recognized in the awarding of the 2001 and 2005 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. The development of such reactive catalysts represents an ongoing challenge that spans a range of chemical disciplines (e.g. organic, inorganic, environmental). Notably, all such breakthroughs are rooted in the fundamental study of transition metal reactivity. In this context, research in the Turculet group targets the preparation of reactive transition metal complexes that exhibit new and/or improved reactivity properties by virtue of their unique construction.  Key to this endeavor is the design and synthesis of new ancillary ligands that impart novel structural and electronic characteristics to the ensuing metal complexes. The proposed research seeks to develop the metal chemistry of new ancillary 'pincer'-type ligands that feature previously under-explored, formally anionic heavier main group element donors (e.g. Si, P). Overarching questions that we seek to address in this research include: (i) Can such pincer complexes be prepared, and do they exhibit new or unusual reactivity properties? (ii) Does the replacement of traditionally employed anionic donors (e.g. C, N) with their heavier congeners (e.g. Si, P) in such complexes provide improved reactivity in established catalytic reactions (e.g. transfer hydrogenation)? (iii) Can electron-rich complexes featuring such 'heavier-element' pincer ligands mediate challenging bond activation reactions (e.g. N2, C-H) that are of fundamental importance for the utilization of abundant but unreactive resources? These studies will advance our understanding of how metal-ligand interactions influence reactivity, enabling the design of metal catalysts that can mediate new and increasingly challenging substrate transformations.

"The present context related to the generation and use of cleaner energy favors the development of technologies based on thermoelectric (TE) materials. From those materials, it is possible to fabricate various devices called TE modules that have no moving mechanical parts resulting in reliable performances. The modules can be operated in cooler mode based on Peltier effect or in thermoelectric generator mode where electricity is produced from waste heat. The performance of thermoelectric materials is evaluated from their figure of merit. To obtain high values of the figure of merit, the material should have at the same time high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. Some semiconductors have this particular behavior giving better TE properties. Among the various approaches for reducing thermal conductivity, one of the most promising is to produce nanostructured materials. By having more interfaces between nanocrystals, higher contribution of thermal resistance comes from the lattice component. During the last years, our research group at ï¿½cole Polytechnique has developed a method to produce semiconductor alloys based on bismuth telluride alloys from powder metallurgy. The method consists in alloy synthesis by mechanical alloying followed by hot extrusion. Preliminary characterization of the alloyed powders revealed that particles of sub-micron size are polycrystalline with grain size in the range 5-20 nm. The goal of the proposed research project is to characterize the evolution of nanostructured materials along the production process of bulk thermoelectric materials. The study and analysis of the nanostructures will be done with the help of advanced X ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Within the course of the project, we will also verify the feasibility to produce actual devices and systems built with modules fabricated by using bulk nanostructured TE alloys. The performance of systems will be evaluated on real refrigerators build by one of our industrial partner in the project.

"Today's Internet users are exposed to an abundance of information from many sources such as e-mail and web pages. The sheer quantity of information can easily overload users, and adversely affect their ability to filter, analyze, consume, and understand all of this information in its various forms. The new wave in web use, commonly referred to as web 2.0, brings in a variety of opportunities for information dissemination and use. Yet, the information overload problem that existed for the earlier Internet applications still presents itself, arguably in an aggravated form. As of this writing, Technorati (technorati.com), the largest blog search engine, tracks almost 110 million blog sites (as a comparison, this figure was only 24.5 million in January, 2006) and over 250 million pieces of tagged social media. Given that search engines index only a portion of the existing information space and that there are over 175,000 new blogs every day regularly updated by 1.6 million posts per day, it is clear that information overload on web 2.0 will be even more pressing than it has been so far.

We believe that the forum created by the blogosphere could be essential to group decision-making. However, the information overload problem inherent in its current structure limits it from reaching this potential: an individual who is looking for ways to understand and use the abundance of the material in the blogosphere is very likely to be overwhelmed and look for some (usually ineffective) coping strategies. Accordingly, the objectives of the research program are: 1. to study and implement different techniques for better managing the information on the blogosphere. Since attempting to change the present form of creating content on the blogosphere is rather unrealistic, content management techniques should emphasize the re-organization and better presentation of the already available blog content for supporting blog readers. 2. to evaluate the systems resulting from the implementation of these techniques. 3. to create a model of user interactions with the blogosphere. We aim to accomplish an understanding of blog readers' purposes in engaging in the blogosphere, the typical tasks they perform, and their challenges in using blog management systems.

"Peatlands cover c. 170 million hectares of Canada's land surface, making Canada one of the world's leaders in industrial peat resource extraction, export, and use. Until recently, wildfires were thought to have little impact on peatlands as high water table levels inhibited combustion. Our recent research, however, shows that wildfires already play an important role in Canadian peatland carbon cycling and regional fire emissions.  Additionally, northern peat reserves likely are becoming increasingly vulnerable to wildfire as climate change enhances the severity of summer droughts, lowering water tables and exposing deeper peat to burning.  Approximately $500 million/year is spent on fire management activities in Canada, with more than $1 billion spent during large fire years. With climate change and the increased likelihood of drought, area burned each year in Canada is expected to rise substantially. Peat fires currently are problematic for fire management because they require increased financial and suppression resource commitments. Thus, new insights on peatland vulnerability to burning and the ecological consequences of drought and wildfire in peatlands are important for both the peat resource and fire management communities. We will develop new approaches and tools for characterizing the ecological consequences of sustained drought in peatlands and quantifying the physical constraints of drought-impacted peat on flaming and smouldering combustion. We also will develop the first peatland hydrological and wildfire model to predict fire danger and combustion patterns under pristine

and drought conditions. Data from this research will provide fire managers with a new decision-aid for predicting critical areas with a high potential to support deep burning peat fires. Given that smouldering leads to high emissions associated with human health hazards, such as particulate organic matter and mercury, the development of such predictives tool also could lead to public health warnings in advance of poor air quality conditions linked to fire emissions.","The effects of drought on the vulnerability of forested peatlands to wildfire","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)",CANADA,CANADA,"Evolution and ecology"
"High latitude regions are experiencing rapid climate change, which has led to longer growing seasons, permafrost degradation, and more than a doubling of annual burn areas. The boreal biome has the potential to either curtail or amplify future climate change depending on how ecosystem carbon and energy fluxes respond to environmental change. More than 80% of the boreal soil carbon pool is stored in peatlands, which cover about 1.2 million km2 of land in Canada. While peatlands clearly have served as a long-term sink of atmospheric carbon, it is unclear whether they will continue to accumulate carbon, or whether these ecosystems will begin to release C back to the atmosphere under future climate regimes. Investigations of the controls on peatland carbon cycling are important for understanding the fundamental principles of ecosystem function in northern systems, but also have significant applied relevance for the understanding and amelioration of global change.



My students and I use observations and field experiments to investigate the effects of plant species composition and disturbance on aspects of ecosystem health in boreal peatlands.  We will conduct a series of studies in both pristine and burned sites to investigate the effects of moss community composition and traits on decomposition processes in peatlands, and to document the immediate and longer-term effects of wildfire on aspects of ecosystem health and climate feedbacks. This research will improve predictions of how northern wetlands will respond to climate change, and will provide insights into the impacts of climate change and disturbances on natural resource management.","Effects of plant species and disturbance on ecosystem function in boreal peatlands",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Plant ecology"

One component of my research program investigates the role of disturbance in the ecological processes regulating carbon balance in peatlands. My previous research has shown that boreal fires are becoming more frequent with climate change, that peatlands are becoming increasingly vulnerable to wildfire with drought and lower water table positions, and that fire activity affects peatland carbon fluxes through fuel consumption and post-fire vegetation and soil recovery. In the proposed research, my students and I will conduct a series of studies in sites varying in time since last fire to investigate the immediate and longer-term effects of wildfire on aspects of ecosystem health. This research will improve predictions of how northern wetlands will respond to climate change, and will foster the training of students and personnel in field research skills for Canada's North.

"Hybridization is increasingly recognized as a diversifying force in animal evolution. High hybrid fitness is more frequent in novel, marginal, or dynamic habitats. Causes of higher hybrid fitness, however, are only partly known. My research program employs an integrative approach involving field and experimental studies coupled with genetic characterization to investigate how new genetic combinations can provide higher fitness in dynamic ecological settings. I take advantage of the Fundulus hybrid complex where two fish species (Fundulus heteroclitus and F. diaphanus) typically found at different salinities have hybridized to produce sexually reproducing and gynogenetic hybrids. The latter comprises all-female clones that need sperm from Fundulus males to trigger egg development. Ecological surveys are conducted to establish the relative distribution of parental and hybrid forms in habitats of intermediate and/or variable salinity such as estuaries, tidal rapids, coastal lakes and lagoons. In parallel, preliminary estimates of hybrid frequency, introgression levels and clonal diversity are refined by genome-wide genetic characterization with AFLP markers. Ecological and genetic knowledge are coupled by examining fitness-related traits such as ionoregulation ability, survival and growth in the field (transplant experiments) and in the lab (common garden experiments). Here, the availability of fixed clonal genotypes is particularly appropriate to disentangle the genetic, maternal, environmental sources of phenotypic variation impacting on fitness components. Given their constant genetic background, clones are also useful to examine allelic gene expression in hybrids. This integrated analysis of natural gynogens will offer opportunities to test competing hypothesis on the ecological breadth of clones. This research will also be relevant to the fields of functional and environmental physiology and genomics, which use F. heteroclitus as a model organism. The proposed research will involve one Ph. D., three M. Sc., and five B. Sc students. These students will be trained in documenting and interpreting ecological, phenotypic and genetic variation from a holistic point of view.","Ecology and genetics of hybrid animals","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Evolution and ecology"

"Tissue microenvironment and architecture are important regulators of normal cell functions: e.g. both of these factors affect gene expression. This ability appears to require a ""back and forth"" flow of information between the intracellular machinary of individual cells and their extracellular mileu.   The mechanisms that facilitate this bidirectional flow of information are not fully understood although the ability of cells to ""sense"" their environment through specific receptors is an important part of sustaining such intimate connections between cells and their microenvironment.  An accepted ""receptor sensing"" paradigm is that of a group of extracelular matrix receptors known as integrins that are integral membrane proteins, which respond both to extracellular and intracellular stimuli (e.g. extracellular collageintracellular protein phosphorylation): Integrins are thus able capable of bidirectional signaling which rapidly connects changes of cellular metabolism to the extracellular milieu and vice verse. An evolutionarily ancient form of bidirectional signaling that is still poorly understood is the ability of cells to export, through unusual and poorly characterized means, cytoplasmic proteins into the extracellular space. Export appears to happen in response to tissue stress and provides an early warning mechanism for alerting cell populations of impending danger.  Thus, released cytoplasmic proteins bind to cell surface receptor,which activates specific singaling cascades alerting the cell of danger and allowing a response (e.g. cell division and/or motility).   Studying the mechanisms for this as yet poorly understood process will expand our knowledge of how cells adjust to their environment and maintain steady-state function.

"All eukaryotic cells feature membrane-bound organelles containing DNA, called mitochondria and (in algae and land plants) chloroplasts. By studying the genes encoded in these vital cellular components involved in energy production, researchers have found that in several eukaryotic lineages, including green algae and land plants, the chloroplast (cp) and mitochondrial (mt) genomes exhibit considerable diversity in size, structure, gene content, gene order and intron content. Our group is determining and analyzing the complete sequences of organelle genomes from green algae, which range in size from 20,000 to 350,000 bases. All living green plants (Viridiplantae) are divided into two phyla: the Chlorophyta, comprising the bulk of the green algae, and the Streptophyta, comprising the green algae from the class Charophyceae and all land plants. We have recently shown that the cp genome is evolving much more conservatively in the Streptophyta than in the Chlorophyta and that the cp genome of land plants inherited a myriad of traits from their charophycean green algal ancestors. In contrast, the mt genome sustained radical changes during the evolution of both chlorophytes and streptophytes and it appears that land plant mtDNAs inherited only a few structural characters from charophycean green algae. The aims of the proposed research are two-fold: (1) to understand how streptophyte and chlorophyte organelle genomes diverged over evolutionary time and (2) to resolve the branching order of problematic green algal lineages in the tree of life. Complete cpDNA and mtDNA sequences from representatives of various green algal lineages will be determined, decoded, and compared to their previously sequenced green plant homologs. Using a phylogenic framework inferred from whole organelle genomes, we will be reconstruct scenarios of gene losses, gene rearrangements and intron gains/losses. The information gained will help us to decipher the forces that shape organelle genomes. This information is also crucial for understanding how green algae evolved and gave rise to land plants. We expect that the proposed studies will represent a major Canadian contribution in the area of organelle genomics.","Deciphering pathways of chloroplast and mitochondrial genome evolution in green algae","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Genome analysis"

"Enzymes can accelerate chemical reactions by more than a million-fold.  We are interested in understanding how amino acid residues within enzymes bring about this rate acceleration. Some residues are involved in binding, others participate in the chemistry of the reaction, while other groups are involved in both. Enzymes can also be inhibited by the direct products or end products of the pathway to which they belong.  



Our main focus is on dehydrogenase enzymes involved in the terminal reactions in the biosynthesis of tyrosine. These enzymes are part of the TyrA protein family. In some organisms, the dehydrogenase is encoded on a single polypeptide chain, while in other organisms the protein also contains mutase activity. We wish to further understand the dehydrogenase enzyme in both its monofunctional and bifunctional forms, through studies of several enzymes within this family.  We will map out their similarities and differences in structure, catalytic mechanism and in the identity and role of residues involved in binding tyrosine and the inhibition of enzyme activity. 



We have recently solved the structure of a monofunctional dehydrogenase from a hyperthermophilic bacterium in complex with substrates and products. This structure, along with others in the TyrA family will be used to guide our mechanistic studies. 



Tyrosine is an essential component in proteins and is also an essential precursor of the synthesis of a number of alkaloids and secondary metabolites that are important pharmaceuticals.  Thus, understanding the mechanism whereby tyrosine inhibition can be abrogated without affecting catalysis will have applications in metabolic engineering for tyrosine overproduction.

"Rich ensembles of stars known as open clusters are beautiful sights in our Galaxy, and the common age, distance, and original chemical composition of their member stars make them ideal calibrators of intrinsic properties (luminosity, temperature, and evolutionary status) for associated objects. Especially important are Cepheid variables, pulsating supergiant stars used as distance indicators to nearby galaxies because the duration of their characteristic brightness cycles relates directly to intrinsic brightness. An additional characteristic described by rate of period change and pulsation amplitude correlates more precisely with their evolutionary status, and may resolve questions about pulsation mode as well. Another common constituent of young clusters are pulsating M supergiants, standard candles in their own right much like Cepheids, but also the last stage of evolution for stars 20-25 times more massive than the Sun prior to their explosion as Type II supernovae. Like Cepheids, the common thread linking such objects is that they represent advanced stages of stellar evolution, where existing observational data can be used to test predictions from increasingly-sophisticated stellar evolutionary models with reality. In the case of M supergiants, it may be possible to detect an observational signature that provides advanced warning of their forthcoming demise.","Observational characterization of intermediate mass stars","Space and astronomy",CANADA,CANADA,Stellar

"Carbonate sedimentary rocks (limestone and dolostone) are the single best source of information about Earth's surface conditions, the evolution of Earth's biotas, and the chemical state of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere through most of the last 2.5 billion years. Earth's surface conditions changed dramatically and permanently through that interval, from initial conditions almost entirely unlike those of today, to conditions that loosely resemble the modern Earth. Understanding this long but critical transition requires a detailed understanding of the carbonate rocks deposited in Earth's early oceans.



This research aims to contribute new perspectives on the evolution of carbonate-depositional systems from the early Earth, the evidence of early microbial life that they contain, and the information they can convey about the economically valuable metal deposits that they host. The work will be dominated by field research in northern Canada, augmented by analytical microscopy and geochemistry. Outcomes will contribute to our understanding of what the early Earth was like and how microbial life developed and evolved. It will also provide insight into why carbonate-hosted metal deposits are located where they are, information which will aid in the discovery of other mineral deposits of economic importance to Canada.

"Our research group studies resistance to antimicrobial compounds including antiseptics, DNA inter-chelating dyes and heavy metals. Through these questions we explore proteins found in the cell membrane that mediate these resistances. We also study how proteins move across membranes and how electron-transfer proteins - the energy machinery in the cell - come together and mature into a functional form.  In order to study these systems we employ the tool of chromatography, which is a key technique in life science laboratories and is used to purify, evaluate, identify, and characterize molecules and cells.  Our group uses a variety of chromatography methods including but not inclusively: ion exchange, reverse phase, size-exclusion, affinity and pseudo-affinity.  Each of these methods separate molecules based on their chemical properties.  The present grant asks for funds for the purchase of a Fast Protein Liquid chromatography (FPLC) system.   Such a system allows us to purify proteins, peptides and amino acids as well as exchange buffers of the proteins.  Integral membrane proteins are found in cell membranes and are very difficult to work with, as they require detergents to keep them soluble.  They are also found in small quantities.  Therefore, considerable effort is required to purify amounts at levels high enough to characterize their structures and functions.  As we study proteins involved in the maturation of electron transfer proteins we perform mutagenesis experiments changing amino acids to understand the protein-protein interactions.  Thus, each mutant protein must be purified along with the parent protein form to compare in various biophysical and biochemical experiments.  Between these projects, a large number of proteins need to be purified by my group.  An FPLC is the best and most efficient manner to do this.  Over 15 researchers and research trainees will find constant use for the FPLC requested.","FPLC instrumentation for bacterial protein purification","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Proteins and peptides, amino acids"

"Embryonic stem cells (ESC) offer tremendous potential for addressing a host of important biomedical problems, both in clinical and laboratory settings. This potential has generated extraordinary excitement over the use of these cells to devise novel cellular therapies for many currently debilitating and costly human diseases (e.g., diabetes and Parkinson's disease), as well as irreparable injuries (e.g., spinal cord paralysis). There are, however, many hurdles to overcome between our present state and new therapeutic applications. One of the fundamental technological obstacles that dramatically slows progress in this area is the lack of rapid, nondestructive assays for distinguishing ESC from other (differentiated) cells within a growing culture. We are proposing to develop such a rapid, nondestructive, non-contact screening methodology based on an optical technique called coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy. This nonlinear optical method permits imaging of ESCs in situ within a culture and exploits the rich chemical information carried by the CARS signal to distinguish stem cells from differentiating cells. Specifically, we are proposing i) to develop a robust optical component system for efficient exposure and collection of CARS spectra and advanced signal-processing methods to aid the interpretation of CARS spectra of ESC; ii) to undertake the first spectrochemical imaging investigation involving human ESC to identify and characterize the spectral features most sensitive to cellular changes (and/or the rate of such changes) accompanying differentiation; iii) to prepare this technology for installation at an existing bioimaging core facility that provides access by stem cell biologists and other medical scientists. This project will lay the foundation for accelerated progress toward developing human embryonic stem cell-based therapies and will facilitate the broader use of these cells to identify new drugs that stimulate or repress particular regenerative events in vivo.","A spectrochemical imaging system for rapid and nondisruptive screening for pluripotency and differentiation in cultures of embryonic stem cells","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Bioanalytical chemistry"

The focus of my research is the modelling, analysis, and application of spatial (particularly planar) point patterns.  Examples of spatial point patterns include locations of mineral deposits in a region being explored by a mining company, locations of birds' nests in a nesting area, locations of towns in a geographical region, locations of forest fires in a region, and the locations of stars, quasistellar objects, or galaxies in a sector of outer space.



The simplest of such patterns exhibit ""complete spatial randomness"" (CSR).  Other patterns depart from CSR by having trends in their intensity (density or concentration of points) or by having dependence or interaction among the points.  Often the practical questions which arise involve assessing whether trends are associated with possible explanatory variables (covariates) such as terrain characteristics, vegetation, and soil type.  In the case of point patterns of forest fires, covariates also include concentrations of human population and proximity to aspects of human activity such as mills, roads, and railroads.



Assessing statistically the evidence for association of trends with covariates requires that the (possible) interaction between points, mentioned above, be allowed for.  This in turn requires modelling such interaction.  My research is focussed on such modelling, assessment of the adequacy of the models, and hence assessment of the influence of covariates upon trends.  The results will be applied to and validated upon patterns of forest fire locations in New Brunswick.

"Verticillium wilt (Verticillium dahliae) is an important disease affecting strawberry production in Canada for which the current methods of control are limited to the use of fumigants. Fumigation represents numerous inconveniences that are not conducive to sustainable agriculture. Indeed, fumigation is an expensive practice involving the use of toxic active ingredients that have negative environmental and social impacts. Moreover, the use of fumigants will not only eradicate the target pathogen but also benefic soilborne microorganisms. This creates a microbiological void in which different pathogens including V. dahliae can more readily occupy the ecological niche and cause more devastating infections of the strawberry plants. The application of composts could provide an efficient method to significantly reduce or completely replace the use of synthetic fumigants. The use of composts following fumigation would restore the microbiological void created by the application of fumigants and could therefore result in an environment less conducive to high infection by V. dahliae. As part of ongoing research aimed at developing environmentally-safe and sustainable strategies for the control of plant diseases, the present project will focus on the following objectives: (i) to determine the effect of compost types, doses and period of application on the development of strawberry verticillium wilt under greenhouse and commercial growing conditions, (ii) to investigate the potential role of compost/substrate physico-chemical and microbiological properties in the inhibition of strawberry verticillium wilt, and (iii) to recommend a control strategy for verticillium wilt of strawberries including the appropriate doses and periods of application of composts alone or in combination with reduced applications of fumigants. Expected benefits of the proposed project include a rapid transfer of the results of the study to the horticulture industry considering the familiarity of growers with the use of composts and the fact that the horticulture industry and governments have recognized the physiological and nutritional benefits of composts towards plants.

"In the pursuit of sustainable wastewater and wastewater sludge management, the overall goal of our research is their bioconversion to value added products (biopesticides, industrial enzymes, biofertilisers, biocontrol agents, bioherbicides, and animal protein) and bioenergy (ethanol, electricity through microbial fuel cell). Moreover, members of our research group are also involved in studying the role of microbial population in carbon recycling. This approach can generate low cost marketable products, sequester carbon, and minimize greenhouse gas production. The specific objectives involves isolation, identification of potent microbial strains, study the microbial dynamics in the ongoing bioconversion process, rapid detection of contaminants and pathogens. In order to conduct this research effectively Biolog system is required for rapid identification and biochemical characterization of different microbial strains proliferating in the bioconversion process. The Biolog system will enable the students and researchers to rapidly detect the type of microbial strains and identify their biochemical character and hence valorize their research.

"Cheese whey or lactoserum, by-product of cheese manufacturing, has posed serious disposal problems for many cheese makers. Whey disposal through sewage systems can overload the treatment facilities by its high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD: 30,000 and 60,000 mg/L). A plant discharging 1000 gal of whey to a sewage system creates a load equivalent of more than 1000 domestic users. Thus, there is a need to look for alternate avenues to transform these wastes into value-added products which can manage the wastes as well as simultaneously produce a high value end-product. In this pursuit, the proposed project investigates the use of lactoserum/cheese whey as raw material for production of mixed culture microorganisms and for the development highly enriched protein product. The specific objectives includes: isolation/identification of microbial strains involved in the process and optimization of various process steps (protein precipitation, fermentation, protein recovery) to increase the yield of the protein and to eliminate all live microorganisms from the final dried product. This is an advantageous and green approach. The project shall be carried in collaboration with Corporation HET, a company which is actively involved in the research and the successful completion of the project will result in understanding complete know-how of the technology of biotransformation of cheese whey leading to efficacious and economic protein product ready for use as animal feed. The project will provide an opportunity to train HQP (3 Ph.D. students, one post doc and a research associate).","Production of animal feed (Base L ) from cheese whey","Waste, waste management and recycling",CANADA,CANADA,"Biochemical engineering"

"Many aspects of our research address the synthesis of carbon-rich materials for the emerging field of photonics, the technology of using light to acquire, store, transmit, and process information. This is a rapidly developing area that has the potential to do for this century what electronics has done in the past. The photonics revolution is driven by the ability of light to carry information faster and more efficiently than electricity. Central to the success of photonics are the organic molecules that can be used in devices to manipulate light by altering its frequency, acting as a switch, or otherwise changing its characteristics. 

   A primary aim of this research program is the development of new synthetic methods for the realization of more efficient materials based on organic and organometallic compounds.  These compounds are particularly attractive due to their ability to manipulate light, low cost preparation, and facile processability.  Our synthetic methods allow for the preparation of a range of materials designed to feature nonlinear optical (NLO), liquid crystalline, and luminescent properties. With slight modifications, these methods will allow a controlled, step-wise synthesis of conjugated ""molecular wires"" and macrocycles with defined structure.  Our efforts are also directed toward the synthesis of molecular carbon allotropes and carbon-rich, nanometer-sized structures. It is often true that the performance of a material is intimately linked to its order in the solid-state.  To this end, we also explore self-assembly processes, where nanoscale structures can be constructed from small building blocks based on predictable behavior engineered at the atomic level. All of these new materials promise to provide new avenues of fundamental discovery at the interface of organic synthesis and materials science.

   Finally, an interesting twist to our synthetic methods has also allowed for us to explore the formation of carbon-rich polyynes that are found naturally in sources as common as garden vegetables (e.g., carrots) and as obscure as bacterial cultures. Naturally occurring polyynes feature a wide range of biological properties, some of which we are currently exploring.

"Dr. Tyree (as well as others independently) has developed quantitative models that predict how hydraulic conductivity of trees impacts the photosynthetic process and hence the rate of tree growth. But more discovery oriented research needs to be done to validate and improve the predictive capacity of the model.



There is increasing evidence that the efficiency of water transport (hydraulic conductance) in soils and in roots, stems and leaves of trees sets limits on tree performance: transpiration, carbon gain and growth-rate of trees. Furthermore, there is evidence of a strong negative-impact of drought events and freeze-thaw cycles on the efficiency of water transport and hence tree productivity and survival. More recently, it has become clear that plants have dynamic control over root and leaf hydraulic conductance through gene expression for aquaporins, which are proteins that reside in cell membranes and which enhance water transport in trees. 



The purpose of the research program in this NSERC Discovery Grant is to critically analyze hydraulic architecture of Canada's most widespread trees, poplars, aspens and cottonwoods. The studies will investigate root and shoot components of water transport, including xylem structure and function and aquaporins, with particular emphasis on prospective adaptations to drought and cold. These water relations characteristics will be compared with those of tropical trees that are being investigated in ongoing studies. The research will reveal fundamental aspects of tree ecophysiology and adaptation to cold-temperate climates, and address the broader question, 'how are trees uniquely adapted to different biophysical ecoregions?'. 



A secondary intent is to transfer the knowledge base gained to potential commercial exploitation in sustainable forestry practices and agro-forestry.

"Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is an emerging area of multimedia research dealing with the analysis and retrieval of music in digital form. The proposed research program is focused on improving the state-of-the-art in MIR algorithms for processing audio signals using ideas from sound source separation. In the past few years there has been steady progress in various topics of audio MIR such as genre/style/mood/artist classification, segmentation, summarization and similarity retrieval. In the majority of existing algorithms the audio signal is represented statistically without any effort to identify and characterize individual sound sources. 



The main objective of the proposed research is to explore how sound source separation and music transcription techniques can be used to aid large scale MIR problems such as classification and similarity retrieval. 

As an example the characteristics of the singing voice play an important role in how we characterize/perceive a piece of music. Using sound source separation techniques the singing voice part of a music mixture can be enhanced and characterized individually. This information can then be combined with other more ""classic"" audio features for classification or similarity retrieval. We hope that the shift to large data collections from isolated examples will suggest insights and improvements to existing source approaches and inspire new ones. 



MIR is one of the most important emerging areas of multimedia information retrieval. The success of portable music players and online music stores indicates the large impact that MIR can have. In addition to commercial applications, improvements in MIR systems can lead to advances in music libraries, pedagogy and preservation of culture. The proposed research has the potential to improve existing sound source separation approaches and therefore make human/computer communication more effective.

"It is the overall objective to attempt to develop an extrusion process for the production of very fine fibers and powders from polymer melts saturated with supercritical carbon dioxide. Ingenia Polymers provides size reduction services as part of their Primary Producer Division. As leaders in thermoplastic grinding, Ingenia can produce a full range of powders demanded by the customers' applications in roto-molding, powder coating, compounding and dispersions. Particle size distribution and morphology are precisely controlled using proprietary technology and know-how to optimize product performance. This project will enable Ingenia Polymers to continue to explore the innovative use of supercritical carbon dioxide in extrusion/compounding operations for the purpose of developing a low energy process for the production of micronized polymeric compounds and powders for various tiered automotive suppliers. These micronized powders can be converted to a variety of engineered automotive plastics components. Another automotive application is in the area of ""slush"" molding which is a process very similar to rotational molding which requires powdered polymers. The technology being developed will allow for the use of a wider variety of polymeric materials than what is currently possible. Also, fibrous material produced with this technology can find applications in the automotive area due to their filtering and absorbing properties.","Polymer micronization through extrusion with supercritical fluids","Polymers, rubber and plastics",CANADA,CANADA,"Polymers and coatings"
"Extrusion is a very important polymer processing operation. Conventional extrusion involves melting, homogenizing and shaping of polymeric materials into continuous final plastic products such as films and fibres. Reactive extrusion combines the previously mentioned operations with reaction(s) in the molten polymer for the purpose of producing new materials with enhanced properties. Typical applications involve reactive blending, addition of functional groups on otherwise inert polymers, and modification of molecular weight and structure. Each operation is governed by underlying interactions between material properties and processing conditions. The main thrust in the proposed research program is the  fundamental understanding of these interactions in industrially important reactive and conventional polymer processing operations.

Understanding of these complex phenomena can lead to optimal design and operation of advanced polymer extrusion processes for the purpose of producing novel polymeric materials/structures with enhanced properties. The objective of the research work proposed in this application is to study : (i) reactive extrusion operations for the chemical modification and upgrade of polymeric materials, (ii) novel conventional and reactive extrusion operations employing supercritical fluids, (iii) mixing phenomena in polymer extrusion, and ( iv) advanced film extrusion operations. As a result of these studies, mechanistic process models will be developed to relate application properties to processing conditions. The outcome of the proposed research plan will benefit polymer resin manufactures, plastics processors, and processing equipment manufacturers. It will advance our knowledge in the area of polymer processing/manufacturing technology and more specifically in the important sectors of reactive polymer extrusion, polymer blending and polymer extrusion with supercritical fluids . Such knowledge will boost the competitiveness of the Canadian industry by helping in the evolution of technology related to polymer chemical modification, mixing, and polymer compatibilization, elements deemed crucial by the industry for the next phase of technical and market development in plastics.

"The main criteria of high performance industrial drives (HPIDs) utilized for robotics, rolling mills, electric vehicles, spindle drives, traction drives, high precision machine tools, etc. are: fast and accurate speed response, smooth and quick recovery of speed from any disturbance. Over the years, fixed gain proportional-integral and proportional-integral-derivative controllers and their adaptive versions have been widely utilized for variable speed drives. These schemes have inherent disadvantages as the designs of these controllers depend on exact mathematical model of the system. Furthermore, the fixed gain controllers are sensitive to system uncertainties. 

   The ac motor model is often complex and nonlinear as the parameter varies widely with operating conditions. In order to deal with the nonlinearities and uncertainties of electric motors and overcome the limitations of the existing controllers in recent years, artificial intelligent algorithms (AIA) such as fuzzy logic (FL), artificial neural network (ANN), neuro-fuzzy and genetic algorithm (GA) have emerged as one of the most active and fruitful research areas in HPID systems. Simplicity and less intensive mathematical design requirements are the main features of AIA. Despite tremendous research in this area, industries are still reluctant to apply AIA for real-time industrial drives due to the lack of their systematic development and the high computational burden. 

   Due to growing global concern over energy consumption and the environment, high energy efficiency has become another important factor for HPIDs. The existing loss minimization scheme for motor drive is developed based on motor model which is not capable of handling system uncertainties. 

   The objectives of the proposed project are to develop and implement hybrid intelligent controllers utilizing the merits of FL, ANN and GA in order to achieve high performance and high efficiency of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor and induction motor drives.

"Through recent initiatives, many European countries made commitments to reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions from their residential sectors by improving electricity use and energy efficiency through demand side technological interventions. For example, the German government has a plan to upgrade all pre-1984 homes to contemporary new-build energy standards over a 20-year period. Although a high per-capita energy consumer, Canada has yet to develop a plan to reduce the energy consumption and GHG emissions from its residential sector, which is the third largest energy consuming sector responsible for about 17% of the national energy consumption and 16% of GHG emissions. 

   The objective of the proposed research is to advance and expand the applicant's work on developing comprehensive techno-economic modeling tools to assess and identify feasible options for reducing the energy consumption and GHG emissions in the Canadian residential sector. Through this work, two new techno-economic tools will be developed: (1) A new end-use energy and emissions model for the Canadian multi-family housing stock, and (2) Models for micro (<10 kW, for single-family housing) and medium (10-30 kW, for multi-family housing) scale internal combustion engine, Stirling engine and fuel cell based cogeneration systems. These models will include thermal and electrical storage, and will be capable of optimizing storage device and system capacities under a variety of dispatch, as well as time-of-use and flat tariff scenarios to minimize site and utility level GHG emissions, and operating and levelized cost.

   The resulting models will be used to conduct a range of what-if studies to seek and identify strategies capable of reducing the energy consumption and GHG emissions in the residential sector while maintaining the thermal comfort, health and economic well being of Canadians. The model will be made available in the public domain to allow policy makers, researchers and energy engineers to conduct further what-if studies to develop and evaluate strategies for reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions in the Canadian residential sector.

"The innate immunity is an ancient mechanism serving to rapidly detect invading microorganisms and to initiate host defense. The body has a wide array of cellular receptors to recognize ""the danger signals"", i.e. some molecular structures typical for various microorganisms. Such recognition will signal the body that there is a danger of a damage or disease. I hypothesize that integrins which are present on the surface of epithelial cells in the lungs serve as receptors to recognize potentially harmful structures, for example, products by pathogenic bacteria. Integrins can then initiate signaling mechanisms that will modify cellular functions to ensure the proper response to the invaders. In this project, I plan to investigate molecular mechanisms of integrin function as pattern recognition receptors. I intend to understand how integrins contribute to the innate immune defense of the body, in particular, how they can help to fight some  diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria. The results of my studies will be important for better understanding of mechanisms of innate immunity which are fundamental in host defense against pathogenic microorganisms.

"The new security challenges of the 21st century are qualitatively different than in the past, as new networked organizational structure of threatening parties-with many groups actually being leaderless-and their quickness in coming together in swarming attacks requires more dynamic collaborative approaches to counteracting measures. To confront this new type of conflict, it is crucial for governments and governmental organizations, military, and law enforcement as well as non-government organizations to begin networking themselves. Response shall encompass harmonious inter-organizational coordination across a holistic security ecosystem to achieve a total effect greater than the sum of the individual parts. The development of concepts such as network-enabled operations open new possibilities to deploy units or teams as agile groupings - which we refer to as SOS - Self-Organizing Security - networks. SOS networks are capable of highly adaptive Command and Control founded on collaborative distributed working skills. SOS networks brings agility via the NEOps

communications backbone - to facilitate a common information environment that would allow people, sensors and systems to be dynamically grouped or configured according to particular mission requirements. The aim of this strategic project is to develop a template SOS network operational mechanism as a resilient architectural foundation for the deployment of dynamic, short lived emergency response organizations capable to react quickly to emerging crisis situations. The SOS network will balance micromanagement of subordinates with the excessive independence of commanders based on a trusted overall operational picture shared via the communications backbone. Hints towards a 'change of culture' evolving first responders operations from the traditional hierarchical towards a 'power to the edge' heterarchy will point to policy changes to enable emerging leaders to take action in the 'chaos of crisis'. The strategies proposed will increase the responsiveness and

effectiveness of our defense system and by this reduce the vulnerabilities to asymmetric threats increasing the safety of Canadians in today's convoluted world dynamics.","Enabling the SOS (Self-Organizing Security) Network","Communication systems and services (planning, organization, services)",CANADA,CANADA,Complexity
"How to craft the nervous system of our eNetworked world to enable seamless evolution through challenging times and adaptation not only to meet the unexpected and survive it, but thrive on it? Recognizing the fundamental limitations of engineering in dealing with highly complex systems, we frontally approach the radical shift of paradigm, brought by the ubiquity of computing and communication environments that link systems and people in unprecedented ways via eNetworks. One major characteristic of these new technological developments, termed here Cyber-Physical Ecosystems (CPE) - is that, given their very nature, they cannot be a-priori defined - but rather emerge from the interactions between individual components, interactions facilitated by the eNetworks. This challenges the traditional mainstream engineering school of thought in its very core in disruptive ways. In essence, the traditional active role of the designer in crafting the organizational, systems and software blueprint 'with the end in mind', namely by a-priory defining the system and its performance requirements following a hierarchical, 'top-down' linear thinking is being fundamentally challenged by the emergent behavior of eNetworked CPE which demand the designer to rather take the passive role of observer in the process of 'self-design' by which the system emerges its organizational structure resulted from the interactions between a myriad of elementary components. We aim to unravel an 'eNetwork DNA' and put it to work similarly to how DNA molds the fundamental cells in natural systems such that they can evolve to accommodate gradual or abrupt change in the environment or internal operating conditions. The aimed at new science of emergent engineering opens the perspective towards a wide range of applications critical today, including: disaster response through deployment of holistic security ecosystems, green electricity generation and distribution, pandemic mitigation, networked transportation and manufacturing, environmental monitoring and sustainability assessment.","Emergent engineering: design of evolvable architectures for large scale enetworked systems","Information and communication services",CANADA,CANADA,Complexity

"The oil sands industry presently produces 400 million barrels of oil annually; each barrel is accompanied by 1.25 m3 of tailings. Tailings and associated process-affected water are stored and disposed of in constructed out-of-pit tailings ponds. One of the major threats from tailings ponds is the migration of pollutants into the groundwater system. A University of Alberta research program funded by Suncor began in 2006 to quantify the extent of this impact, and assess chemical oxidation as a remediation option. This NSERC Discovery Program provides the opportunity to undertake a higher risk approach by examining the feasibility of bioremediation, the use of indigenous microorganisms to transform contaminants to non-harmful end products, as an alternate remediation option.



The primary objective of this Discovery Program is to investigate how the in-situ microbial communities change and interact with process-affected water as it infiltrates into the subsurface. To understand the microbial community response I propose to use microcosm studies and molecular biological methods that are based on the analysis and differentiation of microbial DNA. The research site will be screened prior to, during and after process-affected water contamination to adequately document the shift in the microbial community.    



The short term results of this work will provide information on: 1) the ability of intrinsic microorganisms to degrade process-affected water contaminants; 2) biomass input constraints critical to more accurate modelling of natural attenuation in the region; and 3) the application and benefits of using molecular biology tools (i.e. microarrays) specifically tailored to the oil sands industry to screen contaminated sites for intrinsic bioremediation. This research program in the longer term will contribute towards the reduction of negative ecological impacts associated with the use and storage of water by the oil sands industry.

"The interior of our Earth is, essentially, unavailable to direct observation. With the exception of information that is available from instrumentation that is placed in deep, exceedingly expensive wells, our information is always derived in indirect fashion, for example, by means of active surface seismic sources, passive sources, such as earthquakes, and non seismic techniques, electromagnetic, gravitational and isotopic measurements, to name but a few. The data that we record are, invariably, amplitude variations in time, space or both. The interpretation of the data in terms of Earth parameters entails, basically, three tasks:



[1] Time and/or Space Series Modelling. Before the recorded data may be interpreted, we must envisage a process that can be assumed to have generated them. This step is called modeling. A model is desigened on the basis of experience, intuition and luck. The purpose of this model is to enable us to generate, synthetically, a data set that resembles the one recorded.

[2] Data Processing. The recorded data are always contaminated by some type of noise. This noise may be random, partly deterministic, additive, convolutional, multiplicative and, as generally happens, an unknown mixture of all of the above. The task is to separate signal from noise, so that this signal may be compared with the signal modelled in step [1]. Many other sub-tasks are involved here, such as deconvolution, resolution enhancement etc., but these will be described in the proposal below.

[3] Inversion. Step [1] models the signal in the data in terms of Earth parameters. This is called the ""forward problem"", i.e., assumed parameters >>> data. The desideratum is, however, data >>> parameters. the ""inverse problem"". Centrally important, fascinating and hugely difficult. I will not go into reasons why here. Sufficient be it to pose the following, ""Given the number 12, find two numbers, a and b that, when added together, give 12. An infinity of answers. The question is, is one of these useful, and if so, which one?

"Gene therapy is a powerful approach to treatment of several important diseases since it can address the root cause of the problem rather than alleviate the disease symptoms that are typical with current drugs. For a successful gene therapy procedure, it is necessary to use specific delivery systems so that the genes found in DNA molecules can be expressed by patients' own cells. Using viruses to deliver the genes to the cells is popular, but viruses cause a variety of problems when they are used on patient cells. Using synthetic materials, rather than viruses, is more desirable since they have cause relatively less problems on the cells. However, they are not as effective as viruses when it comes to gene delivery. This project will develop new synthetic delivery systems that will improve the performance of current systems. We will engineer new materials so that they can effectively present the DNA molecules to patients' cells and allow more effective use of the delivered DNA therapeutics. Successful completion of the project will lead to better use of gene therapy in a clinical setting for a wide range of diseases.","Engineering biodegradable polymers for gene delivery","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical materials"

"The focus of my research is on how hormones (endocrine factors) produced from the brain and gut regulate food intake, growth and reproduction in fish.  Food intake is mainly regulated by endocrine factors produced from the brain and gut, while growth and reproduction are regulated by factors produced mainly from the brain, pituitary and gonads (testis/ovary).  Using goldfish, a well-characterized model used to study hormones, I have previously shown that two gut-brain peptides ghrelin and galanin stimulates food intake and secretion of growth hormone (GH; regulates growth) and luteinizing hormone (LH; regulates reproduction) secretion in fish.  I hypothesize that (i) the regulation of feeding, growth and reproduction are interlinked by gut-brain endocrine factors and (ii) the appetite regulatory peptides act directly on the gonads to regulate reproduction.  The overall objective of this proposal is to study how certain endocrine factors integrate food intake, growth and reproduction in fish.  During the term of this grant, I will expand my studies on the biological actions of ghrelin and galanin and identify the structure and functions of two other appetite regulatory factors, galanin like peptide (GALP) and peptide YY (PYY) in goldfish.  Endocrine factors (eg: GALP, PYY) will be administered into the brain or into the stomach cavity and food intake and GH and LH levels in blood will be determined.  Presence of ghrelin, galanin, GALP and PYY in the gonads of goldfish will be determined and their direct effects on gonads will be studied.  I also propose to use zebrafish that genetically lack ghrelin to further characterize the appetite regulatory, growth and reproductive functions of ghrelin in fish.  Collectively, the results of the fundamental studies outlined in this proposal (i) are expected to provide new information that will improve our knowledge about the hormonal regulation of food intake, growth and reproduction in fish and (ii) could be beneficial in aquaculture to promote growth and reproduction of cultured fish.

"One of the fundamental problems facing biology is the question of our origins.  The presence of RNA at the core of the ribosome, the extensive use of nucleotide cofactors and the synthesis of DNA and some amino acids from RNA suggests that RNA and not protein was once the dominant biological catalyst.  This 'RNA World' hypothesis assumes that RNA is capable of all the reactions required to maintain and evolve a 'ribo-organism'.  This proposal will examine two major research questions relevant to understanding the chemistry of early life on this planet.



I. Small molecule catalysis: An early replicating system build from RNA would require the synthesis of nucleotide monomers.  We have therefore focused on understanding the ability of RNA to perform reactions that produce or utilize nucleotides.   By studying these reactions in further detail using kinetic techniques developed in our laboratory together with novel evolutionary methods (such as nonhomologous RNA recombination) we hope to learn how RNA active sites can evolve more efficient catalysis.



II. RNA polymerization: The replication of RNA requires the synthesis of nucleotide monomers which are subsequently polymerized into RNA strands.  Recently we have successfully utilized a novel encapsulated selection technology to select an improved polymerase ribozyme that is able to extend a primer-template complex by at least 20-nt.  Improving the processivity of this polymerase by only one magnitude would have far reaching implications for the study of artificial living systems.  By using a range of selection and molecular engineering techniques we hope to achieve this aim.

"Self-assembling peptide hydrogels, composed of nanofibers with nanoscale dimensions, are becoming recognized as a robust platform for a variety of nanomedicine applications: facilitating axon regeneration, sustaining 3D cellular environment, delivering active proteins and small molecules. Preliminary studies indicate a lack of immune response or initiation of the coagulation cascade to these materials: the mechanisms of which remain unknown. These properties, plus the ability to precisely control the peptide sequence, and thereby incorporate cellular and molecular targeting capabilities, makes self-assembled peptide hydrogels very attractive for nanomedicine applications. However, it remains apparent that the peptide hydrogel interaction with a complex biological milieu has yet to be studied in detail. Through understanding the effects of the peptide composition on gel properties as well as protein interactions, it may be possible to develop these materials for multiple technologies: enzymatically controlled drug delivery, tissue engineering scaffolds to enhance wound healing, high surface area biosensors, cardiovascular grafts,  etc.

"Lack of information concerning the phylogenetic relationships and diversity of fungi is acute, particularly within the Ascomycota, a group that includes the majority of economically important fungi. Ascomycetes have been enumerated and identified from many habitats, but studies documenting their diversity are limited by the selective nature of isolation media and the difficulty of accurately identifying these fungi. Many ascomycetes are not known to form sexual states and are defined on the basis of their asexual spore forms (anamorphs). Anamorphic fungi are typically simple anatomically and thus difficult to identify. Ascomycetes that form no spore stages in pure culture cannot be identified using microscopy-based techniques. However, the limitations of traditional methods for estimating fungal biodiversity and identifying anatomically simple or non-sporulating species can be circumvented by molecular techniques, particularly PCR (polymerase chain reaction) based methods.



The proposed program of research will examine the diversity and systematics of structurally simple, cellulose- and keratin-degrading ascomycetes belonging to the Chaetomiaceae and Onygenales through culturing, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequencing. Study of the diversity of the Onygenales will focus on the members of this order found in arctic soils. Documentation of this fungal community will improve our understanding of arctic fungal biodiversity and result in the discovery and descriptions of new species. Studies aimed at estimating the fungal diversity from poorly inventoried regions in northern Manitoba may also identify habitats in need of protection or provide the impetus for a future total fungal inventory of a single Canadian site or ecozone. The generation of molecular and non-molecular datasets will contribute to efforts to construct more comprehensive phylogenies for the Chaetomiaceae and Onygenales that will ultimately facilitate the discovery and identification of these ascomycetes in complex communities.

"The use of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone antagonists has been suggested to increase terrestrial ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 290-320 nm) by thinning the stratospheric ozone layer. We have shown that the influence of this radiation on weedy species could significantly affect their interactions with associated crops, weedy neighbours, and other components of their biotic environment. I intend to continue this line of work and explore some new but related areas to advance our  understanding of weed ecophysiology in an agroecological context. 

          The overall goal of the research proposed in this application is to improve our understanding of multiple effects of UV-B radiation on weedy species and their various interactions. The research will attempt to determine: (1) if UV-B radiation modifies the size hierarchy of the agricultural weed Chenopodium album (lambsquarters), (2) if UV-B level during seed development influences Cynoglossum officinale (hound's-tongue) seed germination behaviour, which may influence its seed bank dynamics, (3) if UV-B radiation influences the allelopathic influence of Sisymbrium altissimum (tall hedge mustard) on its biotic associates, (4) UV-B radiation influences mycorrizal colonization in selected rangeland weeds and if UV-B susceptible and tolerant species, based on growth and morpholocal responses established earlier, differ in this regard, (5) if UV-B radiation influences carbon transfer between C. officinale and its associated grasses, and if the stage of plant development as well as damage to plants of one species in a mixture by either applying a selective herbicide or clipping influence the source-sink relationship for carbon transfer via mycorrhizal connections.

          This research will improve our understanding of the effect of UV-B radiation on the size hierarchy and reproductive success of weedy species and of the roles of allelopathy and arbascular mycorrhizae in the interaction of weeds with their biotic environment.

"The objectives of the proposed research program are: (i) to determine the unknown and much-needed mass transport properties of various species in heavy oils, and in polymers; and (ii) to develop robust and efficient optimization algorithms to help enhance the performance of chemical engineering processes.

     THE FIRST OBJECTIVE has two initiatives. The first initiative is relevant to the enhanced recovery of heavy oil and bitumen via Vapor Extraction (Vapex), which has emerged as the leading choice due to its energy efficiency and environmental friendliness. At present, there is limited knowledge about the mass transfer properties of various solvents used in Vapex. This initiative will furnish that knowledge by experimentally determining the concentration-dependent dispersion coefficients of various solvents during Vapex. A database will be developed for utilization by reservoir simulators and production engineers to design Vapex implementations optimally. The second initiative is relevant to the effective design of separation and purification processes of polymer production. Chemical residues such as unreacted (co-)monomers, modifiers and solvents pose serious health risks in the use of several polymer products such as baby-bottles and food wraps. It is therefore imperative to produce polymers that are not only cost-effective but also as much pure and safe as possible. This outcome heavily relies on much-needed diffusivity data, which will be generated in this initiative. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE will integrate evolutionary optimization techniques (such as genetic algorithms) with accurate gradient-based methods to deliver robust solutions that are not only independent of initial guesswork but also highly efficient. These strategies will assist in generating effective solutions for the chemical process industry in this age of intensifying market competition, thinner profit margins, and tougher environmental and regulatory standards.

     Last but not least, the proposed research program will provide an excellent platform for the training of highly qualified personnel by actively involving master's and doctorate students.

"My research program aims to add to our basic understanding of poxvirus biology.  Over the years, poxvirus research has been stimulated first by fear of smallpox as a natural pathogen and an agent of biowarfare, second by our ability to use vaccinia virus to eradicate smallpox and potentially other diseases such as HIV/cancer by use of recombinant poxvirus vaccines, and third by the use of poxviruses to probe the molecular workings of eukaryotic cells.  However, despite all this work and the sequencing of more than 100 poxvirus genomes, there are many poxvirus proteins for which very little or nothing is known about their function.

   In the absence of any clues from bioinformatics (computer based analyses) and genetic screens about the function of these ""unknown proteins"", this proposal describes a series of experiments that will identify viral and host proteins that interact with them.  This data will give vital information regarding the biochemical pathways of the poxvirus lifecycle within which these ""unknown proteins"" function.  The primary experiment involves producing modified versions (TAP-tagged) of the poxvirus proteins in virus infected cells, such that the proteins can be easily purified, together with any proteins that they bind to.  Then, the attached proteins will be identified using a very sensitive procedure (mass spectrometry) that can measure the size of fragments of the proteins and match them to protein sequences predicted from genome sequences.  Within this group of ""unknown proteins"", we have also 2 proteins (G5R and G8R) for which we have some bioinformatics clues to function and these wet-lab experiments will provide the next step in their analysis.

   When interacting proteins are identified, we plan on determining the regions of the 2 proteins that are responsible for the interaction.  This involves making deleted versions of the proteins and re-assaying the interactions.  Proteins mutated at specific amino acid positions will also be used to locate the important active sites.

"State-based formalisms such as Finite State Machine (FSM), Extended FSM (EFSM), Communicating FSM (CFSM), State-Charts and their extensions have been widely used to specify the behavior of state-based systems in diverse areas such as, interactive systems, reactive systems, web services, multimedia services, and telecommunications systems as well as to describe the behavior of concurrent and distributed systems. Within this context, the objectives of the proposed research are to develop formal methods for the generation of cost-effective test suites from specifications or requirements of state-based systems and for requirements based regression testing.

"In the area of reverse engineering, much research is being done on capturing the form of an object for inspection and design recovery purposes. When using contemporary reverse engineering techniques to reconstruct an object, many three dimensional data points are collected along the object's surface. Surfaces are constructed from the point cloud data using best-fit polynomial methods. Because of errors (due to scanning and manufacturing techniques, wear, etc.), the point cloud data does not correspond to an ideal replica; therefore, design modifications may be necessary. In addition, the model is incomplete using existing methods unless computer tomography (CT) scans are utilized, which is cost prohibitive, as data collection systems do not readily capture information on recessed or internal features. 

   In order to create a more suitable model for engineered components, a different approach is required. Methods need to be developed to capture all features and critical characteristics. Consequently, it is proposed to develop and test novel data collection, data analysis and model generation techniques for design recovery that overcomes the current shortcomings of existing methods. A controlled, destructive data collection system will be developed to collect the feature data.  Geometry construction tools will be developed to create 'functional geometry' for mechanical components. The digitized data will be used as a template, and undergo a series of transformations in order to create the final model. Once an ideal model is generated for all features of the component of interest, a differences model can be created between the ideal model and the data that has been collected. 

   The form recovery research will be extended to extract macro porosity and voids, dendrites, and then the grain structure, for cast components. Consequently, a comprehensive three dimensional material characteristics map will be created to complement the geometric form model to create a manufacturing design knowledge base to assist with subsequent product and process designs.

"Humanity's most important challenge for the 21st century is the development of renewable and sustainable energy sources. As a complementary step, we must also reduce our energy consumption while new renewable sources are being developed. As light for illumination accounts for ~20% of electricity use, significant gains can be realized by improving the efficiency of light sources. Current light sources suffer from use of toxic mercury or lead (in the case of compact fluorescent bulbs) or high cost and limited scalability (in the case of LEDs). Further improvements - simply, making better light bulbs - is an essential step towards addressing our energy challenges. Group IV Semiconductor Inc. is a Canadian high technology company that is developing new high-efficiency ""light bulbs"" based on light emitting elements or nanocrystals. This technology can generate light more efficiently than conventional bulbs, with significant advantages relative to compact fluorescent and LED technologies. To improve the manufacture of these devices, Group IV Semiconductor Inc. needs to better understand the role of strain in their light emitting materials. This strain affects the performance, lifetime and reliability of these solid state light emitting devices. We will use our strain microscopy to characterize strain in these devices, helping Group IV Semiconductor Inc. to improve their manufacture of these high efficiency light-emitting materials. This project uses the unique skills of the applicant team to develop the analytical tools that Group IV Semiconductor Inc. needs to develop and manufacture better solid state light bulbs. This will significantly enhance the competitive manufacturing of a value-added product that in addition will help address our serious energy resource challenges.","Strain microscopy for process and product optimization of opto-electronic materials","Electrical and electronic machinery and equipment (including computer hardware)",CANADA,CANADA,"Materials structure, properties and testing"

"A first part of my research is devoted to the development and the analysis of efficient numerical methods, based on the finite element method, for the simulation of fluid flows which are interfaced with other types of media such as fluid, solid or porous media. A standard approach for the numerical computations (with the finite element method) is to build a mesh generally composed of triangles or tetrahedra. For the type of physical phenomena we are interested in, some numerical difficulties arise when the real domain has curved boundaries. Even if we can construct a mesh on a computational domain as close to the real domain as desired, the numerical computations do not necessarily tend to the ""real"" solution. 

The second part of my research is devoted to the development and the analysis of stable numerical methods for the synthesis of control laws which are aimed at controlling (suppressing) wave-type propagation phenomena like elastic or acoustic waves. Take a vibrating cable, like an electric cable possibly excited by the wind . The goal is to determine the displacement (the control) of one end of the cable that could suppress these vibrations. Generally, for deriving such control laws with a computer one has to compute a fictional behavior of the cable. While there exists a large number of numerical methods for the simulation of cables, but not all of them will work for the computation of the control law. We are researching these methods or new methods.","Fluid interfaces and numercial control of waves","Modelling and mathematical simulation of natural processes",CANADA,CANADA,"Numerical analysis"

"When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of United States in 2005, it severely damaged the telecommunications infrastructure isolating the area from outside world. With nearly all the high-end emergency communications gear, 911 call centers, cellphone towers, and fixed phone lines being knocked out by the hurricane in its path, HF (high-frequency) amateur radio systems played a critical role in rescue and recovery operations. Subsequent American congressional hearings highlighted the amateur radio response as one of the few examples of what went right in the disaster relief effort. Such tragic incidents have resulted in re-appreciation of the ""good old"" HF technology which has been an essential part of worldwide information transmission since the advent of radio. In this high-tech information age, HF communication continues to be used for a wide range of civilian, government, and military applications as a powerful alternative to a myriad of more sophisticated communication systems. HF systems have been traditionally associated with analog voice and very-low-rate data transmission. With the shift from analog to digital in voice communication and increasing demands for high-rate data transmission (e.g., e-mail, internet, FTP), HF communication has been going through a renaissance. Innovative techniques are required to push the capacity limits of HF band. Our research proposal aims to fill the research gap in this area investigating suitable air interface architectures which will be able to support the challenging expectations in next generation HF communication systems.","Single-carrier and multi-carrier cooperative diversity techniques for next generation HF communication systems","Information, computer and communication technologies",CANADA,CANADA,"Wireless communication systems"

"African trypanososomiasis, caused by several species of the extracellular protozoan parasite belonging to the genus Trypanosoma, is severe and often fatal disease of humans and livestock. Diminazene aceturate (Berenil) is the drug of choice for treatment of African trypanosomiasis in animals. First described in the mid 1950s, a substantial body of data has been generated on various pharmacological aspects of the compound. However, it is not known whether Berenil mediates its anti-parasitic effects exclusively by destroying blood stream forms of the parasite or by combining its trypanocidal activity with immuno-modulatory effects. An additional immuno-modulatory effect seems plausible in view of the fact that certain antimicrobial agents, originally thought to have only anti-microbial effects have now been shown to exert potent immunomodulatory activities. Furthermore, an exclusive trypanolytic activity does not completely explain certain observations in treated animals. For example, parasitemia in cattle treated with Berenil falls sharply to undetectable level within 8 hr post treatment. In contrast, parasites are still detected after 24 hr in blood samples from treated animals that are incubated at 37 oC, strongly suggesting that destruction of parasites is not the only mechanisms of action of the drug. Recently, we found that treatment of infected highly susceptible BALB/c mice with Berenil leads to complete clearance of parasitemia and a concomitant decrease in the production of IFN-gamma and other proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1ï¿½, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-alpha.  We have confirmed that Berenil potently inhibits LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages in vitro. The overarching goal of the studies proposed here is to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of anti-inflammatory properties of Berenil in vitro and in vivo. We believe these studies will elucidate the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of Berenil at the molecular and cellular levels and could also help explain the mechanisms of cellular toxicity of Berenil. In addition, they will provide potential selective targets for Berenil and other related drugs for the purposes of controlling inflammatory processes.

     Proteomics represents an integrated systems biology approach to scientific practice.  This discipline has come to the forefront of biology due to the completion of the human genome and the advancement of key analytical tools such as biological mass spectrometry (MS). High-throughput mass spectrometers (nLC/MS/MS) possessing so called ""nanospray"" ion sources are the workhorse instruments for most proteomic applications due to their ability to rapidly and precisely determine the identity of a large number of biomolecules present in biological samples at sub-femtomole levels. 

     We currently have several projects that require this methodology but lack a system capable of performing nLC/MS/MS proteomic applications.  What is present is an excellent tandem mass spectrometer that would be capable of most proteomic applications if it were upgraded with ""nanoflow"" and ""nanospray"" capabilities.  Therefore, the requested infrastructure includes a system upgrade (hardware and software) to produce a nLC/MS/MS system capable of the latest cutting edge proteomic techniques.   We urgently require the proposed infrastructure for the training goals proposed in Univ. of Windsor's only NSERC CREATE proposal, to accomplish objectives listed in the NSERC Discovery Grants of the applicant and co-applicants, CIHR objectives of the applicant, and for routine mass spectrometry needs of the applicant, co-applicants, and collaborators whose work is funded by NSERC, the Canadian Cancer Society, and the Cancer Research Society.

"Reversible phosphorylation is a protein modification utilized as a ""light switch"" to turn the activity of enzymes on and off.  Proper execution of this process is vital for a vast array of biological events including cellular growth, development, metabolism, and survival.  The kinase and phosphatase enzymes that put on and take off this chemical group must be under tight control in order to achieve cellular organization and avoid promotion of disease states.  Therefore, a major theme of our research program is to learn more about poorly understood kinases and phosphatases predicted to function in critical cellular processes such as cellular growth and survival.

     The current stage of the research program is focused on studying a little known phosphatase enzyme named hYVH1. Interestingly, hYVH1 possesses a unique zinc binding region; the only phosphatase in the human genome that has this capability. YVH1 is expressed in most human tissues and is highly conserved throughout evolution, existing in species as diverse as the malaria parasite, to humans.  However, despite this conservation and being cloned over 16 years ago, very little is known about its biological function. This proposal aims to identify hYVH1 targets, solve its three dimensional structure, and understand how zinc is involved in hYVH1 function.

     Featured heavily in our research program is the analytical technique called biological mass spectrometry and is used as a powerful discovery tool.  We house a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer and perform the mass spectrometry, biochemical, and cell biology experiments all within our laboratory, an advantage that results in expeditious findings and conscientious mass spectrometry efforts.  Furthermore, the opportunity to be trained at this cutting edge biotechnology technique in addition to biochemistry/cell biology methodology has attracted highly qualified graduate students.  Integration of these analytical and cell biology approaches holds great promise for advancing the understanding of how the hYVH1 phosphatase functions in cellular regulation.

"The human placenta acts as a central regulator of maternal and fetal physiology. Although the role of melatonin on fetal development has been the subject of a number of studies, data on its role in placental physiology are scarce.  We have demonstrated that human placenta expresses melatonin receptors. We have also shown the presence and activity of the enzymes responsible for melatonin synthesis and placental melatonin production in placental trophoblast cells. These results strongly suggest an important paracrine, autocrine and/or intracrine role for melatonin and its receptors in placental function and development and, consequently, in pregnancy and fetal health. However, the role of melatonin in placental function and development is still obscure. Thus, our research program aims to elucidate the role and cellular mechanism of melatonin and its receptors in placental endocrine function as well as on trophoblast development. That is, to better understand the role of this trypthophan-derived hormone and its receptors in placental health, and by consequence in pregnancy well-being and fetal development and to develop a new human cellular model to study the regulation and function of melatonin and its receptors on normal and abnormal cellular processes and open the way for new preventive and therapeutic approaches in these areas for variety of disorders including obstetric complications, depression, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.","Placental melatonin system: functions and mechanisms of action","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Cell biology"

"The proposed research is composed of several ongoing projects, under the following two unifying themes. 



1. Measure valued processes and stochastic modeling. What do the three following complex phenomena have in common, in spite of their obvious dissimilarities : the turbulent flow of a fluid, the genetic evolution of a population of bacteria, the fluctuation of the value of a commodity on the financial market? All three can be modeled by nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (or some associated discrete approximation scheme) in the guise of well-posed martingale problems ; and all three can be built, simulated and analyzed via interacting particle systems. My objective for the years to come is the pursuit of my ongoing research projects on the fundamental properties of these systems of particles.



2. Statistical modeling in content-based image searching systems. My goal here is to continue to contribute to the ongoing development of content-based image searching systems used on both image and topographic databases, with a view towards many applications in remote sensing and telecommunications. I plan to incorporate hierarchical structures in the estimation methodology specifically destined for multi-resolution imagery databases ; to identify those mathematical characteristics (to be extracted and indexed) that best suit a framework of multiple comparison tests for the purposes of automatic indexation and retrieval from within such databases; to develop the use, within the imaging community, of many as yet untapped (or sparsely used) statistical resources, in the creation, maintenance and exploitation of content-based image databases and searching systems.

"In 2000, an estimated 6,394,0000 motor vehicle crashes were reported to the police in US. Based on a series of

in-depth investigation of police reports and on-scene investigations, human factors were found to be the

definite cause for 70.7% of the crashes. Most of the accidents in that category could be prevented if there were

proper devices installed in cars that allowed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and

vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) communication. The goal of this project is to create multihop/mesh communication

in a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) using the dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology.

The IEEE 802.11 Task Group ""p"" is currently working towards a standard (802.11p), named Wireless Access

in Vehicular Environment (WAVE), which defines the physical and MAC layer of the communication stack to

satisfy the specific requirements of vehicular communication such as high mobility and fast connection setup.

In this project, we will design and develop a platform for multihop communication in

vehicular networks using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) devices designed by Mark IV

Industries. The DSRC technology uses the IEEE 802.11p WAVE standard to provide vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)

and vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) communications using on-board units (OBU) and road-side units (RSU). OBUs

cooperate to build a wireless communication network on-the-fly. RSUs are used to relay information among

vehicles, transmit public safety messages, and create connectivity to data generated by private content

providers. The present proposal investigates an ad hoc operation mode among vehicles in the absence of

infrastructure.","Multihop/Mesh Communications in Vehicular Networks","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)",CANADA,CANADA,"Communications networks"
"Recently much work has been done to promote voice-activated interactive voice/response (IVR) systems. At the moment, as there is no developed application, the flow of calls are managed off-line to play the appropriate prompts based on the customer interaction with the system. Current voice recognition experiences are limited to the conventional interactive voice/response (IVR) media incorporating automatic speech recognition, statistical language models, and dialog manager technologies. These technologies would have to be revisited to factor in other inputs and technologies to provide a richer, more versatile, and a more robust User Interface (UI) compared to traditional unimodal speech services. Multimodal, multimedia (MM) extension of IVR systems is a natural migration path for offering the opportunity to adapt the customer experience to the actual terminal capabilities of the access device. The proposed research will develop a new generation of virtual agents that are capable of multimodal/multimedia interactions. 



The proposed research activity has two parts that are complementary factors in designing and developing a comprehensive solution to incarnate new generations of interactive avatars that are responsive to multimodal/multimedia communications. The first part of the research encompasses methods and algorithms used as enabler for multimodal user/server interactions. The other part includes all methods and query passings among a set of intelligent multimodal servers. To design the first fragment, we will use recent developments in sparse-space signal processing and develop novel algorithms for feature extraction and design interactive multimodal client/server applications. The second part of the research will be based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking in overlay networks that can deal with a diverse set of substrate network technologies. We will develop a protocol solution, called cross-substrate advertisement,  that can maintain a single overlay network over multiple substrate networks.

"We propose research in user-centric content generation and data fusion using next generation wireless devices equipped with multiple sensors. This project aims to address the fundamental issues for developing generic solutions that use sensory information, combined with new networking and data fusion techniques, to build novel applications for user-generated content creation and processing. Our view to the problem is bottom-up with the sensing performed organically with autonomous uncoordinated sensors that voluntarily collect and report data. This is in contrast to the conventional sensor networks in which sensors -- unless defective -- are expected to participate in data collection. As a result autonomous sensors might produce sparse data sample. Furthermore, in this research we will consider multimodal sensors. In effect, collected data might be in a vector form with each element representing a modality of the signal.  Our project has three main components: sensing, communication, and processing. These three components are chief elements of an intelligent content generation, delivery, and service composition system. We will investigate into data sensing techniques using recent advances in signal processing, namely compressive sensing, and combine it with new wireless communication and networking technologies, and advanced data fusion methods to produce solutions in which data are generated in an organic form by autonomous sensors that may collect and report data. We will also consider units with multiple wireless communication capabilities, such as cellular phone, WiFi, and Bluetooth. Our research will select the best communication means for data gathering and service composition, and reduced cost.

"More recently, industry professionals have started to implement Low Impact Developments (LID) as a way of controlling runoff flow volumes, recharging groundwater and to improve water quality by intercepting and treating runoff at the source. One promising example of an LID is a bioretention cell. These are densely vegetated depressions in the land, commonly placed in parking lots and traffic islands, which capture and treat stormwater runoff. The long term impacts of pollutant loading and its effect on infiltration rates, removal efficiencies and on the bioretention system have not been widely explored. Furthermore, there has been little research into seasonal effects on bioretention performance, especially the efficiency during cold periods and during freeze-thaw cycles that are dominant in parts of Canada. This research will determine the efficacy of bioretention cells for attenuating stormwater hydrographs during spring freshet, during the summer, and during freeze-up in fall months; and determine the efficacy of these cells for removing total suspended solids (TSS), for leaching or retaining phosphorus, nitrogen (in its various forms), and chloride ions from the outlet of the system over seasonal conditions. The information will be disseminated to municipalities charged with stormwater mitigation in both cold and temperate climates. This will help them to provide better and more cost-effective LID designs.","Bioretention cell efficacy in a cold climate",Water,CANADA,CANADA,"Hydrologic engineering"
"Water scarcity, rapid population growth and increasing urbanization are placing increasing pressures on water supply systems, and this may be further exacerbated by climate change. Thus, water recycling presents an attractive option for augmenting water supplies. Stormwater recycling as irrigation water for public lands presents a potential solution but this water can contain pollutants that are harmful to human health if exposure, particularly for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and small children, to these pollutants occurs during the irrigation process. Stormwater reuse also faces social and economic challenges, which may be affected by a changing climate. This research will determine how stormwater recycling for irrigation can be made environmentally, socially and economically acceptable and lead to the development of guidelines and policies on stormwater reuse for irrigating public lands that are robust and resilient under a changing climate. 

     The research is novel because it will make monitoring of stormwater for recycling less expensive by providing information on the physical relationships between important water quality parameters that are difficult to measure and others that are less expensive to measure. The research will also provide a method for describing the distribution of pollutants that may affect public health from exposure to stormwater in any pond at any time. This will lead to the development of robust public policy and guidelines that effectively and safely address not only the environmental and health issues, but also the socio-economic issues in using stormwater for irrigation.

     The benefits to Canada are enormous as it will reduce strain on water supplies while at the same time reducing the risk to public health, and reducing strain on future infrastructure. Significant cost savings will also be realized while at the same time as achieving greater understanding of how stormwater ponds evolve in terms of water quality and therefore, how to better design pond systems both in current and future conditions.

"Waveguide optics and more precisely optical fibres have had a broad and profound impact on modern society. The exponential growth of bandwidth for the Internet bears witness to the development of a fiberoptic based high-bit-rate telecommunication network. Currently, there is a tremendous need to develop compact and reliable optical sources that will practically extend the realm of photonics to other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically in the long wavelength range where it would find applications in numerous areas, including the biomedical sector (dentistry, surgery), the environment (gas sensing, spectroscopy, laser radars) as well as Defence & Security. Fibre lasers have shown great potential to achieve these application goals. This research program is therefore aimed at developing a new generation of photonic components (primarily fibre lasers) with enhanced properties and extended spectral coverage. It relies on the recent development of femtosecond laser sources capable of inducing permanent structural changes in the physical properties of optical materials, namely glass. Specifically, one of the main objectives of this research program is to develop monolithic (i.e. all-fibre or all-integrated) active and passive photonic devices that will cover wavelength windows that are not accessible with silica-based components, in the visible and the mid-IR to be more precise. To this end, we will use low-phonon energy glasses, such as fluoride (e.g. ZBLAN) and chalcogenide as the materials of choice. Special attention will also be paid to the fundamental issues related to the interaction of dielectric materials with ultrafast laser pulses.

"The field of molecular imaging (MI) is revolutionizing modern medicine and basic biochemical research by making it possible to study the biology of diseases non-invasively in living systems. Utilizing MI and probes, which are chemical compounds that generate signals that are detected by imaging scanners (like an MRI scanner) it is possible to visualize diseases at their genesis and to study the impact of new treatment techniques at a biochemical level rather than simply looking at changes in anatomy. 



Of the MI techniques, radioimaging, which detects the distribution of probes derived from medical isotopes, is receiving increased attention because of its exquisite sensitivity. At the heart of designing the next generation of MI probes for radioimaging methods is the study of the chemistry of medical isotopes. New ways to deliver isotopes to sites of disease and to produce agents quickly and in high purity are needed. To accomplish these goals it is necessary to better understand the chemistry of medical isotopes and to develop new and better ways to link them to targeting vehicles.



The proposed program involves studying a special class of chemical compounds known as carboranes which, through the proposed research, can eventually be adapted for use in developing new radioimaging probes derived from widely used medical isotopes. In parallel, a new technology for performing chemical synthesis known as flow chemistry will be explored as a way to expedite the discovery of new agents and to overcome the serious limitations of existing probe production methods.

"I am interested in various problems at the intersection of dimension theory, geometric topology and general topology.



The extension theory was developed during the last fifteen years. The major results in this theory are mainly due to Dranishnikov, Dydak and Scepin. The extension theory provides a unification of the covering and cohomological dimensions,  as well as a new  perspective for obtaining  more powerful techniques in dimension theory.  It is a challenging area since it requires a combination of methods from geometric topology, general topology and homology theory. One of the major problems in extension theory is whether there exists a universal space for the class of all metric compacta of a given extension dimension. Another one is about the validity of the Dranishnikov-Dydak extensivity criterion for some classes of infinite-dimensional spaces.  Developing methods to address these two problems is one of the objectives of this proposal.



Another objective is the study of common properties of finite-dimensional metric homogeneous continua and Euclidean manifolds. This is motivated by the well known Bing-Borsuk conjecture stating that any absolute neighborhood  homogeneous retract of a finite dimension is an Euclidean manifold.  Our recent result with Karasev and Krupski that finite-dimensional homogeneous continua have the strong Cantor manifold property (a property which is possessed by Euclidean manifolds) provides another motivation  for studying homogeneous  spaces.



Continuous selections of multi-valued maps and  their applications in dimension theory is also a proposed area of research.  A number of my results in dimension and extension theory are based on selection theorems. 



This is a theoretical research and the anticipated results would improve our knowledge in mathematics, specially in topology.

"The observation that species richness is not distributed uniformly among lineages or geographical localities has intrigued biologists for over a century. The exact mechanisms by which these imbalances in diversity manifest themselves, however, remain elusive. My research interests lie in exploring the ecological and evolutionary processes that have shaped diversity in the flowering plants. Through past research I have contributed to our understanding of the role of specific traits, such as mating system and pollination modes, in altering speciation and extinction rates. In addition, my work has introduced the idea that diversifying natural selection to reduce competition for pollination increases as the number of coflowering species increases, and this in turn creates increased pressure for future speciation. 



In the next stage of my research I will gather empirical data on the role of pollinators and mating systems in angiosperm diversification by examining selection pressures on mating systems in response to other species in the community and then investigate whether the evolution of different mating systems reduces gene flow between incipient sub-species. Furthermore, I will gather empirical estimates of how increases in the numbers of coflowering species influence the reproductive success of a focal species. Finally, I will use phylogenetic comparative methods to obtain global estimates of the extent to which pollinator specialization has influenced speciation and extinction. In summary, the goal of my research is to understand processes that promote diversification in floral traits, species coexistence, and ultimately, differences in species richness.

"My research program aims to characterize the feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes in determining distributions and coexistence patterns of interacting species. Specifically, we propose to: increase our knowledge of the (i) relatedness of, and ecological interactions among, predaceous diving beetle species, and (ii) ecology, morphology, and historical patterns of spread of freshwater populations of prickly sculpin, in western Canada. To achieve these goals, we will combine field surveys, experimental manipulations, and molecular sequencing and reconstruction of species relationships. We will work in two main areas:



1. Relatedness among species and community structure - This area of research aims to further develop predaceous diving beetles as a system for studying patterns and processes of phylogenetic community structure. We know little about the historical constraints and contemporary ecological interactions that determine coexistence of species in this important group of aquatic species. To do this, we will sample populations of diving beetles in western Canada, from the BC coast to the interior of Alberta. We will sequence DNA of 55 species, and study their interactions in various populations throughout this range.



2. Historical spread and among-population differentiation - This area of research will contrast historical constraints with local adaptation in an intermediate trophic level species, the prickly sculpin, found in lakes that vary in potential prey (e.g., predaceous diving beetles), competitors (e.g., threespine stickleback) and predators (e.g., cutthroat trout). To do this, we will sample inland and coastal freshwater populations of prickly sculpin throughout BC. We will sequence DNA from a number of populations, and study the ecology of these populations as a function of the other species coexisting with them.

"Sustainable agricultural systems will be of increasing importance as world population and affluence increases, and the demands on agriculture increase. These systems must be holistic and reflect an understanding of the complete dynamics of the system. Weed management remains a key challenge and the greatest expenditures on pesticides in Canada by far are expenditures on herbicides for weed management. The ability of weeds to invade, proliferate and interfere poses a major threat to agro-ecosystem productivity and sustainability. Recruitment refers to the successful germination of seeds and emergence of seedlings. For common weed species, successful invasion, interference and proliferation is determined to a great extent by successful seedling recruitment. The purpose of this research program is to work to gain a better fundamental understanding of weed recruitment. If we understand recruitment we can devise means for limiting the success of problematic weeds. This is important for agriculture but also for the conservation and restoration of natural and semi-natural habitats which are commonly threatened by invasive weedy species. In addition, genes (traits) can move from crop to crop via weedy populations of crops species. Understanding the recruitment biology of weedy crop populations can facilitate their management, help prevent crop to crop gene (trait) movement, and facilitate the segregation of GM and non-GM crops and the successful confinement of novel traits (including industrial and pharmaceutical traits) away from food and feed crops to help ensure food safety.","Characterizing the recruitment biology of weeds",Agriculture,CANADA,CANADA,"Crop and pasture production,breeding"

"Constraint programming is a powerful framework for solving difficult problems. In the constraint programming methodology, one models a problem by stating constraints on acceptable solutions. Once a model has been formulated, various algorithms---usually based on search---are available for solving the model. There are many interesting tasks for which this approach is particularly suited. These tasks range from ones that are simple for humans, such as vision and language comprehension, to ones that are difficult for humans, such as scheduling and planning. What these tasks have in common is that constraints are a natural part of the problem. A good example is scheduling people or machines. What is readily available are constraints such as a worker is only available for certain parts of the week or only able to do certain jobs.



I propose constraint programming research projects that fall within the solving stage. A key to improving many applications of constraint programming is to improve the underlying search algorithms. Much progress has been made recently, but more work remains to be done. I propose several projects for improving backtracking search, the most commonly used form of search for solving constraint models, as well as a project investigating an alternative to backtracking search. In addition to this more theoretical and experimental work, I propose to continue an application-driven research project on effectively solving real-world optimization problems. Focusing on applications has had the benefit of identifying shortcomings in existing constraint programming approaches as well as making a contribution to the practice of constraint programming.

"Probabilistic transition systems can be exploited to model randomized algorithms, systems that interact with physical devices, etc. I plan to study probabilistic transition systems and variations thereof.  In particular, I plan to develop quantitative models of these systems.  Such quantitative models are more robust than qualitative models, since minor variations in the probabilities have little effect on the former type of model whereas they may have drastic effects on the latter type.  Also, I aim to develop verification algorithms for these systems based on the developed models.

                                                                                

Java is the most used programming language these days.  Numerous verification tools have been developed for Java.  Java PathFinder, JPF for short, is such a tool.  JPF can check numerous properties of Java programs, like uncaught exceptions, integer overflow and deadlocks.  JPF has been designed in such a way that it can easily be extended.  I plan to improve and extend JPF.

                                                                                

The business process execution language for web services, BPEL for short, is the de-facto standard to program web service compositions.  Various verification tools have been developed for BPEL.  With my students, I also developed some.  All existing tools work with models of the business process, rather than the BPEL code itself.  My plan is to develop a verification tool, along the lines of JPF, that works directly with the BPEL code and, hence, will detect different errors than all existing tools.

"The main thrust of my research over much of my career has been to produce stellar models that satisfy observational constraints as tightly as possible - focusing primarily on main-sequence and giant-branch stars.  Indeed, additional work on these phases will be carried out in the near term.  For instance, the impact on the predicted temperature scale of using model atmospheres as boundary conditions for the stellar interior models will be examined in collaboration with B. Gustafsson's Uppsala group.  In addition, isochrones applicable to metal-poor stars that take diffusive processes into account will be computed in collaboration with colleagues at the U. of Montreal.  However, the main goal of my research over the next several years is to extend the published grids to include the horizontal-branch (HB) and asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) phases, so that University of Victoria stellar models may be used to study complex stellar populations.  Initially these models will be applied to globular star clusters to try to obtain an improved understanding of the so-called ""second-parameter problem"" (the unknown cause of the wide diversity in HB morphology encompassed by clusters having very similar metallicities), and to refine current estimates of the cluster helium abundances.  Moreover, the pulsational characteristics of the models will be computed using a code provided by G. Fontaine, in order to make use of the constraints provided by the cluster RR Lyrae variables.  To generate AGB models much more efficiently than existing programs (by about a factor of 5), a hybrid code will be set up having a Lagrangian mode to follow the evolution, nucleosynthesis, and mixing during He shell flashes in considerable detail (using techniques developed by F. Herwig), as well as a non-Lagrangian mode (i.e., the method of solving the stellar structure equations developed by P. Eggleton) to follow the evolution of thin nuclear-burning shells between consective shell flashes.

"Canada's freshwater aquaculture benefits from many competitive advantages (i.e., plentiful water supplies and low cost energy, industry experience and expertise; substantial export potential related to increasing global demand for fish products, etc.) that, in the past few years, enabled the industry an annual growth exceeding 10% and the injection of billion dollars into the Canadian economy. The expansion of the Canadian freshwater aquaculture sector is however highly dependent upon the development of knowledge, technologies and practices to address and resolve many challenges. 



    One of those challenges is to development alternate species culture and industry species diversification options on a small number of promising species that are biologically and economically capable of achieving commercial success within the next five years As such, sturgeon has been ranked by stakeholders as the second most preferred species. The expansion of the sturgeon culture is however difficult because of the current need for reproductive technologies related to sex maturation and early sex differentiation. 



    As first step in this process, we propose to hold a workshop aiming to bring together national and international experts in order to organize R&D efforts to address specific problems related to the need for reproductive technologies in sturgeon. We are working with a consortium of all of the current Canadian caviar producers as industry partners to assist in the identification of precise R&D issues and will work with them to develop specific R&D initiatives with academic partners.

"The proposed research project looks to find an innovative solution to the problem of the escape of farm-raised to fish. Over the past decade, fish escape from net pens has become highly politicized due to the concern that the escaped domestic fish may cause negative ecological impacts on wild fish stocks by out-competing for food and has a source of genetic pollution as a result of interbreeding with natural populations. The project will develop a line of transgenic fish expressing a specific factor that causes an increased requirement for a specific nutrient. Under artificial feeding regimes, the requirement for this nutrient will be covered. In the event offish escape, the escaped fish would be unable to survive due to the fact that the specific nutrient under question would not be found at high enough levels in the fish's natural prey. As a result of nutrient deficiency, escaped fish would lose condition, become anorexic, fail to reproduce and eventually die. The specific objectives of the project are 1) evaluate specific genetic constructs permitting an increase in specific nutrient requirement; 2) verify the ability of a model fish species to appropriately express selected gene construct; 3) validate the ability of nutritional manipulations to overcome higher levels of specific nutrient requirements. This project will open the door to the development of an innovative biocontainment strategy for farmed fish species and thus reduce the ecological impact of aquaculture production on wild fish stocks.","BioCage: a novel approach for biological containment of farmed fish",Aquaculture,CANADA,CANADA,"Animal biology"

"According to the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization, disease outbreaks are being increasingly recognized as a significant constraint to aquaculture production and trade, and are affecting economic development of the sector in many countries of the world. Fungal diseases are the second largest cause of mortality in aquaculture, particularly in the cultivation of shellfish and fish species. One of most destructive pathogens and that having the greatest economic impact in freshwater aquaculture sectors is the fungus Saprolegnia parasitica.  Evidence suggests widespread infection in most freshwater fish species; left untreated, saprolegniosis can quickly escalate, resulting in up to 50% mortalities of a given population. New restrictions on the use of chemicals used to prevent and treat fungal infections has lead to the need for new alternative products to control saprolegniosis. The current proposal seeks to apply novel approaches to treat and prevent fungal infections using beneficial microbial cultures and or phytochemicals derived from boreal forest biomass. The identification of novel natural compounds that can be used to treat and/or prevent the transmission of pathogens would provide aquaculture producers additional management approaches for disease prevention and control, and permit the industry to pusue environmentally-sound technologies to permit production ofsafe, healthy products for Canadian consumers.

"The primary structural and enzymatic protein of skeletal muscle is the myosin molecule. The basis of skeletal muscle contraction, and thus movement, is the conversion of chemical energy to mechanical energy by the myosin motor molecule. A key structural element of the myosin molecule is the ""regulatory light chain"" (R-LC).  During muscle activity, the R-LC is chemically modified by the addition of a phosphate ion, an enzymatically regulated process known as  ""myosin R-LC phosphorylation"".  Biochemical studies indicate that myosin R-LC phosphorylation may alter myosin motor properties to enhance muscle force, a phenomenon called ""force potentiation"".  The aim of my long term research program is to understand how, why and when myosin R-LC phosphorylation-mediated force potentiation modifies mechanical and metabolic aspects of how fatigued and/or unfatigued skeletal muscle functions.  To this end we will perform a variety of experiments examining mechanical and metabolic properties of mouse muscle, a common scientific model for this type of work. The special qualities of this work are that we will perform these studies using genetically engineered mice that lack the gene coding for the enzyme that regulates myosin R-LC phosphorylation and which thus do not exhibit myosin R-LC phosphorylation during activity. Use of these ""knockout"" mice will allow us to study muscle activity in the absence of myosin R-LC phosphorylation, a situation that does not normally occur, and thus allow us to unequivocally determine the influence of this event on muscle function. We believe that an integrative approach examining the interaction of myosin R-LC phosphorylation with muscle mechanics, intracellular calcium homeostasis and muscle energetics, in both knockout and normal mice, will provide key insights into the physiological role and mechanism of action of myosin R-LC phosphorylation for skeletal muscle function.  This type of information is vitally important because there is much current interest in how myosin R-LC phosphorylation modulates performance of healthy and diseased human skeletal muscle, and our work will provide important new directions for future work in this area.

"The Athabasca Oil Sands of Northern Alberta supplies about 25% of Canada's petroleum needs. This output is expected to quintuple by 2030 at which time the oil sands will be producing 20% of the North American oil consumption. Conventional surface oil sands mining and extraction produces large volumes of tailings and process affected water that, under the zero-discharge policy of the industry, must be safely incorporated into a reclaimed landscape. As a significant proportion of this landscape may be aquatic habitat, the industry has supported an ongoing research program to investigate potential impacts on biota and to develop biological tools to support environmental monitoring of reclaimed ecosystems. Waters in reclaimed systems may in general be influenced by chemicals leaching off of exposed lean oil sand material used in reclamation. Biota may also be exposed in end-pit lakes constructed on the final landscape. End-pit lakes are a reclamation option wherein tailings will form the bottom of constructed lakes on the oil sands leases. Studies conducted in experimental lakes consisting of water-capped oil sands tailings, or lakes in lean oil sands watersheds have shown the potential for increased susceptibility of fishes to opportunistic disease organisms. The central objective of this research is to develop monitoring tools for native fish species in order to predict alterations in the immune system of fishes that may eventually lead to increased disease susceptibility. The study will follow the course of disease over time in the experimental ponds in order to learn the seasonality of the infections and determine whether recovery or adaptation occurs. Parallel  laboratory studies using both rainbow trout and perch will also be conducted in order to examine how well trout responses will predict perch responses and subsequently determine the mechanism and causes of process waters-influence on immune dysfunction. This research will inform management decisions and monitoring options in oil sands reclamation.

"There has been a recent and emerging research focus on the environmental impacts of drugs, hormones and their mimics in the environment. Such compounds are characterized by their high potency, generally low concentration, and the ability to impact specific developmental stages of organisms, sometimes with multi-generational effects. Compounds that mimic or interfere with male sex hormones, or androgens have recently been observed in the environment associated with pesticides, veterinary remedies and complex effluents such as those from municipal sewage and pulp and paper mills. There are aspects of the natural function of androgens that are specific to fishes and this may make fishes more or less susceptible to the effects of androgens in the environment than either birds or mammals. For this reason, it is important to specifically examine the potency of environmental androgens in fishes. Fishes are very diverse and also appear to exhibit a wide range of species sensitivity to the effects of androgens. Thus, it is also vital to understand which species may be most at risk from environmental androgens. This research will explore the basis of species sensitivity to environmental androgens through the examination of the responses of three diverse fish species. This will be conducted at the biochemical level, the level of intact cells, and with intact organisms to fully understand the mechanisms that govern the potency of androgens. Furthermore, models will be constructed to understand the relationship between the chemical structure of molecules and their ability to act as androgens. This research is expected to result in new and fundamental knowledge regarding the potential mechanisms of androgens in the environment and provide the utility of being able to develop models to predict what compounds may pose environmental risk.

"The most common assumption in the study of modern cosmology is that the gravitational field is described by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.  Cosmological models based on this assumption have been very successful in explaining a wide range of observational phenomena. Despite the plethora of strong observational evidence supporting General Relativity, there continues to be significant problems with the widely accepted  Lambda Cold Dark Matter model of the universe.  In this model, both ""Dark Matter"" and ""Dark Energy"" are primary ingredients.  They are added to the model to make it realizable with current observation and do not come out of the model naturally as a prediction.   Furthermore, there are fundamental issues regarding the isotropy and spatial homogeneity assumptions.  The Universe is not homogeneous on all scales, we observe structures, and, therefore, the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy on the largest of scales needs to be questioned.  The question then arises, ""Is there is a more natural way to explain the effects of Dark Matter and Dark Energy?""



A new theory of gravity based on General Relativity, called Macroscopic Gravity, smooths inhomogeneities that may be present in any gravitational field and is, therefore, appropriate for the analysis of large-scale gravitational systems such as the Universe.   Given that there are fundamental problems within cosmological models based on General Relativity, one ought to investigate the appropriateness of using Macroscopic Gravity in those arenas in which classical General Relativity fails in some sense.  We will determine the corresponding system of field equations arising from Macroscopic gravity and will seek solutions to these equations. Where appropriate, the stability of these solutions within a wider class of models will be investigated.  The resulting investigations may yield cosmological models that provide alternative explanations to explain the effects of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.

In undertaking a mutational screening approach to learning and memory, we have taken advantage of the best known multicellular organism, the nematode C.elegans.  C.elegans has proven to be an excellent molecular model for mammalinan (including human) biochemical functions.  We will use the C.elegans learning and memory genes discovered to find their relevant mammalian homologues.  Most important, the C.elegans mutants should allow us to ask if we can separate associative from nonassociative learning, immediate from longer term memory, storage from retrieval, and learning and memory in one sensory modality from those in another sensory modality.

"My aim is to support the audio engineering community with basic research in acoustics, electroacoustics, measurement tools, and signal processing.  It is motivated both by personal curiosity and a genuine desire to help the industry.  This area is multidisciplinary, drawing on physics, mathematics and engineering.  Projects chosen for study derive from contact with prospective graduate students, industry, and personal priorities.

   Completed research is (a) a study of the benefits of a high magnetic field strength (high Bl) on the power efficiency of normal cone loudspeakers, especially the combined benefits of high Bl in combination with switching or class-D amplifiers, (b) a study of the acoustic centre of normal sealed-box monopolar loudspeakers, particularly relevant to understanding how loudspeakers act in rooms, and (c) measurement of acoustic surface impedance with a new, accurate and rapid method.  Newly-proposed loudspeaker research will be chosen from several areas: (i) further work on acoustic surface impedance measurements, (ii) a study of the acoustic nonlinearities that are responsible for the poor performance of concentric speaker systems, involving the acoustics of moving boundaries, and (iii) study of viscoeleastic loudspeaker damping and the inertia of the moving air near the cone.

   For over 20 years a colleague and I have worked on dither, which is the addition of noise to a quantizer to turn its distortion and noise modulation into benign low-level noise.  These studies have influenced the way digital audio has flourished.  Properly dithered systems have infinitely fine signal resolution and no noise modulation, becoming truly analog in their behaviour.  We will apply these same concepts to image processing, extending these studies to different forms of dither in multi-bit image processing as well as partial dithering in low-bit half-toning.

   An ongoing peripheral project is a study of the propagation of acoustic waves in concrete and other civil engineering solids, in order to detect flaws and cracks.

"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have two very important functions: it serves as an eukaryotic model organism in which fundamental processes of eukaryotic cell biology, molecular biology and metabolism can be studied, and it has enormous industrial relevance as it serves to produce bread, wine, beer and bio-ethanol. During beverage and bio-ethanol production this yeast is used to ferment high concentrations of fermentable sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide. These production processes present the yeast with a variety of stresses that ultimately influences its ability to perform fermentations efficiently. Fermentation stresses include an initial high sugar and solute environment (osmotic stress), and increasing ethanol toxicity and nutrient depletion as the fermentation proceeds. Understanding the mechanisms that enable yeast to cope with these stresses will allow us to develop fermentation strategies and yeast strains to enable more efficient fermentations. The conversion of fermentable sugars to ethanol is one of the prime objectives of the fermentation process. Yeast uses a family of 17 hexose transporters (Hxt1-17) to sense it sugar environment and to transport hexose sugars into the cell. The most important transporters during wine fermentations are Hxt1, Hxt3, Hxt5, Hxt6 and Hxt7. Hxt6 and Hxt7 are high affinity transporters that function toward the end of the fermentation when nutrients become limiting. We have shown that the GID/VID genes are needed by the yeast to respond effectively to nutrient depletion, osmotic stress, and, surprisingly, influence the yeast's ability to produce ethanol. The Gid/Vid proteins form a complex, the Vid30c, which are responsible for the regulated internalization and degradation of the Hxt7 in response to changing nutrient conditions. However, the mechanism(s) of function of the Vid30c or its individual components are poorly understood. This proposal is aimed at increasing our understanding of the Vid30c in response to fermentation stresses.

"Title: Novel dendrimers for papermaking applications.

Dendritic macromolecules with tailorable internal and surface structure offer excellent opportunities in designing novel materials for interactions with papermaking suspensions. Professor Kakkar's group has developed a simple synthetic methodology that allows the construction of a variety of globular and dumb-bell shaped dendrimers. The synthesis is flexible using an adaptive template core, and has allowed the build-up of several generations without separation steps in between, making the process easy and cost-effective. These dendrimers contain hydroxyl groups at their periphery that can be used to readily functionalize these dendrimers with entities including carboxyl, amine, sulfonate, aldehyde etc. This allows us to custom design these dendrimers with desired properties. It is proposed to apply these dendrimers to papermaking suspensions, either as part of a dual component retention aid system or as strength agents. The efficiency of such retention aids, the drainage during forming and the strength (wet web, wet and dry strength) of hand sheets will be determined by a number of techniques, including new ones developed by Prof, van de Ven.

The potential benefits for Canada are the introduction of a new product lines in the Canadian Pulp and Paper Industry, consisting of tailor-made dendrimers and highly branched polymers. Canadian companies will be targeted first to implement any new technology arising from this grant, giving them a competitive edge over competitors.

"The Canadian Forest Industry is struggling for its survival. Traditional markets of printing grades, the major part of Canadian Pulp and Paper Production, are dwindling and are unlikely to regain profitability in the future.  For a renewal of the Canadian Forest Industry, revolutionary changes are necessary: switching to more profitable product lines (such as flexible packaging) and creating innovative novel products.

To create technology platforms for developing green products based on wood fibres and wood fiber networks that will replace fossil-fuel based and other non-renewable products.

Novel products that are targeted include flexible food packaging, insulating materials, decorative furniture, textiles, filters, biofoams and fibre-biopolymer composites.

"Objectives: The objective of the proposed research is to increase our understanding of interactions among colloids, polymers and polyelectrolytes, and the self-association and complexation of polymers, polyelectrolytes and other water-soluble substances. These interactions play a key role in many industrial processes and the scientific understanding of these phenomena is at the forefront of colloid, surface and polymer science.

Proposed Research: One of our most exciting discoveries made recently, is the spontaneous self-assembly of alternating copolymers containing phenyl groups. These groups can stack and in this way ""zip"" two molecules together, the phenyl groups acting as the interlocking projections of the zipper. This molecular zipper is different from molecular zippers based on DNA or protein, which function by hydrogen bonding. Further association results in sheets of aligned molecules, also zipped together in the same way. These sheets can roll up and form nanotubes, typically consisting of eight molecules. This form of self-assembly into nanotubes is unique and different from any other self-assembly. This novel self-assembly could open a whole new field of nanostructures made from alternating copolymers, similar to those formed from block copolymers, which are extensively studied. We would like to concentrate our research on this  type of self-assembly, which might have potential applications in the design of electrical nanocircuits , or in controlled release of material trapped in these tubes (e.g. drugs). Other areas of research, dealing with colloid-polymer interactions, on which we plan to work, are polymer transfer from colloids to surfaces and shear-induced polymer bridging and break-up, especially of aggregation by molecular recognition. Polymer transfer can be studied by electrokinetic and fluorescence techniques, which technique can also be used to study flocculation by fluorescent polymers. Electrokinetics and shear-induced flocculation are both subfields of colloidal hydrodynamics, a field pioneered by the applicant.

"Within the target area of Sustainable Energy Systems of the NSERC Strategic Project Grants program, one of

the priorities that NSERC has identified is research on Biomass Conversion and Co-Product Optimization. The

research proposed in this application addresses this topic by focusing on the development of methodology for

the analysis of biodiesel feedstocks, process monitoring and quality assessment of end products based on the

application of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Although biodiesel is commonly viewed as

running engines on waste cooking and vegetable oils, the viscosity of such oils is too high for them to be

effectively atomized by most diesel injector systems. Thus, biodiesel generally consists of fatty acid methyl

esters produced by transesterification of triacylglycerols derived from fats and oils of plant, animal or marine

origin with methanol. A wide variety of sources of triacylglycerols are used for biodiesel production, including

biomass, vegetable oil, tall oil, used cooking oils or rendered fats. Thus, one of the challenges to be met by the

biodiesel industry is to convert highly variable feedstocks into consistent products that meet the performance

standards for biodiesel. In the proposed research program, which will be undertaken in collaboration with a

Canadian lubricant formulation/technology company (Thermal-Lube Inc.) and a major Canadian biodiesel

producer (Rothsay), FTIR methods that the applicant has developed for the analysis of lubricants and edible

oils will be adapted to assess the quality and physicochemical characteristics of both biodiesel feedstocks and

products as well as to monitor the processes that convert one into the other. These new methodologies will be

implemented on automated instrumentation designed by Thermal-Lube and will be evaluated in Rothsay's

biodiesel production facility. The successful completion of this project will support the growth of the emerging

biodiesel sector by providing a rapid, versatile, and cost-effective analytical tool for monitoring biodiesel

production and for quality control of its products. The FTIR methods developed will be proposed to the

American Society of Testing and Materials as new procedures to facilitate meeting biodiesel standards.","Biodiesel process analysis and quality contril by FTIR spectroscopy","Alternative energy resources",CANADA,CANADA,"Fuel and energy technology (economic geology, use 4003)"
"This application addresses fundamental research related to the continued development of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic methods for the analysis of edible oils. Previous work by the applicant has advanced quantitative FTIR analyses of oils to the point where the methodology is making the transition from the basic research laboratory to practical application in food quality control laboratories, with attendant economic and environmental benefits. With the recent acquisition of a research-grade spectrometer combining mid-IR, near-IR, and Raman capabilities (courtesy of an NSERC Research Tools and Equipment Grant), the applicant is in a position to further explore and develop spectroscopic approaches to oil analysis. A major focus of this research will be the development of rapid, automated and cost-effective methodology that the food industry can employ to obtain the nutritional information required for fat on food labels. This methodology will also assist the food industry in addressing the new labeling regulations resulting from concerns about the health effects of trans fat. In addition, spectroscopic techniques will be developed to monitor the complex chemical processes taking place in oils during commercial frying, as these changes impact the quality, safety, and shelf life of fried foods. This exploratory research program is expected to yield results that will be of value not only to the food industry but also to food scientists, analytical chemists, and nutritionists. It will also train graduate students, who will acquire unique knowledge and expertise, as well as research skills for devising workable strategies to solve complex analytical problems. Thus, as in the past, the proposed research will have a fundamental focus, but one which is ultimately directed at delivering practical solutions to some very real analytical problems faced by the food industry, which are also relevant to Canadian consumers.","FTIR spectroscopy of food systems","Agriculture and primary food production",CANADA,CANADA,"Food chemistry and analysis"
"Landscapes are complex dynamic systems, both geomorphologically and ecologically. Moreover, geomorphological processes are influenced by the landscape's vegetation cover and vice versa. Given these mutual relations it can be expected, and indeed it has been shown, that geomorphological and ecological processes interact and co-determine the evolution of the landscape. However, these interactions are frequently neglected in current landscape simulation studies. Geomorphological landscape evolution models commonly regard vegetation as a secondary factor and either treat it as static or ignore it altogether. Conversely, ecological landscape evolution models usually regard the landscape's morphology as a static stage for vegetation competition and succession. 

    )	This research aims to improve understanding of interactions and feedbacks between ecological and geomorphological processes in landscape evolution, using an integrated landscape evolution modelling approach. Two new computational models will be developed to systematically investigate: 1) the internal dynamics of geomorphological and ecological process interactions on both reach and catchment scales; 2) the importance of these interactions on landscape evolution; 3) the impact of vegetation dynamics on rates of geomorphological processes and sediment yield; and 4) the landscape's response to external conditions, such as climate change or anthropogenic forcing.

    )	Field studies are envisaged to complement the numerical simulations. Field data are used to apply the models in natural systems, rather than idealized or hypothetical environments only, and thereby offer the potential for verification or confirmation of the models.

"Mercury is ubiquitous in the global environment, including sensitive receptors such as the Canadian Arctic, and is of concern due to its toxicity, persistence and ability to bio-accumulate and bio-magnify in various food chains.  While some mercury is released into the environment through natural sources such as volcanoes, most of the mercury present in the environment can be attributed to man-made sources such as fossil fuel combustion, waste incineration, and metal processing.  Once the mercury is released into the atmosphere, it undergoes a complex cycle involving transformations, atmospheric transport, and eventual deposition to terrestrial and aquatic surfaces.  Under favourable weather conditions, the mercury can volatilize back into the atmosphere to undergo further long range transport and deposition cycles, thus making mercury a truly global pollutant.  



The proposed research is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the fate mechanisms involved with mercury in its various chemical forms and how mercury moves from one environmental compartment to another.  Compartments of primary interest will be the lower atmosphere, the upper soil surface, and vegetative canopies.  To accomplish this, field experiments are proposed to obtained comprehensive data sets of the behaviour of mercury in the lower atmosphere under different weather conditions as well as over varying seasons.  In addition, the field experiments will be used to validate a mercury exchange model that will be developed as a tool to predict emissions of mercury from soils and vegetative canopies on a regional basis.  The emission inventories that are generated for mercury can then be used by atmospheric modelers to better determine the fate of mercury in the atmosphere.

"The proposed research comprises two intertwined projects that build on previous research, and a third project involving a new line of investigation. The first two projects concern the fine tuning of the synthetic (i.e., artificial) gravity field formulated for the territory of Australia and a simultaneous improvement of the UNB technique (known in geodetic circles as the Stokes-Helmert technique) for geoid computation. Geoid, being the horizontal surface used as a datum for heights in surveying and mapping, is very closely but intricately related to gravity. Thus, a synthetic gravity field can be used for objective and/or blind testing of geoid computation techniques. The International Association of geodesy wishes to conduct such testing to identify a technique to recommend for computing national geoids. Having tested the UNB technique on the Australian synthetic field, the first ever test of its kind, we discovered that there is a bias of 35mm in the results, plus some larger point discrepancies of the peak value of 120mm in the mountains. While the point values are explainable as discretization errors, the bias is too large, if it is associated with the Australian synthetic field, to make the field acceptable as an errorless etalon. Both the synthetic field and the UNB technique require further investigation to reach a level of accuracy of 5mm, and this will be pursued through the proposed research. 



The new project concerns three-dimensional modelling of the viscosity (time dependent response to stress) of the upper mantle of the Earth over Canada using geodetic data (vertical motions, gravity, sea-level records, etc.). Viscosity is related to thermal conditions and more detailed knowledge of 3D viscosity distribution will not only be useful by itself but will also be helpful for studying the thermal flow within the Earth.

"My research focuses on two rather disparate fields, neutron stars and star & planet formation.



Neutron stars are the densest objects known to mankind, with a mass 1.4 times that of the Sun packed in a sphere with only 20 km diameter. They contain, as their name suggests, mostly neutrons, one of the two consituents of atomic nuclei.  Indeed, one could envisage them as giant nuclei, although with a mean density about thrice that of atomic nuclei, and a core density that is higher still.  

We do not know how matter behaves at these densities, being unable to reach such densities in laboratories and not yet smart enough to calculate the behaviour theoretically. As a result, there are different predictions for the properties of neutron stars. My programme aims at testing these predictions, by comparing these with the properties inferred from observations of neutron stars.



We know star and planet formation starts when clouds of interstellar material become gravitationally unstable and collapse.  During the collapse, conservation of angular momentum ensures ever more rapid rotation, causing mass to accrete on the proto-star via a disk.  In the later, calmer stages, dust in this disk can collect into pebbles and then boulders, which presumably are the building blocks of planets.

While this basic picture of star and planet formation is clear, numerous major questions remain.  My programme deals with two parts.  One tries to address why most stars are in binaries or multiple systems, rather than alone.  The other is more technology driven, trying to find ways to detect extrasolar planets directly, so that we can characterise them much better (eventually to look for signatures of life). For this part, I'm particularly excited about trying this on a relatively short timescale, using a balloon-borne ""planetfinder.""

"The gastrointestinal tract of animals is colonized by an abundant and diverse community of normal non-pathogenic bacteria which have both beneficial and detrimental effects on their host. Examples of benefits to the host include exclusion of pathogens and synthesis of essential vitamins. Detrimental effects on the host include microbial fermentation or competition for certain selected nutrients, increasing the requirement for certain nutrients and reducing digestive and absorptive capacity. In poultry, the largest bacterial populations are found in the crop, an out pouching of the oesophagus in the upper tract and in paired blind sacs near the end of the tract termed ceca. This project will focus on determining the number and species of bacteria in the crop of poultry using molecular techniques based on nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA. We will determine how differences in feeding strategies and diet composition affect the composition, number and fermentation activity of bacteria in the crop. Most commercial animal diets are supplemented with a number of relatively expensive ingredients such as amino acids in order to meet their nutrient requirements. Since bacteria of the crop have opportunity to utilize the nutrients by fermentation before the host can absorb them for their own use, we will determine the extent to which this occurs and impact of changing feeding strategies.","Microbial ecology and nutrient fermentation in the upper gastrointestinal tract of poultry","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal nutrition and husbandry"
"The gastrointestinal tract of animals is sterile at birth but is colonised almost immediately by bacteria present in the birth canal and in the surrounding environment. Initially only a small number of different bacterial species colonise the intestine, however, as the animal ages more than 400 different species are thought grow in this enviroment. A number of factors can affect the type of bacteria that colonise the intestine of neonatal animals in early life. Major factors include the bacterial species associated with the mother, bacteria in the environment (e.g. premature infant in an incubator versus full term baby), the type of diet (breast-fed versus formula) and use of antibiotics. There is evidence that the pattern of bacterial species colonising the neonatal intestine can have long term effects ""programming"" colonisation patterns and intestinal health later in life. For example, the increases in allergy, asthma and eczema in children in developed countries may be associated with their relatively ""clean"" pathogen-free environment compared with children in developing countries. In this project we will use neonatal piglets to investigate this concept of ""microbial programming"". The piglet is an excellent model for human infants and the results will also have implications for how we manage baby pigs to improve health. First we will analyse the bacterial DNA in intestinal contents to precisely determine the pattern of bacteria colonizing suckling pigs from birth to weaning. Next we will obtain germ-free piglets, expose them for 5 days to selected bacterial species identified in the suckling pig and then raise them normally. We will then determine whether the bacteria the pigs were exposed to in early life affects their intestinal bacterial populations and/or intestinal health at weaning. If a microbial programming effect is demonstrated it may be possible to develop strategies to modify the intestinal colonisation pattern in early life to promote a healthier intestine later.

"My research focuses on interactions between insects within and between trophic levels in different ecosystems. My long term goal is to understand the similarities and differences of these food web interactions when the components of the food web changes. In particular, I am interested in how omnivores, which by definition feed at multiple levels within food webs, change their feeding decisions when presented with different types of resources and how the feeding decisions by omnivores impact other members of the food web. Omnivores must make decisions between feeding on basal resources that may be readily available, but of low quality, with searching for prey resources, which may be scarce, but of high quality. Thus, omnivores are faced with making foraging decisions where resources vary in quality, type and abundance. My central hypothesis is that omnivores will feed on other beneficial insects (high quality, high risk prey) depending on the type and quality of other food sources. I will test this hypothesis using two different omnivores that feed within two different food webs, one based on plants and one based on dead animals. These two food webs differ in that for insect omnivores that live on plants, plant resources are unlimited, whereas, for insect omnivores that live on dead animals, the animal resource is depleted over time. This allows comparisons of omnivory when both basal and prey resources vary in type, quality and abundance. It also allows me to achieve my short term goal of evaluating to what degree plant-based omnivores provide insight to mechanisms of omnivory on a broader scope. My research promises to make a strong contribution to our understanding of the role of resources at multiple trophic levels mediating omnivory. By studying insect food webs in different ecosystems, I explore the behavioural ecology of animals living in very different environments and thereby develop a broader understanding of community structure and food web dynamics.

"We use greenhouses as a model to study the structure of food webs and interactions of various guilds in response to changes in temperature and food web complexity into our model ecosystem. Commercial greenhouses represent newly created ecosystems every year as plants are introduced. Because they are contained ecosystems, we can manipulate both the abiotic and biotic components to determine the stability of the system. Specifically, we propose to build ecosystems of varying trophic complexity within a greenhouse environment, then challenge the ecosystem with climatic changes (temperature), changes in upper trophic guilds (introduction of predators, parasites, omnivores), and changes in primary producer guilds (introduction of plant community complexity) in order to measure the role of these factors on ecosystem stability and response to perturbation. We propose to use a combination of small scale laboratory experiments with large scale greenhouse experiments in order to measure the effect of perturbation at multiple scales. All experiments will be conducted at three scales: small leaf arenas for direct behavioural observations; small 0.5m2 cages for short-term population-level studies and greenhouse compartment studies for long-term food-web stability studies. Interactions within and between trophic levels will be measured using direct behavioural observations, leaf counts of insects for population monitoring, prey preference and mortality rate experiments as well as stable isotope ratios for determination of predator and omnivore diets.","Ecosystem response to perturbation at multiple spatial scales",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Evolution and ecology"

"Modern society depends on magnetic materials to an extent unimaginable even 20 years ago.  Their usefulness ranges from the trivial refrigerator magnet to the ubiquitous computer. The next paradigm shift is sure to occur at the nanoscale, with indications provided by the ever increasing information density of magnetic media. Research in magnetism is a particular strength of the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Manitoba, encompassing expertise in all facets of magnetic materials.  The research programs of the investigators will open the doors to the next generation of devices and applications based on controlled magnetism, especially at the nanoscale (nanomagnetism). Coupled with the development of nanomagnetism is the promise of an entire technology based on electron spin rather than charge, as is the case in traditional technology. This emerging field of ""spintronics"" lies at the very heart of nanomagnetism.



Experimental research into magnetism centers around studying the temperature and magnetic field response of systems. This requires low temperatures accessible only via liquid helium, and liquid helium to operate the superconducting solenoids that provide the necessary applied field strengths.  Using the requested equipment, we will be able to repair the helium liquefier in the Department of Physics & Astronomy, and ensure the future productivity and success of the research groups and their programs.

"Nanomagnetism in nanoparticles, thin films, and quantum spin systems:  Metals-based crystallites with sub-100 nm sizes, called nanoparticles, exhibit a wide range of physical properties that are strikingly different from their bulk counterparts.   Many novel properties arise from the large fraction of atoms that reside on the surface and the finite number of atoms in each nanoparticle core.  Our research program is dedicated to answering the fundamental question:  what overall effect does the surface have on the nanoparticle magnetism.  The magnetic frustration effects from the surface and core magnetism dichotomy in a nanoparticle can be ""peeled"" away onto a 2D surface.  A thin film that is a ferromagnetic layer interfaced to an antiferromagnetic layer is an ideal example.  Just like a nanoparticle, such a film exhibits the exchange bias effect.  Exchange bias is the result of magnetic moments at the interface which are ""locked-in"".  The physical origins of this ""locking"" are currently unknown. With a unique combination of nanoscale structural characterization, and a comprehensive description of the nanomagnetism from atomic to the bulk length scales, we intend to enable new insights into the physics of the ""locking"".   A further reduction in the degrees of freedom is possible in certain structures where interactions are possible in only one crystallographic direction.  A 1D quantum spin system is then created, an example of which are Haldane gap materials.  These materials exhibit novel magnetism. Quantum spin systems present a unique theoretical description whose robustness still requires rigorous experimental tests.  Our research group's significant experience measuring and modeling static and dynamic magnetism will provide unique insights into the physics of these materials.  There is an unmistakable, pressing need for knowledge in the above research areas.  First, the next generation of magnetic media hinges on shrinking device sizes where successful implementation depends on understanding the nanomagnetism.  Second, new medical technologies based on nanoparticle drug delivery require a comprehensive understanding of the magnetism of single and collections of nanoparticles.","Magnetism in reduced dimensions: Nanoparticles, thin films and quantum spin systems","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Magnetic properties and magnetic materials"

"Nervous system function relies upon patterned development of neurons and controlled establishment of synaptic connections. Axons of developing neurons are guided by instructive cues to their appropriate target areas, where they then select their correct synaptic partners. The molecular and cellular mechanisms by which this occurs are incompletely understood. In this Discovery Grant we will use genetic studies in the fruit fly Drosophila to understand how axons are guided by these cues and how they distinguish appropriate targets from inappropriate ones. This is a central issue in developmental neurobiology, and one for which Drosophila is ideally suited as a model system. Despite past successes, forward genetic screening in Drosophila can be limited by technical challenges and by genetic redundancies that obscure the detection of mutant phenotypes. Such limitations have undoubtedly left many genes and molecular pathways remaining to be described. In an alternative and innovative approach, we have used a gene misexpression system to identify genes and molecular pathways that can influence axon guidance. We recently reported the results of a screen in which we identified 42 candidates capable of influencing axon guidance, causing a range of effects from misprojections of axon subsets to severe nervous system disorganization. In this Discovery Grant, our overall hypothesis is that characterization of genes found in our screen will reveal new molecular pathways controlling axon guidance. We propose three main research Aims. First, we will unequivocally identify the genes responsible for observed misexpression phenotypes, and thereby discover molecules with the potential to act in axon guidance (Aim 1). Second, we will determine whether these genes are expressed in developing neurons and we will use loss-of-function approaches in vivo to determine if these genes are required for axon guidance (Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate the mechanisms by which selected genes affect axon guidance (Aim 3). Our overall goal is to explain at a molecular level the principles upon which nervous systems are organized during development, and to provide a world-class training environment for graduate students in neuroscience.

"Peripheral nerve injury (trauma, neuropathic disorders) in humans is common and often debilitating. While peripheral nerves do regenerate better than that of central nervous system, recovery is often incomplete, misdirected or associated with incapacitating neuropathic pain. Despite extensive efforts aimed at defining the nature of an injury response, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms remain however, poorly defined. Thus, one of the main objectives of this proposal is to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying an injury response, and those that promote nerve regeneration in a rodent model of nerve injury. Central to all regenerative responses is the protein synthetic machinery, which is required not only to inform the nucleus that an injury has occurred but also to synthesize proteins that are essential for new growth and regeneration - a number of which are synthesized locally in the axonal compartment. Based on our preliminary results (where we showed that a bona vide rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus are absent in axons), we hypothesize that axons synthesize proteins through a mechanism that is distinct from that of somal protein synthesis.  We seek to determine whether all translational components needed for co-translational targeting of proteins into the ER are indeed: a) present in axons, b) how they are organized at the subcellular level, and c) how they direct local protein synthesis. Secondly, we will determine whether these elements of the proteins synthetic machinery increase in injured and regenerating axons and then determine their cellular origin. In view of our recent data, in which we demonstrated that glia cells can ""export"" polyribosomes to injured axons, we anticipate an unexpected new role for glia cells in directing protein synthesis in axons. Taken together, these results will shed new light on fundamental mechanisms by which axons respond to injury signals, and in the future may pave the way for novel treatment strategies to promote nerve repair after trauma.

Problems of specific interest include authentication mechanisms which are usable for everyday tasks and ordinary people (vs. security or computer experts) using the Internet, for example for online banking or access to personal web sites. Mechanisms for authentication must be easy to use, otherwise they are bypassed by everyday users for whom security is not the primary goal; they must also be secure. However such ""usable security"" mechanisms have remained elusive, and only in the past few years is this beginning to be a significant focus of academic research. Practical problems that usable security mechanisms directly address, with respect to authentication and identification, include identity theft (which can result in significant personal losses in terms of time and dollars, and large collective economic losses), and loss of privacy (e.g., others may gain access to personal details intended to be available only to selected personal acquaintances). As one specific example, widespread use of social networking sites, without proper access controls, has lead to loss of privacy with serious implications. Similarly, dangers exist for other remotely accessed information, such as databases containing medical histories of patients. Usable authentication or access control mechanisms to address this will be explored and designed, as one example. The overall goal is to narrow the gap between usability and security, so that rather than having a choice between the two, convenient mechanisms can be employed which provide both simultaneously.

"My proposal is to study various combinatorial configurations.  These are subsets of a fixed source set of size v, where the subsets obey certain conditions.  In particular, one of the conditions that will be studied is that the subsets are all the same size, k , and that every pair of elements from the source set occurs the same number of times, t.  These are called 2-designs. The basic question is how many essentially different (non-isomorphic) designs exist when v,k,t are fixed?  These 2-designs are important in statistical designs, cryptography and coding theory.  We will use symmetries and sub-configurations to construct many pretty and useful designs.  We will also study the relationship between codes and 2-designs.

          If we change the condition on the subsets to be that the sets are all of size k and that every p set of the source set must intersect some subset in t or more elements, then we have a lottery scheme.  That is, the subsets, if viewed as lottery ticket choices, are guaranteed to give the holder a ticket of at least t winning numbers.  There is huge interest in the public in Canada and in the world on what the minimum number is for fixed v,k,p,t.  We will be creating tables of these numbers, or at least bounds on these numbers, as finding the absolute minimum is a very difficult problem.  These tables will be appreciated both by researchers and people who play the lotteries.  If we change ""t or more elements"" to ""exactly t elements"" in the previous definition, then the configurations we are studying are called splitting sets.  The question here is how small can we make the system of sets and still do all the splitting necessary?  The techniques used to construct splitting sets are entirely different from the ones used to construct lotto designs.   Our results on splitting sets are useful in cryptography and theoretical computer science.

     Finally, we will study Latin Squares, another combinatorial configuration, closely related to Sudoku squares.  We will be studying the properties of Latin squares and how best to construct them for their applications in statistics, communications and computer algorithms.

"A quarter of the biomass in a forest ecosystem can be found belowground but the dynamic production of new roots can account for up to 75% of the carbon allocation in a forest stand in a given year.  Thus the turnover of roots is an important contribution to the global carbon cycle, yet relatively little is know how this occurs within the soil profile. This project will investigate the longevity and turnover of fine roots within three jack pine ecosystems located across a 600 km N-S to provide a temperature gradient. Fine root dynamics will be observed with a minirhizotron system which utilizes a small video camera that is placed into clear tubes inserted in the ground. By observing root images on a monthly basis we will be able to determine root production and mortality and estimate root longevity. More importantly, this proposed project will examine the role of different diameter root classes to carbon turnover at different depths in the soil profile in order to understand root functionality for these very small diameter classes.  To further understand root functionality, selected roots will be subjected to x-ray microprobe analysis to follow metal profiles on the root surfaces.

"Our society relies to a large extent on processes in which particles play a key role. Catalysts in the chemical industry, ground ore from which minerals are extracted, pollutant-carrying particles removal in wastewater treatment, etc. In some cases particles are the problem (system clogging for instance, or the fact that they carry pollutants) whereas in others they are the source of the benefits we can gain from the systems we build around them (granular reactors, sand filters, chemical reactors). One of the most important properties of particles is their size and size distribution as this will determine volume-surface area-weight and many properties that are directly related to these basic physical properties, such as flocculation, flotation, etc. As a result many methods exist to obtain a measure of the size distribution, but unfortunately hardly any can obtain the desired size distribution in situ and without sample preparation. 



The financial contribution requested from NSERC's Research Tools and Instruments grant program is intended to acquire a monitoring equipment that can be mounted on a wide range of systems and can measure in situ, i.e. in the particle-carrying liquid. Hence, no sampling effects can deteriorate the quality of the collected data and representative particle size distributions are obtained in the studied continuous processes.

"Preserving urban river ecosystems while providing access to riverbank parks is a goal shared by many Canadian municipalities for improving the quality of life of their citizens. Home to local fauna and flora, urban rivers and their riverbanks offer great recreational opportunities for city dwellers. It is easy to forget that they constitute a major part of the municipal drainage system, as they evacuate stormwater in one case, and are sites to implement stormwater ponds in the other. While vegetation on riverbanks plays an important role in decreasing velocities at which runoff reaches the river, the storm sewer network is the greatest accelerator, discharging stormwater more rapidly compared to natural runoff. This has a direct impact on river hydraulics through point discharges at relatively high velocities during rainstorms, which tend to disturb river ecosystems in the vicinity, as well as downstream, of the storm outlets. Furthermore, stormwater also carries potential contaminants from runoff on the urban landscape that can negatively impact the local ecosystems. The flow regime of urban rivers differs most from the regime in natural rivers in the lower range of the rainfall intensity spectrum. This is also the range that offers the best possibilities for restoring adequate water quality and controlling velocities before release into the receiving waters. With rainfall events in Eastern Quebec on average every three days in summertime, an integrated stormwater management system for preserving ecosystems along an urban river reach must aim at providing the proper range of eco-hydraulic characteristics (velocities and pollutant loads) to sustain the biodiversity in local habitats for frequent rainfall events. As urban pressure on streams goes stronger, there is less space for traditional solutions, costs increase, and optimization becomes a necessity.

Optimization of existing stormwater systems by adding real-time control (RTC) of the stormwater discharge is the solution pursued in this project. RTC provides, on top, a means to flexibly adapt the system (with a lifetime of 50-100 years) to the changes in rainfall intensity spectrum expected from climate change.

"Due to increasing demands on the treatment efficiency, most of the existing wastewater infrastructure faces needs for optimization, upgrading or retrofitting. Measuring and control concepts are a cost-saving and environmentally friendlier alternative to the extension of reactor volumes and are an excellent solution to adapt the plant to different loadings and to free already existing but unused capacities.



A drawback is that a controlled plant is often driven to the limits of its capacity and subsequently sensor or other equipment failures can cause severe effluent limit violations if unsuitable control concepts are used. Urgently needed fault-detection concepts do not exist or are inefficient in daily operation despite the fact that measurements are the input for control loops and the basis for cost-effective plant operation.



Due to the above there is a strong need for new tools and new strategies to increase the reliability and fault-tolerance of control systems in wastewater treatment. In the described research project the available knowledge and experience from different disciplines shall be collected and translated into engineering practice. The work will be split into six parts:

A) Definition of 'Best available technology' for the required sensors with respect to process control.

B) Fault detection: Selection of most robust algorithms for fault detection. 

C) Review of existing and development of innovative control strategies for nutrient removal.

D) Development of fault-tolerant and efficient control systems with fall-back strategies depending on data quality and process behaviour.

E) Assessment of all control strategies in the IWA Control Benchmark and with full-scale data.

F) Implementation of concepts at pilot or full-scale plant

"Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is rapidly becoming the method of choice for implementing public-key cryptography. In large part this is due to the fact that ECC is ideally suited to constrained environments especially those that require 8-bit processors. We are now seeing ECC deployed in diverse consumer electronics (CE) products. For example, ECC is included in a new CE standard called the Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP) that is being used to secure content moving over a digital port. Hence we are now seeing ECC implemented in televisions and DVD players. New and potentially large markets for the technology are in the areas of sensors and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). These areas are undoubtedly the most constrained environments and the most challenging to add high-level security in the form of digital signatures and key agreement. 



My research program continues the investigation of the efficient implementation of ECC in different environments. I will also continue to work on the design and analysis of discrete-log protocols for key agreement, signature schemes, implicit certification, and digital postal marks.

"The proposed research concerns complex behaviour which occurs in spatially extended systems. One important example of such a system is fluid turbulence. Although turbulence has been on the menu of physicists, mathematicians and engineers alike over the past century, many fundamental problems remain unsolved. One important reason for this tantalizing lack of understanding is the fact that the governing equations, due to Navier and Stokes, are used to simulate turbulence in numerical experiments, but not usually to analyse the results. This is commonly done by statistical means, which blur the intantaneous structure of the flow and discard important dynamical detail. Recently, however, increased computer power and a string of fresh theoretical ideas have enabled us to study solutions to the governing equations with the tools of dynamical systems theory. This kind of analysis gives us an unprecedented insight in the role of coherent structures, such as vortex tubes and sheets, in establishing the observed statistics of turbulence. We will address several open questions in isotropic and shear turbulence, using novel computational methods in conjunction with a detailed analysis of the elementary physical processes.

Another area in which dynamical systems theory can fill the gap between phenomenology and the underlying processes is neuroscience. In the second component of the proposed research program we will attempt to explain some well-known, yet ill-understood features of the human cortex. Among a host of proposed models of human brain function, we will focus on a mean-field model of cortical dynamics. The output of this model is directly related to the signal measured with the electroencephalogram. This offers the exiting prospect of direct comparison of model analyis with experiment. In doing this we will attempt to find out which dynamical regime of the underlying mean field model can give rise to the observed spectral properties of the measured EEG, in particular to the well-known alpha and beta rythms.

"In order to be able to test, in commercially realistic light-emitting diodes, nanoparticles that have shown blue electroluminescence in prototype devices need to be adapted. Currently, we have two classes of hybrid nanoparticles that start from a 50 nm silica bead, on which InN or Eu2+ doped GaN have been grown. This makes these nanoparticles incompatible with the 100 nm thick polymer layer in commercial devices. In addition, solvents from which these polymers can be spincoated are typically toluene and xylene, in which our nanoparticles are currently not compaticle.

    )	Both aspect can be addressed as follows. The starting silica beads should be 10 to 15 nm, which can easily be made. The growth of InN or Eu2+ doped GaN will then be done accordingly. The InN or Eu2+ doped GaN do not form a closed thin layer around the silica bead but are present as small dots, which allows the surface modification of the uncovered silica. With standard silane chemistry, long alkyl chains will be attached covalently in order to render the nanomaterials dispersible in toluene and xylene.

    )	The third aspect that will be addressed is the tuning of the colour, by systematic variation of the synthesis parameters. The focus will be on the nitrogen-to-oxygen ration, because the blue emission of Eu2+ is sensitive to the number of oxygen and nitrogen ligands in its first coordination shell. In other words, the blue emission can be tuned by changing the crystal field. Similarly, the InN@SiO2 emission can betuned by careful control of the synthesis conditions.

"My research program will lead to new and better Ln3+ doped nanoparticles. Potential applications are in optical amplifiers for telecommunication, light-emitting diodes, and health-related research (nanomedicine). Materials that are up to the task to realize these applications do not exist, but can be synthesized.

The proposed research of synthesis, (optical) characterisation, and applications will form an ideal environment to train Highly Qualified Personnel in a multidisciplinary way. In addition, it provides ample training in collaborative research, which happens in all my projects. The lanthanides comprise the elements 57 to 71 in the periodic table of the elements and the ions have some very characteristic and unique (optical) properties. They can generate light from the ultraviolet and visible to the near-infrared when optically or electrically excited. Their emission in the visible is used in general lighting, displays, light-emitting diodes, and biolabeling. In biolabeling we also exploit the emissions in the near-infrared, because this radiation can penetrate tissue more deeply than ultraviolet and visible, thus making non-invasive diagnostics possible. The near-infrared emissions include the important telecommunication window between 1300- and 1600 nm. 

Another property of these lanthanides is that they enhance the contrast in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and we have recently published a new class of nanoparticles that are more potent that commercial contrast agents. We are, however, still, far from clinical studies, but collaborations to push this forward have been established. This class of nanoparticles allows the combination with other imaging techniques [tandem imaging], such as CT and PET, computed tomography and positron emission tomography, respectively.

"Dark matter constitutes 70% of the mass present in the Universe, this fact has been confirmed independently by many observations over the past 10 years. The nature of dark matter is still unknown, and one of the keys to this problem lies in the way dark matter is distributed in the Universe, and how galaxies form within dark matter haloes. This project is to investigate the distribution of Dark Matter using a technique called weak gravitational lensing. It uses the measured distorted shape of distant galaxies caused by space time warps and curves due to the presence of matter along the line-of-sight. The distortion is a direct estimator of the amount of dark matter projected along the line-of-sight. My research team will work on the Next Generation Virgo Survey, which is a recently approved Large Program at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope. The observations will take 771 hours on the telescope observing time over the next three years. The proposed research will lead to, but is not limited to, the discovery of very distant new clusters of galaxies, a detailed analysis of the dark matter haloes shapes and distribution as function of distance from us, a much better understanding of the galaxy formation process in their host dark matter halo using the nearby galaxies from the Virgo cluster.

This research will be very computing time and data storage intensive. This grant proposal is to request the computing equipment necessary for the success of the research.

"Cosmology is the branch of astrophysics which studies the large scale structures of the Universe. It is 

concerned with fundamental questions about its formation, evolution and its fate. Since the discovery made by 

Edwin Hubble eighty years ago that the Universe is expanding, our picture of it has considerably deepened. 

Astronomers have now a fairly accurate idea of the physical content of the Universe, how it reached its current 

state, and what will its future be. However, despite the increasing number of accurate observations, and the 

richness of details the Big-Bang theory can now discussed among specialists, our knowledge of the Universe 

poses a great challenge to modern physics: more than 90 percents of matter in the Universe is not visible, it is 

currently attributed to a new type of matter, which physical nature remains totally unknown, and the expansion 

of the Universe seems to be driven by a""fluid"" whose nature is also unknown. Are we on the verge of a new  

""Copernician"" revolution? These so called ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy"" components have shaped the 

Universe we see today. My research focuses on the observation and the interpretation of the dark matter and 

dark energy distribution using a novel technique based on the gravitational lensing effect. As A. Einstein 

predicted eighty years ago, the light passing nearby a massive body is deflected in proportion of the mass of the

deflector. Gravitational lensing can be used to measure the mass responsible for the light deflection. I am using 

this effect to trace, map and quantify the dark matter distribution in the Universe, which is the only way to see 

it ""directly"". The impact of this research will lead to the understanding the dark side of structure formation, i.e. 

from real direct observation of dark matter instead of indirect/speculations about it. Both physicists and 

astrophysicists have an interest in this topic: one of their challenges is to understand the nature of this new type 

of matter.","Exploration of the dark universe with weak gravitational lensing","Not available",CANADA,CANADA,"Extra galactic and cosmology"
"Molecular ions and radicals are highly reactive intermediates at normal temperatures and pressures. Despite their short lifetimes, these entities are of great importance as they drive numerous chemical processes such as combustion of fuels, polymerization to produce plastics, formation of astronomical objects and oxidative stress in wound healing. 



Although molecular ions and radicals are fundamental to many chemical reactions, little is known about their structures and dynamics because it is difficult to produce and trap them in the laboratory on time scales suitable for detailed experimental study. This research program combines high resolution spectroscopic techniques with ion sources and mass spectrometry to obtain rotational and vibrational spectra for a range of molecular ions and radicals. The experiments will be conducted at the University of Manitoba and the Canadian Light Source and involve a supersonic jet expansion to cool and isolate the unstable molecules. This serves to prolong their lifetime in the experiment and simplify their spectral signature. The spectra will be analyzed to obtain extremely accurate molecular structures and information about internal motions. These details are necessary to predict the chemical reactivity of molecular ions and radicals in other environments. 



A large portion of this program involves the exploration of novel experimental schemes. Although mass spectrometry has proven useful for studying ions and radicals in the laser spectroscopy community, its application at the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum remains virtually unexplored.

"My current research focuses on investigating ultra-cold, trapped gases of bosons (particles with integer spin) and fermions (particles with half-odd integer spin) when they are confined to effectively two-dimensions (2D).  This can be accomplished by making the confinement in one direction very strong so that the system has only two degrees of freedom. At these nano-Kelvin temperatures, the laws of quantum mechanics must be applied in order to describe the system.

These so-called 2D trapped quantum gases turn out to behave in ways very different from their uniform 2D counterparts.  For example, while a uniform 2D gas of non-interacting bosons cannot condense to a Bose-Einstein Condensate (i.e., where all particles are in the same quantum ground state) at finite temperature, a trapped 2D gas can undergo a transition to the BEC state. 

In experiments, the particles are in fact interacting, which introduces further complexity into the problem, so that one is dealing with a fully quantum mechanical many-body problem.  A full solution to this problem is challenging.  Indeed, depending on the Fermi or Bose nature of the particles, very different physics will be manifested.  My research objective is to understand the physics of these 2D trapped quantum systems using both traditional pen and paper and computational techniques.



I am also moving into a new field of research which involves a theoretical understanding of new organic compounds and semiconducting polymers.    These materials are attracting attention because they should provide low-cost and highly flexible alternatives to standard micro- and opto-electronic devices, such as diodes, transistors, LEDs, lasers and sensors, which are traditionally based on inorganic semiconductor technology.  Our current focus is a theoretical understanding of charge transport in pentacene-based organic thin-film transistors, particularly the ways in which the device performance can be optimized.

which is to develop a new set of geometric tools for addressing questions in

"With the emergence and massive adoption of new powerful and proficient technologies based on computer networks, new security threats are surfacing, and they need to be properly addressed. This research program pursues the design of robust network security systems that cope with current and future threats, such as malicious software attacks and network congestion due to abusive use of network services. Emphasis is focused on combating cleverly crafted attacks such as polymorphic or encrypted (concealed) malicious code, mitigating disruptive traffic, and detecting secret communication channels. A main component of this research program consists of designing effective covert channels for authentication of mobile devices (e.g., laptops, smart phones) in wireless environments. A foremost component of this program consists of synthesizing network activity to effectively convey relevant information to humans by the means of multimodal channels, including meaningful sounds coupled with efficient intrusion detection and mitigation systems.



Intensive training of graduate students takes place in state-of-the-art laboratories under rigorous areas of research. The outcomes of this program directly impact the well-being of the Canadian network infrastructures, leveraging the paramount importance of providing secure network environments for a plethora of applications used in almost all contexts of our modern society, such as Internet voting systems, rescue operations, health care applications, Internet telephony, and Web transactions in general.

"Sulfotransferases (STs) catalyze the transfer of a sulfuryl group (SO3) from the universal donor 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to a hydroxyl group of various substrates in a process called the sulfonation reaction. These enzymes share highly conserved amino acid sequence regions across all kingdoms; however, their substrates and physiological function are very diverse. In mammals, the sulfonation reaction is involved in mechanisms of cellular detoxification and in the modulation of the biological activity of steroid hormones and neurotransmitters. In plants, few STs have been characterized despite the large number of sequences found in databases. Understanding of their role in plant biology is still relatively speculative. Since the cloning of the first plant ST cDNA more than ten years ago from Flaveria chloraefolia, functional genomic approaches, particularly in Arabidopsis thaliana, have led to the characterization of brassinosteroid, hydroxyjasmonate, desulfoglucosinolate and flavonoid STs. However, these efforts are hindered by a limited knowledge of plant sulfated metabolites. The long term objective of our research program is to elucidate the biological function of the 17 sulfotransferase-coding genes present in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. The specific objectives of the present proposal are to identify the structure of the sulfated metabolites of Arabidospsis thaliana, to characterize the biological function of five of the 10-STs that remain to be characterized and to elucidate the role of the sulfonation of 12-hydroxyjasmonate in the control of flowering time and anther development using Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tobacum as experimental systems.

"Energy systems of the future must be cleaner and much more efficient, flexible, and reliable to meet the growing global demand for energy.  The Hydrogen Economy offers a potential solution to satisfying the global energy requirements while reducing (and eventually eliminating) carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy security. It also eliminates the reliance of humanity on the fossil fuels.

Before the Hydrogen Economy could be fully implemented three major obstacles should be overcome: (i) inexpensive production of pure hydrogen gas, (ii) technological improvement of fuel cells that would use hydrogen to run automobiles and (iii) hydrogen storage and in particular, on-board storage in an automobile. The latter requires high volumetric and gravimetric density of hydrogen, low operating desorption temperature, fast sorption/desorption kinetics, reversibility and low price. Storage of hydrogen in solid hydrides which absorb hydrogen like sponge water could meet all the requirements. However, before they become viable hydrogen storage materials, their hydrogen storage properties must be improved to meet the requirements. Addition of catalysts combined with the refinement of internal (grains) and external (particle) dimensions to the order of 10E-9 m, many times smaller than the diameter of a human hair, can substantially improve hydrogen storage properties of solid hydrides. In this study novel nanostructured hydrides will be synthesized and investigated with the aim to improve their hydrogen storage properties. Nanocomposites of various selected hydrides will be specifically investigated.

"My research program on the value-added processing of Canadian grains specifically focuses on grain carbohydrates such as starch and beta-glucan. I am interested in characterizing starch purified from various sources/genotypes in terms of their composition, structure and properties. In addition, currently my research is involved in how the chemical composition and structure of starch relates to its modification by chemicals and enzymes. The proposed research attempts to better understand the intricate nature of starch composition and structural inter-relationships that exist between starch components and how they influence the rate and extent of enzymatic digestibility.  Highly processed foods contain many types of starch derivatives that often result from complete digestion of starch to  dextrins/sugars, or by chemical modification to confer specific functional properties.  On the other hand, rapidly growing trends in processed food have shifted toward starches that are resistant to digestion to assist in controlling sugar metabolism in diabetics. Recently, there has been increasing interest in starch-based renewable bio-fuel alternatives like ethanol, which require starch from agricultural crops to be hydrolyzed completely to glucose, which is then converted into ethanol by fermentation.  This process is still unnecessarily expensive due to our lack of understanding and inability to control how the enzymes hydrolyze starch polymers of diverse structures. Regardless of whether starches are tailored to be resistant to digestion, as in the case with health foods, or to be readily digested, as required for ethanol production, the same research questions arise.  This proposed research will study the major agricultural starch sources in parallel and within a controlled set of experiments. This sort of comprehensive study has not previously been performed.  Using standardized procedures, the relationships between starch compositional, morphological and structural properties and the corresponding enzymatic digestibility will be systematically identified.  In particular, determining the structural basis for the degree of susceptibility of starch to enzymatic hydrolysis is necessary to control the product outcome and to provide a defined target for genetic research.

"The proposal is in the area of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic studying the descriptions of mathematical structures in a suitable formal (first order) language. During the last two decades there have been some major advances in the development of ""geometric"" model theory, with applications in number theory, algebraic geometry and other branches of mathematics. The main objects of study in this field are structures having a certain invariant independence relation and an associated notion of dimension, e.g. vector spaces or algebraically closed fields.  The subject has been constantly evolving by extending its scope to wider classes of structures (stable, simple, o-minimal etc). I plan to continue my previous research on  expansions of first order structures, both in simple and non-simple  settings. Expansion is the result of adding new relations to the language. Besides being one of the major sources of new examples in model theory, expansions can also serve as an effective tool for the study of model theoretic properties of the underlying structures. While the greater expressive power of the expanded language allows it to capture the features of a structure that were not definable in the original language,  one may lose certain ""nice"" model theoretic properties (e.g. stability or simplicity) when passing to the expansion. Thus one of the major questions is the existence of  expansions that are still analyzable from the model theoretic point of view.  Once such an expansion is found, one tries to characterize various properties of the original structure in terms of the expansion. Often this helps to discover new model theoretic conditions, or to generalize certain notions to a wider class of structures. I plan to focus on two specific kinds of expansions: expansions with a distinguished elementary substructure (elementary pairs) and expansions with ""externally definable"" subsets. The goal is to further investigate pairs of simple structures and their applications, to use pairs to clarify and refine the hierarchy of definability conditions within the class of simple structures, to extend the pairs technique to non-simple settings , and to explore ""generic"" expansions with externally definable sets.

"Human-machine interaction is becoming more and more prevalent in our lives. Eventually, we predict that such interaction will be linguistically communicative and will entail machine emulation of a human conversant. Simple interfaces such as voice recognition over the telephone will be replaced by interaction with physical agents operating in multiple signal/sensory modalities. An obvious question is how well will humans and machines be able to communicate if their respective domains of behavior are matched to a fair degree. In order to do this, we need to know what the bases of multisensory communication are for humans, so that we can insure that machines can operate within the necessary tolerances of human processing. This research uses  artificial devices such as a robot jaw, animated talking head, and a talking glove, along with distortions of human behavior to explore the range of distortions the communicative process can withstand at the levels of the production and processing of signals in auditory and visual modalities. Structural (face shape), functional (replacing the face with a hand), and behavioral (loudness) exaggerations in spoken behavior are used to characterize how the audible and visible components correspond and co-depend on one another. We call this correspondence and co-dependency between signals and structures ""coherence"". The goal is to determine how much distortion the human processing system can withstand before communicative interaction breaks down. Examining the effects of these distortions on both the production and perception of spoken communication will reveal what works in human-machine interaction and bring us closer to an understanding of how it works.","Concurrency, synchrony, and interaction in multimodal communication","Modelling and mathematical simulation of natural processes",CANADA,CANADA,"Systems, man and cybernetics"

"Fluid mechanics with emphasis on vortex flows is of our research interest. The generation of new knowledge and its industrial applications is of interest. Our algebraic n-family of vortices is now becoming the standard approach in modeling and analysis of vortex dominated flows. Due to its unique properties the model is expected to gradually replace the classical formulations. We are content with our research output during the duration of the last NSERC funded research and we are looking forward to an adequate future funding. In the application side, exploratory numerical tests suggest a substantial heat transfer enhancement in disk-like devices. Upon code validation we will proceed with the analysis of the processes involved with the device. Next a design strategy for compact heat exchangers will be proposed. The last will hopefully culminate into the filing of a patent. Based on our recent compressible vortex theory, the practical efficacy of the new optical measuring technique via the method of shadow will be gagged. The n-family of will be extended to include the combined effects of turbulence and compressibility. The already developed and tested aeroacoustic code will be engaged to examine the sound emitted by turbulent vortices as well as the infrasound signatures of vortices where Kelvine's waves are present.  In 1990 we reported three new interfacial instability phenomena. The fist involved a cylindrical solitary wave, the second an interfacial resonance, and the third the polygonal structures of vortex cores. Due to the importance of the phenomena in various scientific and technical disciplines the topic recently received worldwide publicity. The established experimental facility gives us the unique opportunity to examine several features of the first event in situ without having to pursue a soliton along a lengthy rectangular channel. The second and third events furnish a wide window of opportunity to investigate flow transition to turbulence through spectral development. The last three events are presently and will be for the coming five years under close experimental scrutiny through image processing and PIV measurements. Analytical approximations and numerical simulations will compliment the last research efforts.

"The current application proposes to study the Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half-integer weight by realizing them as theta constants arising from Mumford's theory of algebraic theta functions associated to polarized abelian varieties. In the case of interest, the abelian varieties are three-folds isogenous to the product of elliptic curves, and the polarization is deduced from a positive definite quadratic form in three variables.



Two specific projects are outlined below.



i) Study the arithmetic properties of the theta functions associated to abelian varieties as described above. These theta functions give a geometric realization of the automorphic theta correspondence associated to the ternary quadratic form implicit in the polarization, as studied by Waldspurger. Thus our construction of geometric theta functions gives an arithmetic incarnation of Waldspurger's correspondence, which in turn gives a mechanism for studying the values modulo p of quadratic twists of L-functions.



ii) The Fourier coefficients of the theta functions constructed above have a simple expression in terms of toric integrals associated to CM points. These are the same toric integrals occuring in the work of Gross and Zhang on the special values of Rankin-Selberg L-functions, and the time now seems ripe to reconsider the whole subject of toric integrals as developed originally by Waldspurger and subsequently re-examined by Gross and Zhang. In view of the important and varied applications of toric integrals, and the extreme obscurity of the literature on the subject, I propose to write a monograph on the subject in which I reconsider the subject from the beginning and develop the general theory from scratch in view of the present applications.

"The research described in this proposal is in the area of organic synthesis.  This type of research fits broadly under the heading of ""advancement of knowledge"" (basic research).  However, the project is not just a random attempt to synthesize anything new; the target molecules are specifically designed to have potential as pharmaceutical agents, more specifically with antitumour activity. Hence the proposal also fits into the broad area of ""medicinal chemistry"". The immediate aims of this project are to explore all aspects of the chemistry, and potential medicinal application, of new molecules in the triazene family (viz. R-N=N-NR2).  Interest in triazenes stems in large part from the pharmaceutical use of two triazene drugs for the treatment of cancer in humans. DACARBAZINE has been used for many years in the treatment of human malignant melanoma and, more recently, TEMODAL has been used for treating brain tumours.  Thus, there is a significant precedent for association of biological activity with the triazene family and there is every reason to be optimistic that new triazenes synthesized in this laboratory may have useful antitumour activity. A main thrust of the proposal is to explore the synthesis of novel bis-triazenes, i.e. compounds with two triazene units in the same molecule. The synthesis of the new triazenes requires investigation of the coupling reaction of a diazonium salt with innovative heterocyclic amines, such as piperazine, imidazolidine and the diazepanes.  The compounds prepared in this way fit into the general description of  1,x-diazacycloalkane derivatives.  Using this approach we will investigate the synthesis of triazene derivatives of various heterocycles, e.g. piperazines, imidazolidines, hexahydropyrimidines, 1,3-diazepanes and 1,4-diazepanes.  An extension of this approach will be to couple a diazonium salt with a mixture of a diaminoalkane and formaldehyde to afford novel bicyclic bis-triazenes. Furthermore, a major effort will be implemented to seek out collaborations with researchers in the pharmaceutical area, who would undertake to test the full library of previously untested triazenes that exist in this laboratory for biological activity, and the implied pharmaceutical application that will follow.

"Electronic communication systems are intrinsic to society and business. Because most electronic communications rely on wireless access, the demand for service continues to grow exponentially. However, the radio frequency spectrum is a finite, globally shared resource. The current demand for spectrum means that radiowave interference between users is limiting wireless communications and degrading signal quality. Therefore, innovative technology solutions that improve shared wireless efficiency are critical to Canada's economic growth. Today the only technology that allows users to share the spectrum more efficiently is a ""smart"" antenna, or one that adapts its operation to the presence of other users. Currently, smart antennas are too expensive to be commercially feasible for all users. This international and interdisciplinary research team will develop new designs for affordable, smart antennas that automatically and adaptively build and maintain reliable and efficient channels in the shared spectrum. A novel solution will be tested where the proposed smart antenna will adapt by mechanically moving the antenna elements in space. Electronic ""artificial muscles"" will actuate the deformable antennas. This new, solid state actuation technology has the potential to actuate the antennas at low cost. Design requirements will be defined and feasible actuation systems developed in parallel with novel antenna configurations. Then, both technologies will be integrated into a deformable smart antenna system. The benefits to Canada will include highly trained, interdisciplinary research engineers, improved technology transfer between scientific disciplines, dramatic efficiency improvements for wireless users, new artificial muscle technology, novel actuator designs for Canadian industry, increased collaboration and technology transfer between Canadian hi-tech manufacturer/exporter and University research, new intellectual property, and a clear new direction for the commercial development of the new antenna systems.","Deformable smart antennas","Communications equipment",CANADA,CANADA,"Electrical and electronic engineering"

"A central problem in scientific computing is the solution of large systems of linear equations.  Linear equations arise as a subproblem in practically every branch of computational science and engineering, including solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, electromagnetics, astrophysics, chemistry, solid and high energy physics, as well as in all manner of optimization and statistical problems.  Problems as disparate as designing automobile or aircraft engines, scheduling work crews at a large company, or developing next-generation imaging devices all require solving linear equations.  Indeed, for many of these problems, solving linear equations is the most computationally intensive step. 



Since the 1970s, asymptotic considerations have increasingly favored iterative methods for solving very large linear systems.  The key to efficiency of iterative methods is the selection of a good preconditioner.  A preconditioner is defined as a matrix that approximates the system under consideration and yet is easy to solve.  



In our previous work with graduate students and colleagues, we have discovered several new families of preconditioner, the most recent and perhaps most exciting being based on underlying graph structure (i.e., information about how the variables underlying the scientific problem are interconnected).  I propose to develop novel methods for preconditioning for many applications in optimization and scientific modeling.  I also plan to apply these preconditioners to practical scientific problems.

GAs are stochastic search techniques based on the principles of natural selection, heredity and genetics. The reason for selecting GAs is the fact that the reliability of mining equipment changes over time due to its dependence upon several covariates/factors (e.g. the operating environment, quality of repair). These factors combine to create a complex impact on a piece of equipment's reliability function. This impact encapsulates and inherits to some degree the individual characteristics of the factors as they evolve over time.  The overall idea is to investigate whether novel reliability assessment models based on GAs can produce satisfactory solutions compared to classical reliability analysis. So far, an Exponential distributions based GAs model and a Lognormal distributions based model have been developed and tested using collected data in the form of times between failures from underground mines. These two probability distributions have been found to fit historical failure data. However, the data indicated that the criteria of convergence does not suffice and it is imperative to develop models based on other probability distr. for achieving higher predictability. This proposal will first focus on the development and testing of new models and their comparison with the existing GAs models. Our previous research, on the combination of mine production simulation studies with GAs based reliability assessment models for analyzing the impact of mobile equipment failures on the productivity of mines, resulted in the development of a prototype mine simulator.  The next phase in the development of this simulator will require the implementation of higher functionality to better represent real life mine case studies.

"Corrosion is one of the most severe operational problems in the carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption process using aqueous solutions of alkanolamines, especially when carbon steel is used for plant construction. To suppress such severe corrosion to an acceptable level, corrosion inhibitors are widely applied to this process. However, current corrosion inhibitors are heavy metals that are inherently toxic and potentially pose adverse impacts on human health and the environment. Due to the environmental regulations on the chemical use and disposal, handling of such toxic corrosion inhibitors and disposal of the process waste are restricted and costly. New corrosion inhibitors which are environmentally acceptable must now be discovered to provide alternatives to industry. The ultimate objectives of this proposed research are therefore to develop cost-effective green corrosion inhibitors and establish best practices or strategy for an effective application of the developed green corrosion inhibitors. The proposed research is divided into three main tasks: 1) theoretical screening and formulations of potential green corrosion inhibitors, 2) performance evaluation of the formulated inhibitors, and 3) development of a predictive and mechanistic corrosion model for the green inhibitor system. The developed green corrosion inhibitors together with the strategy for effective inhibitor application will be readily available in response to environmental regulations and industrial needs. These inhibitors are expected to replace current heavy metal inhibitors, thus reducing cost of waste disposal and health risk. This would present an opportunity for Canada to take a leadership role in the area of green chemical use. In addition, practitioners, especially process engineers, would be able to factor in the developed green corrosion inhibitors in their strategy for the design and operation of CO2 capture processes to reduce energy consumption and solution circulating rate or size of process equipment. This would lead to significant savings in both capital and operating costs for CO2 capture, which are otherwise limited by corrosion problems. This would make CO2 capture more economical and environmentally favorable.","Development of green corrosion inhibitors for absorption-based CO2 capture processes","Oil, gas and coal",CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical engineering"
"Under extreme loading conditions, such as impact or blast, the behaviour of structural elements differs significantly from that observed under static loading conditions. The addition of inertial forces developed from mass accelerations and the dynamic behavioural properties of the materials comprising the structure, such as steel and concrete, bear heavily on the overall structural response. Various applications motivate the need to further develop the understanding of structure behaviour under extreme loads: marine facilities impacted by ice, barrier walls subjected to collision or blast, and as a result of recent increased terror activity, buildings subjected to blast and impact load.  



Experimental investigations into the behaviour of structural elements under impact loads are being undertaken at the University of Toronto. To fully characterize the dynamic loading behaviour of test specimens under impact, multiple data must be acquired simultaneously: impact force, inertial forces, and support reactions. To accurately measure these forces, high-speed recordings of the accelerations of both the impact mass and the test specimen are required. Specialized data acquisition equipment will be acquired to enable this. The installation of five single-channel amplifiers and accompanying connection boards within an already existing data acquisition system will result in the ability to monitor data at an increased sampling rate of 19.2 kHz at five independent locations.

"Users, in particular those doing professional research on a certain subject, frequently have complex information needs. By a complex information need we mean a user's requirement to obtain information pertaining to a specific type of relationship between two or more entities, such as ""What are the causes of inflation?"", ""What can prevent osteoporosis?"", ""What effect does glucosamine have on arthritis?, ""What do people think about stem cell research?"". Some examples of users who might have complex information needs are business analysts, intelligence analysts, investigative journalists, medical doctors, police detectives, lawyers, and scientists. For instance, a business analyst might want to find information about the effects of credit card fraud on the Canadian banks. Currently available information retrieval technologies do not provide adequate support to users with such complex information needs: firstly, interfaces do not encourage or assist users in formulating complex queries, and secondly, search algorithms do not attempt to find instances of specific types of relationships between entities. 



In the proposed research we aim to develop methods to help users find information in response to complex information needs. This will be achieved by, first, developing methods that identify and rank information items (documents, passages, sentences) based on the evidence that they refer to the specific type of relationship between the entities mentioned in the query. Secondly, we will work on developing methods that will interactively help users to express complex information needs. The developed methods will be evaluated through test collections and by means of user studies.

"This application requests funding for a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with diode array detector to separate proteins, peptides, substrates and enzyme inhibitors for study of bacteriocins and other peptides. Bacteriocins are peptide antibiotics (typically 30-60 amino acid residues in a chain) produced by bacteria for killing other species of bacteria. They are non-toxic to humans, are many orders of magnitude more powerful than conventional antibiotics (e.g. penicillin) and are effective against organisms resistant to current therapy, for example, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). There is a great need for new antimicrobial agents such as bacteriocins. Over 50% of hospital-acquired infections are resistant to standard antibiotic therapy, and 74% of gastrointestinal infections stem from ingestion of contaminated food. The requested instrument allows isolation of minute quantities of new bacteriocins and the enzymes that produce them from complex mixtures, including cellular extracts. It also assists studies on mechanism of action of bacteriocins. Other peptides under investigation include neopetrosiamides A and B, which were isolated from a sponge near Papua New Guinea and reported by others. These peptides prevent amoebic invasion of cancer cells during metastasis. The proposed structures have been chemically synthesized by us, and as a result have been revised slightly. The new revised structures match the natural products. We propose to make new analogs with improved activity and better synthetic accessibility to allow large scale production and full pharmacological evaluation as agents to prevent spread of tumours.

"Computer vision, simply stated, is about teaching computers to see, that is to perceive which objects are present in a scene, where they are located, and where they are moving. The ability to atomatically process visual information leads to a virtually unlimited number of applications, ranging from the traditional ones such as industrial inspection, security and surveillance, robot navigation, to the newer ones such as video conferencing, virtual travel, and special effects for the movie industry. New applications are being developed each year.

An optimisation based approach to computer vision is particularly promising and has already proved quite successful in applicability across different vision domains. There has been a tremendous progress in recent years in such fundamental computer vision tasks as stereo correspondence, image segmentation, image restoration, multi-view reconstruction, in large part due to the development of effective optimisation techniques. It should be noted that the recent progress is due to the optimisation algorithms themselves, since most of the objective functions they are being applied to have been used in computer vision for a long time but without good means to optimise them, and, therefore, with mediocre performance. A large portion of my previous research has been devoted to developing efficient optimisation algorithms, designed specifically for computer vision problems. At the same time, I am very interested in applications of optimisation methods to specific computer vision tasks. I find that there is a synergy between the theoretical methods and practical applications. It is from trying to solve a practical application that one finds interesting new optimisation problems. In turn, solving a new optimisation problem leads to an improved  performance on a practical application. I propose two research efforts, one directed at the theoretical issues in optimisation based techniques, and the other direction is towards practical applications of optimisation techniques.  The research in these two directions is closely intertwined.

"This proposal outlines a preliminary investigation into production operations at Eston Manufacturing, Linamar. The activity will focus on their current machining challenges associated with machining of C70 forged crackable steel connecting rod material. The objective of this preliminary investigation is to use this material and its processing challenges to refine the machine tool selection and process optimization approach being developed at McMaster University in the MMRI. Machining involves complex surface interactions which often limit productivity and quality as well as drive processing costs. The focus of this preliminary investigation is to explore the benefits of applying process models to understand machining conditions and the results of simulation studies performed in the lab. These results will be applied to aid in the selection and development of tooling as well as the optimization of the processing parameters for specific material and tool combinations as outlined above. Initial studies will involve collecting worn tools and sample parts together with their operating conditions. This data will then be used to set up the heavy load and high temperature tribometer currently at McMaster so as to duplicate the manufacturing conditions and the wear patterns that come from Eston Manufacturing's operations. A preliminary study will be performed to test the ability of various off the shelf coatings to protect the surfaces, control friction and minimize wear. This simulation data will also be used to identify opportunities to enhance productivity at Eston Manufacturing by increasing cutting speeds and feeds as well as reduce costs by improving tool life. This research adds a new class of materials to the range currently being researched at the MMRI and will further enhance our ability to address new materials in the future.","High performance lean manufacturing - a preliminary investigation","Manufacturing processes and products",CANADA,CANADA,"Advanced manufacturing"
"Canadian manufacturing is under considerable pressure to maintain a competitive position in the global market place while adhering to tight environmental regulations. To remain competitive companies must have access to high performance manufacturing technologies that address productivity, quality and cost as well as ""green"" manufacturing concepts that reduce environmental impact.  The approach taken in this research is to focus on surface interactions, since it is the surface of the tool which often limits a process.



Typically liquid coolants and lubricants are used to reduce the thermal and mechanical load experienced by the tool.  However the cost of these liquids is significant and their overall environmental impact is large.  Recently there has been more attention on using coatings to meet the specific surface requirements of a process.



In many applications considerable improvements have been made through the use of advanced coatings.  One of the key drivers in the past was improving the hardness of a coating.  However hardness is only one of many important properties.  Others include: friction, adhesion, oxidation resistance, the ability to absorb energy of impact and its adaptability.  The most critical property of a coating is its ability to maintain its properties at high temperature and under the heavy loads typical of high performance ""green"" manufacturing.



Preliminary research has focused on a number of approaches to reduce friction and minimize adhesive interaction.  An example application of this approach was the dry high speed machining of hardened die steel.  This resulted in an increase in productivity by a factor of two and an increase in tool life by a factor of four.  A key element of this proposal is to develop a better understanding of the underlying design principles which can be applied to guide surface engineering for manufacturing applications.

"Myelin facilitates signal transmission along the processes of the nerve cells called axons. It covers over 99% of axonal length by insulating segments of myelin sheath, separated by small gaps known as nodes of Ranvier - the key elements involved in signal transmission in myelinated axons. The myelin sheath is a compact multilayer structure formed by the myelin-forming cell tightly wrapped around the axon. Most of what is known about the organization of myelin sheath is based on studies of histologically processed (dead and dehydrated) tissue, while its organization and functional properties in living conditions remain largely unexplored. The compact multilayer organization is an obvious disadvantage for survival and maintenance because it lacks cytoplasm, the main component of any living cell containing vital organelles and molecules involved in the cell metabolism and self-renewal. Once formed, the myelin sheath persists for lifetime. Its survival can be partially explained by our preliminary data suggesting that in living conditions myelin has a significantly wider cytoplasmic access than currently thought. The proposed study will analyze in detail the organization of living myelin sheath and its responses to various physiological signals (increased axonal activity, ions, neurotransmitters, metabolites, hormones). We also plan to study the live interactions of myelin sheath with axonal membrane. Our preliminary experiments revealed that the contact areas of myelin sheath with axonal membrane around the nodes of Ranvier may undergo activity-dependent changes resulting in transient disconnections of myelin, unmasking axonal areas with ion channels and transporters normally hidden under the myelin sheath. Our aim is to uncover the mechanisms of dynamic modulation of axonal function (""axonal plasticity"") through these transient disconnections. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms of regulation of axonal function by dynamic responses of the myelin sheath to changing physiological situations, which is also important for understanding of the mechanisms of initiation of demyelinating diseases and conditions such as multiple sclerosis or axonal dysfunction after spinal cord injury.","The living myelin sheath: functional organization and role in dynamic modulation of axonal function in CNS","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,Neurophysiology
"The current research program has three long-term objectives: i) to develop and experimentally verify models of possible loss of containment (LOC) failure mechanisms in partially filled, externally heated or otherwise mechanically damaged, pressure liquefied gas (PLG) vessels, ii) examine, measure, model and verify complex industrial heat exchange and fluid flow loss prevention situations, and iii) continue to develop and refine the transient line source technique for the simultaneous determination of the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of fluids. In i) results from examinations of large-scale LPG vessel jet fire exposure trials indicate that a process of two-phase dynamic re-pressurization and/or two-phase quenching heat transfer may be responsible for some of the more violent Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion (BLEVE) accidents that have been recorded. In this commencement comes from a partial 'leak before break' (LBB) LOC. It has been tentatively verified from trials that the  depressurization resulting from the crack causes an already nucleated and now superheated liquid to yield rapid bubble growth and level swell which may cause a re-pressurization sufficient to cause the crack to become 'critical' and fail completely, and/or the resulting two-phase discharge to 'quench' the crack tip in the hot vapour wall, resulting in large tensile stresses that combined with those of the re-pressurization and the other vessel loads result in a catastrophic 'unzipping' of the vessel. For ii) analyses have been made to correct the historical record for the Flixborough Disaster. Extension of the work to include LNG risks is now being undertaken. This work should be of value to the Chemical and Process Industries as well as regulators. In iii) The transient line-source hot-wire instrument, for measurements of the thermal conductivity and diffusivity of fluids over a wide range of temperature and pressure, has been  improved in operation and precision with the identification of several major, and recently, overlooked corrections-analysis - procedures to implement these have been implemented.

"The objective of this research program is to advance our knowledge of the mechanics of sand-bedded river channels and, in particular, to develop physically-based predictive tools for how sediments move between their source and ultimate sink in the ocean.  The program is designed to use the sand-bedded reach of the lower Fraser River as a natural laboratory to investigate and quantify processes.  The Fraser also will serve as a prototype for more detailed observations in SFU's new Landscape Dynamics Laboratory that will ultimately lead to a physically-based predictive model for the morphodynamics of sand-bedded river channels, and the Fraser River in particular.  At present, there is some understanding of how much sediment is moving into the sand-bedded reach of the Fraser River and how much is being deposited on the Fraser's delta and tidal flats, yet the mechanisms responsible for moving sediment through the 85 km river reach that passes through British Columbia's Lower Mainland is understood only conceptually.  The dynamics of sediment in the river control response to flood flows and the quality of habitat in the channel, delta, and tidal flat environments.  A physically-based model for sediment routing is required to make reliable predictions of how the sand-bedded channel and the delta environments will respond to various perturbations (i.e. a warmer climate, changes in water flux, changes in sediment flux associated with land use practices, and contemporary variation in sea level).  There is a pressing need to make predictions of sediment transport in sand-bedded rivers that empty into the sea, such as the lower Fraser River, because they are often sites of intense urban development world-wide and the dynamics of these natural landscape processes significantly affect the socio-economic viability of this development.","Sediment delivery to the Fraser River Delta; sediment transport mechanisms and modeling framework","Earth sciences",CANADA,CANADA,Geomorphology
"Computer chips have had a tremendous impact in all aspects of science and the every day life of the modern Canadian. They support a plethora of everyday activities and facilitate experiments not previously possible. A slowdown in performance improvements could easily have a ripple effect slowing down further innovations. Today, this demand requires an increasingly complex design environment, where new standards and processes emerge to facilitate the development of the one billion transistor-count systems. For this reason, the experience of the human designer is tightly coupled with the use of automated Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools. 



As the size of the design increases while the transistor shrinks, current CAD theories and practices find it hard to meet the new challenges and maintain performance. This work promises to generate groundbreaking new theories and implement novel CAD tools to alleviate the verification, debugging and test pain. These processes take more than 70% of the development cycle and can cost millions of dollars to domestic and international semiconductor companies. The project aims to experiment with contemporary formal Quantified Boolean Formula Satisfiability (QBF) engines to produce a unified framework for the verification, test and debug of nanometer scale circuits and systems. It will revise and advance fundamental results in CAD for Very Large Scale of Intergation chips, a rich and continuously evolving area that enables the rapid development of the semiconductor sector today. Because it experiments with QBF, the deliverables of this project will benefit other scientific fields too such as other areas of computing (security, artificial intelligence), biology and finance. Results from this research will be published in premiere conferences and journals, increasing the visibility and cross-disciplinary character of the project. It will also help us maintain our competitive research lead worldwide while investing in the education of highly qualified personnel with irreplaceable benefits to the Canadian economy and the Canadian society.

"The research which is presented in this proposal is aimed at the design and development of knowledge-based systems (KBS) for the analysis and diagnosis of medical images. Medical imaging is a fundamental aspect of numerous clinical decisions and its importance continues to increase in many areas of medicine. In recent years, the substantial developments in the field of computer technology have created remarkable progress in many areas including medical image processing. Among the different techniques used for medical imaging tasks, knowledge-based methods attempt to utilize the information that creates the appropriate models for image understanding and interpretation. The aim of this work is to provide a specific view as to how the information originating from the medical image context can be combined with a comprehensive knowledge-based technique to help solve the following problems:

1) Automatic detection of disease in its very early stages. This could be an ideal strategy for many diseases such as breast cancer, as early treatment is much more likely to be successful. Such a system can dramatically help a radiologist recognize the disease in the most treatable stages and reduce the chance of misdiagnosis. 

2) Automatic tracking of progressive diseases over a long period of time. It could also be an essential approach for many common conditions such as the development that leads to the occurrence of stroke. The proposed system offers physicians the opportunity to design a treatment plan using analysis that indicates how the disease has progressed in the past and predicts how it may develop in the future. 

This work shows promise due to its ability to fully incorporate all the available information. The main expected impact of this work is advancement in the field of knowledge-based computer-aided analysis systems for medical images. In addition, the results can greatly improve the accuracy of radiologists and reduce their efforts in diagnosis, thus increasing their availability for other tasks.

"Micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) are a family of miniaturized devices that are being designed and developed for a wide array of applications that range from information and communication technologies to medical diagnostics and therapeutics. These technologies have the potential to make a revolutionary impact on our society, economy, and quality-of-life. However, many formidable scientific and engineering challenges must be solved before this potential can be fully realized in practice. In this context, the overarching goal of my research program is to conduct fundamental materials research that has immediate and direct implications for the design of future generations of MEMS/NEMS with enhanced functionality, improved performance, and greater reliability. 

The program of research proposed here is motivated by the need to design micro- and nanomechanical resonators with very high quality factors (ranging from ten thousand to a million) for applications in communications, sensing, imaging, and vibration energy harvesting. The rational design of such resonators requires a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of energy dissipation and damping in thin film materials. To this end, arrays of micro- and nanomechanical resonators will be microfabricated, characterized, and tested over a full range of parameters. These systematic experiments will be combined with our unique expertise in computing background damping due to thermoelastic coupling to establish, for the first time, a full and accurate data set for the frequency dependence of damping of a wide set of materials of interest to MEMS/NEMS. This data set will be used to develop models for the mechanisms of internal friction, and to develop guidelines for the selection of materials and structures in the design of high-performance micro/nanomechanical resonators. The proposed program offers excellent opportunities for making innovative, scientifically-interesting and technologically-relevant contributions, and for training undergraduate and graduate students in important areas of science and engineering.

The proposed nanostructure analysis by Microscopy (NSOM/SNOM) is a microscopic technique for nanostructure investigation that breaks the far field resolution limit by exploiting the properties of evanescent waves.

         State-of-the-art nanofabrication techniques require heavy capital investment, have high operational costs, and involve long processing times. Maskless nanofabrication techniques have gained significant research interest in recent years and are characterized by fewer processing steps, pattern flexibility, and significantly reduced capital and operational cost.

        The proposed facility will allow researchers and engineers to develop their design ideas using new maskless nanofabrication concepts and methodologies. Similar facilities have been established by a few international institutions, but no comparable facility exists anywhere else in Canada.

"My research is primarily directed at observational tests of galaxy formation scenarios.  By determining the chemical signatures for various stellar populations from halo field stars, to globular clusters, to stars in a variety of dwarf galaxies, then we can reconstruct the chemical evolution of each system and compare that with predictions for the merger history of the Local Group from semi-analytic models and N-body simulations.    In this NSERC renewal, I outline two new MSc projects, two new PhD projects, and a project that requires PDF expertise, all within my research goals and collaborations.    The PDF project involves modeling of the chemical evolution of the Carina dwarf galaxy from the detailed chemical abundance ratios that I am currently calculating from high resolution spectra of its RGB stars; this position will bring new expertise to UVic while also complementing the existing resources.   The PhD projects include (1) the analysis of the metallicity, kinematics, and ages of the various stellar populations in the isolated dwarf irregular galaxies, particularly of the old stellar populations to compare with models of protogalactic fragments, and (2) the detailed analysis of stars in outer halo globular clusters to determine the homogeneity and origins of the outer Galactic halo.   This latter project would begin as an MSc project.  The other MSc project includes the detailed chemical analysis of stars in the new ultra faint dwarf galaxies which may harbour the most metal-poor stars in the Local Group.   An additional project on the effects of dust on the chemistry of metal-poor stars is outlined herein.   These projects are part of the new program in stellar chemistry at UVic, which compliments the existing strong programs in stellar evolution and galaxy formation, as well as a newly developing program in stellar nucleosynthesis.

"Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, can dramatically impact the socio-economic well-being of countries, and in a more serious context, our basic survivability. Recent earthquakes have shown the importance of a fast, dynamic and coordinated action plans to increase the chances of survivability for society. The extent of the damage and impact on society resulting from a catastrophe can be significantly minimized by the implementation of real time monitoring of critical assets. Bridges are not only a critical link of the transportation network in the province, but also serve as important infrastructure for the transmission of electricity, gas and communication components between communities. This is why it is important to provide key information not only on the physical integrity and state of aging of a bridge structure, but also on the electrical, gas, and communication components that use the bridge as way to convey these services between communities. This research proposal is for the development and testing a methodology for real time monitoring of critical infrastructure.  The focus of this project will be on a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system that will be part of an advanced network of sensors for bridges in urban areas of British Columbia. 

     The primary idea of a SHM system is to provide a means of evaluating the state of the structure remotely, without visual inspection. Such a system is essentially the integration of a sensory system, a data acquisition system, a data processing and archival system, a communication system, and a damage detection and modeling system to assess the integrity of structures on a continuous or periodical basis, or immediately after a significant event, such as an earthquake, a hurricane or a blast. The current state of the hardware technology for monitoring is well established; there are many companies that provide monitoring systems, and there are many examples of structures that are currently monitored. The purpose of this project is to develop and implement a decision support system that can provide information to experienced engineers as well as to facilities managers who may have limited engineering background.

"Widespread adoption of multi-core processors, along with continuing increases in number of CPU cores should

deliver more computing power to consumers and industry. In order to fully benefit from these systems,

however, programs must be adapted to exploit multiple processors, and this is a difficult and time-consuming

process. This project will develop efficient, scalable and automatic mechanisms to convert programs written

for a single processor to programs that can use multiple processors, greatly simplifying the task of writing

programs for multiple processors. This support will be implemented without changing existing programming

languages or introducing new and specialized hardware requirements.

This work is important to the computer software and hardware industries and their clients because the

anticipated outcomes are performance gains on existing multiprocessor computers and also increased software

development productivity. Scientific benefits include a deeper understanding of the underlying ability of

programs to use multiprocessors as well as the automatic techniques needed to exploit this ability. In addition

to direct benefits to the industry partner, Canada will benefit economically due to training of highly qualified

personnel in this field, and because portions of this work are freely available as open source software. It will

benefit socially because computers are a part of daily life, because of increased collaboration between industry

and academia, and because of increased visibility worldwide as a research leader in this field.","Speculative multithreading in a java just-in-time compiler","Computer software",CANADA,CANADA,"Software and development"
"This research is intended to investigate and develop compiler, runtime and language improvements for modern concurrent programming systems.  Many new programming language modifications have recently been proposed based on ""transactional programming"" as a paradigm.  These designs vary in the kind and in the exact semantics of the features provided, but all aim to improve programming practice with as little impact on performance as possible.  Our research will perform a practical investigation into the implementation aspects, developing appropriate optimizations and exploring which features can be implemented feasibly and which will be suitable for improving programming.  Further optimizations for concurrent programming that go beyond the specifics of transactional programming will also be covered, allowing our results to be useful for a wide variety of new and existing concurrent language designs.","Compiler, runtime and language techniques for the efficient use of multiprocessor systems","Computer software",CANADA,CANADA,"Distributed and parallel processing"

"    )	The genes that control eye specification in different animals and insects are highly conserved, yet they specify the formation of vastly different eye structure across these species.  In this proposal, we describe experiments to study the role of the Nemo protein in specifying eye and head fates in the fruit fly Drosophila.  In the development of the head and eye structures, there are certain genes that act to repress head fate, thus promoting eyes.  Other genes repress retinal eye fate and promote head cell identity.  Some play roles in both processes.  The proteins that carry out these diverse functions are regulated through multiple tiers of protein-protein interactions.  Our studies of Nemo have revealed that Nemo is required to suppress the function of certain head-promoting proteins, while being required for the activity of certain retinal proteins.  Thus Nemo seems to play an integral role in ensuring the proper balance between the opposing activities that occur during the development of the organism.  

    )	Nemo is a member of the evolutionarily conserved Nlk family of protein kinases.  Work from our lab in Drosophila and in other systems have already revealed that Nlk family members can control aspects of development and cellular growth by modifying certain proteins through phosphorylation.  In the present grant, we describe work that will wider our understanding of the targets that Nemo can regulate, as well as revealing new regulators of Nemo activity.

    )	Recent work has shown that the retinal genes under study in this grant actually have a wider scope of action, being involved in the proper patterning of various tissues in numerous organisms including man.  Thus the regulation of protein activity that occurs in the eye, and which we propose to more fully characterize, may be a more general phenomenon controlling differentiation of multiple tissues.

"In 2000, the World Health Organization estimated that over 177 millions people have diabetes, including more than 2 millions Canadians. The financial burden of diabetes and its complications on the Canadian healthcare system is enormous estimated at $13.2 billion every year. A major challenge in the treatment of Type I diabetes is the prevention of late complications, usually achieved by intensified insulin treatment.

   Tissue engineering of a vascularised bioartificial pancreas could become an important element in the treatment of diabetes. However, survival of cells deeply embedded in engineered tissue constructs is compromised by lack of capillary development causing necrosis. Because of this limitation, culture and growth of large tissue mass are poorly understood.

   Tissue engineering integrates the sciences of chemical and biotechnological engineering, biomaterials, cell biology, and transplantation to create tissue and organ substitutes. Several challenges face the development of an engineered tissue product: cell sourcing, immuno-compatibility, maintenance of sterility and uniformity during the growth process, ""scalability"" of the manufacturing process, etc. There is a need for a culture process to control cell and tissue growth.

   The general objective is to develop and use a co-culture process to guide the growth of a vascularized bioartificial pancreas within a defined 3-D environment. The main concept proposed here consists

to use bioactive scaffolds and a bioreactor system in which operating conditions can be modulated to guide pancreatic tissue and micro-vessel formation.

   The methods described in this proposal are well established in Vermette's laboratory and are supported by preliminary results. High-impact publications and intellectual property (IP) will be created. This project will make a major contribution to the training of highly qualified personnel in biotechnological engineering.

"The Human Genome Mapping Project has allowed the identification of genes and gene defects implicated in a number of inherited diseases. Gene therapy represents the repair of defective protein expression in these diseases where there are no adequate therapies available. The basic idea is to replace the ""sick"" gene with a ""healthy"" one or to add a new gene to promote the synthesis of a therapeutic protein.  The transfer of the gene (plasmid DNA) across the cell membrane to the target, transfection, has been mainly pursued using viral vectors with native DNA having been replaced by the required DNA. The procedures using such vectors are complex, hazardous, and expensive. Recently, nonviral vectors have been studied as alternate agents. We have found that surface active agents (soap-like) consisting of two positively charged head groups and two alkyl tails, connected by a hydrocarbon spacer group, can act as effective nonviral vectors. The complexes they form with DNA, in the presence of a ""helper-lipid,"" have been shown by us to be able to express a therapeutic protein within certain cell lines. The objective of the next stage of research is to improve the transfection efficiency of these nonviral vectors; (i) by modifying the chemical structure of the surfactant so that the morphology of the resulting complex with DNA is better adapted to transfer through the cell membrane and (ii) to improve our insight of the mechanism of release of the DNA from the endosome once it is within the cell. The development of topical delivery systems for therapeutic agents is a priority area, worldwide, for public and animal health agencies. However, at this time there appears to be little Canadian-based research focusing on this activity. The project described here will be an important step in keeping Canada at the forefront of this research area.

"Electrophoretic Ink (E-Ink) and Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) technologies, combined with thin-film, flexible circuit substrates are starting to deliver displays that are so thin and flexible, they are referred to as digital paper. These technologies will allow for displays that curve around the surface of any form, 3D or flexible. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) was invented for flat, single-display, single-coordinate input/output. It is too limited for this new generation of non-flat computers. Major advances on input technologies are required for such computers to sense multi-handed, multi-finger touch as well as shape transformation and haptics. The overall goal of this project is the development of new Organic User Interface (OUI) techniques for non-flat computers. We propose that these OUIs will feature shape-based multi-touch inputs that operate on wrap-around thin-film, flexible display surfaces that come in any 3D shape or form. These involve curved and flexible designs, as well as implementations of textile, plastic, cardboard, and paper-like computers. To achieve this goal, our first objective will be to develop input techniques for non-flat displays. We will then develop interaction techniques and applications for such computers. These techniques will then be implemented on rigid and flexible displays of arbitrary forms. Finally, interaction techniques, applications and concept products will be tested and validated empirically through user studies. Research will be conducted by researchers and graduate and undergraduate students at Queen's School of Computing in collaboration with top researchers at Autodesk Research Canada and the University of Tokyo, and industrial designer Yves Behar at fuseproject. The expected outcomes include a number of concept products of the future, e.g., a flexible green e-book reader. Commercialization of research results will be in coordinated through Queen's PARTEQ Innovations in cooperation with Autodesk. Economic benefits of the research include new sector development as well as the training of highly qualified personnel for that new sector. The outcome includes green display technologies that consume less energy than the technologies they replace.

"The overall goal of this project is the development of new Organic User Interface technologies (OUI) for computer displays of any shape or form. Electrophoretic Ink (E-Ink) and Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) technologies are starting to deliver displays that are so thin and flexible, they are referred to as digital paper. This will allow for displays that curve or flex around the surface of any material: textile, plastic, cardboard, or paper-like, and any form, creating an entirely new line of non-flat computing devices like digital paper and other products. Given this context, current generations of user interfaces, based on the Graphic User Interface (GUI), suffer from three problems that this proposal aims to address. Firstly, all input and output was designed to operate on a flat surface and is unsuitable for curved or flexible screens. Major advances on interaction techniques are required to allow users of curved or flexible systems to apply multi-handed, multi-finger gestures for shape deformation input. Secondly, no displays exist that are capable of delivering real and touchable 3D imagery. Thirdly, little is known about the psychology of interacting with non-flat display interfaces. These three problems are addressed through five projects: input algorithms, interaction techniques, hardware and applications, molecular displays and empirical studies. Our first project aims to develop input techniques for non-flat displays.  Our second project aims to develop interaction techniques for rigid and flexible displays of arbitrary forms. The third project aims to develop hardware and applications for non-flat computer technologies. Our fourth project aims to begin development of actuated surfaces capable of displaying 3D images using molecular robotics. Our final project is to validate the usability all of the above interaction techniques. We believe the application of the knowledge acquired through this international and interdisciplinary research effort will be critical to commoditization, effectiveness and sustainability of our key technology: the computer. A significant contribution of this research program will be the training of personnel in user interface design and evaluation, where there is high demand for highly-qualified professionals.

"The Canadian Institute for Health information (CIHI) estimates that Canada's healthcare spending in 2006 was $148 billion or approximately 10% of the nation's GDP. Perhaps more importantly, the total spending in healthcare has outpaced inflation and population growth for the 10th consecutive year according to CIHI. This calls for immediate and sustained efforts to increase the efficiency and quality of care delivery in addition to improving health outcomes. Accordingly,  ""health and related life sciences and technologies"" are identified as one of the four priority areas in Canada's science and technology strategy. 



Notwithstanding the remarkable advances in the field of medicine, the healthcare sector in Canada is lagging behind other service sectors (such as airlines, banking and retail) with regards to the adoption of the most recent information technologies and operations management techniques.  In the information technology arena, for example, the development of electronic health records across Canada has been the primary focus, whereas the effective use of this information repository in streamlining healthcare processes has received little attention. The experiences in the other service sectors suggest that there is significant potential to achieve efficiency and quality improvements in healthcare by incorporating state-of-the-art operations, information and communication technologies in the design and management of care delivery processes. In order to contribute to the required human and knowledge infrastructure, lead researchers from six Canadian Universities (i.e., UBC, Toronto, Queens, Ottawa, Montreal and McGill) join forces under the umbrella of this research training program.  The objective of this initiative is to increase Canada's research and knowledge transfer capacity in healthcare operations and information management by training doctoral students and post-doctoral fellows. The team's vision is that the trainees of this program are future agents of change for the healthcare system nationwide.

"The problems facing forest companies have become significantly more complex for several reasons: (1) management for environmental resources involves impacts on processes with varying time and spatial scales; (2) protection and enhancement of many environmental values require optimization of spatial configurations hence involving very large problems; (3) the management for multiple values involves more complex sets of constraints and objectives; and (4) lack of information (e.g. lack of precise data) and knowledge (e.g. uncertainty with respect to long term biological impacts) increase the importance of treating risk and uncertainty explicitly. In addition to facing complex choices of silvicultural strategies, many forest companies must cope with interference in their forest arrangement from ""overlapping"" tenure holders which have rights to exploit other resources on the same forest. The objective of our research program is to develop models that will assist both industry and government to find optimal management strategies that take explicit account of the institutional arrangements that regulate forest operations. We plan to develop more efficient algorithms to identify optimal spatial assignment of land use activities using new institutional designs (e.g. zoning). We also plan on refining these models to include the potential impacts of significant natural processes (fire, succession). An important issue facing many forest companies is the issue of overlapping tenures. Governments often provide the rights of using different resources on forest lands to different companies. For example, different companies are assigned rights to different resources (e.g. forestry and oil and gas). The exploitation of different resources on the same land by different companies can lead to conflict and significant waste if done without coordination. We plan to model the decisions facing forest companies under different overlapping tenure regimes and explore a variety of cooperative joint planning options. We will consider a variety of alternative distributional mechanisms (cost-sharing mechanisms) to identify a fair distribution of payoffs and costs among the tenure holders. The models will be tested through a sequence of case studies in Ontario, BC and Alberta.

"Human-induced climate change maybe the greatest environmental challenge ever faced by humankind.  Amongst the solutions to decrease greenhouse gas emissions is a greater reliance on biologically, environmentally, and economically effective biofuels.   Although much emphasis in North America has been put on bioethanol derived from corn and wheat, without addressing the greenhouse gas emissions derived from the inputs required to produce these crops, the greenhouse gas savings will be marginal. The production and use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer is the single largest source of greenhouse gas production in the production of these crops.  This is largely due to the fact that after its application in the field a proportion of N fertilizer is converted to nitrous oxide, a gas which is 300 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.

   Sugarcane is the most efficient bioethanol crop in tropical climes because of high biomass yield, its efficiency at accessing and using soil N, and because the crop can be infected with bacteria which provide N to the plant in a process known as biological N fixation (BNF).  BNF is the bacterial conversion of N from the atmosphere to ammonium, a form of N which can be used by plants. 

    )	In temperate climes, sugar beet is the most common sugar crop for the production of bioethanol and is much more efficient as a bioethanol feedstock than many other crops.  However, recommended rates of N fertilizer for sugar beet crops are commonly 100 kg N per ha.  The biological, environmental and economic efficiency of sugar beet could be greatly increased if a portion of its N requirement could be offset by BNF in the plants.  

   The long-term objective of my research program is to advance knowledge in beneficial plant-microbe interactions and to develop plant-microbe combinations which increase the efficiency and sustainability of cropping systems.  The objective of my research over the next 5 year period will be to identify and characterize symbioses between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and sugar-rich crops, particularly sugar beet, but also sweet pearl millet and sweet sorghum.

"The focus of this research is the design and analysis of algorithms. A major goal is the development of efficient algorithms with provably high quality for assorted problems in network design and optimisation. In particular, we are concerned with routing under restrictive internet protocols, and with the design of effective telecommunication and transportation networks. Moreover, I will also investigate the interactions between theoretical computer science and economics, such as the impact of competitive behaviour in computer science. 

Practical instances of this type include mechanism design, broadcast pricing, fixed investment decisions, routing in networks, and internet auctions. Another example concerns the application of techniques from theoretical computer science to economics. As an illustration, the importance of speed and efficiency in computing equilibria and in auction design is now well accepted. The breadth of application motivates the algorithmic approach used in theoretically analysing these interactions.

"A frontline of defense against threats to homeostasis (i.e. stress) is provided by the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which governs the mobilization of energy stores under challenging situations.  Sex differences in the activity of the HPA axis can be explained, in part, by the inhibitory actions of testosterone in males and by the stimulatory actions of estrogen in females.  However, manipulating androgen and estrogen exposure over the perinatal period in the rat causes profound and permanent (organizing) effects on HPA responsiveness to stress during adulthood.  Several studies continue to show an involvement of androgen and estrogen receptors in mediating the organizational effects of sex steroids on HPA outflow.  However, our research has shown that the principle regulator of the HPA axis, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, is devoid of sex steroid receptors within neurons that regulate HPA outflow directly.  Thus, how and where the organizing effects of sex steroids are executed in the brain has not been resolved.



Here we propose to test the requirements for and site(s) of involvement of neonatal sex steroids in programming stress-related pathways in the brain, including those mediating neuroendocrine and behavioral responses.  This will be achieved by assessing sex steroid hormone receptor distribution and function, as well as stress HPA and behavioral responses in adult animals that have been exposed to sex steroid hormone agonists/antagonists during critical neonatal periods.



This approach provides us with a unique opportunity for determining how naturally occurring variations in neonatal sex steroids program the adult brain.  Our findings will impact several disciplines, considering the power by which early sex steroids reign over the morphology of the brain, endocrine function, and behavior in general.

"Many lizards are able to voluntarily self-detach (autotomize) their tails as an antipredator strategy, and then regenerate a replacement.  This ability to replace such a large portion of the body is unique among amniotes (reptiles and mammals), and yet remains poorly understood.  In particular, a basic understanding of the events leading to the regeneration of tissues is lacking.  We hypothesize that regeneration is a repetition of embryonic development.  Our objectives are to investigate and compare original (embryonic) tail development with de novo regeneration.  We will examine the histology and cellular composition of the tail at key stages of development and regeneration in two species of commercially bred gekkotan lizards (geckos).  Geckos are a novel and less invasive model system for regenerative studies.  A single individual is able to repeatedly shed and regrow the tail, and many species are easy to maintain and breed in the lab.  A more detailed understanding of this naturally evolved ability provides an obvious complement to mammalian stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.  Furthermore, these data will provide important new insight into the biology of lizards, one of the most widely distributed and species-rich groups of amniotes.

"Biological tissue can be very complicated to model. Electrical signals can cause cell contraction, The cells exist in a liquid environment which distributes forces from all surrounding cells. The different components of the system interact since cells respond to pressure, stretch, electrical fields, and chemicals. For example, stretching a cell may alter its electrical function which will then alter contraction. The heart is an example of such a system.

This project aims to build the most complete model of the heart comprising the following components: a geometrically realistic shape, a functioning electrical system including the fast conduction system, mechanical contraction, blood flow, and functioning heart valves. The model will be composed of three distinct and interacting components: an electrical model, a mechanically contracting model, and a blood flow simulator. Mechanisms that provide feedback between the different parts will be included.

The first part of the project will be to build upon an existing model and make it work with more geometrically realistic electrical models. This will properly compute the electrical activation sequence that triggers the mechanical contraction. 

The second part of the project will improve the speed of the model by implementing a new method for solving the blood flow. The grid to compute the fluid will adapt so that it will have a high degree of detail only where interesting things occur. 

Finally, the model will be extended so that the effects of applying large electrical shocks, as delivered by therapeutic devices, can be computed.

This will be the only complete model of the heart. It will be computationally demanding, but by using the most advanced computational techniques, we will reduce much of the burden. It will be a unique tool for the investigation of many  important cardiac phenomena.

"The objective of this application is to acquire an epifluorescence microscope system, including a color CCD camera and software for imaging spatial and temporal expression of proteins (fluorescent tagged) in live zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Live imaging of embryos and larvae is a powerful tool in developmental biology. The optically clear developing zebrafish is an excellent model for imaging studies. My research will trace the origin and migration of cells expressing corticosteroid receptors (CRs), key proteins involved in stress signaling, during development using zebrafish as a model. Defined genetic manipulations of zebrafish embryos by tagging green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) to promoters of CR genes will be followed by morphological, molecular and functional studies to visualize and characterize the corticosteroid signaling during development. A multizoom microscope and imaging system is essential for performing high-resolution in vivo imaging to monitor tissue-specific protein expression and dynamics, as well as cell migration in real time for zebrafish embryos. The fluorescent unit of the microscope and the imaging system will allow monitoring the spatial and temporal distribution of GFP-tagged proteins during development in real time. This equipment is essential for my research program and will be available to researchers at the University of Waterloo.","Multizoom microscope system for live imaging","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal physiology and metabolism"
"Stress is part and parcel of life. One of the acute responses to stress is the production of corticosteroids and this is seen in all vertebrates studied. The predominant corticosteroid produced in response to stress in most vertebrates is cortisol. The stimulation by this steroid hormone brings about several molecular, biochemical and physiological changes, and is consistent with the important role this hormone is thought to play in stress adaptation. However, a cause and effect relationship between stressor exposure and the benefits of this highly conserved steroid response is still lacking. This is because we know so little about the mode of action of this steroid in allowing animals to cope with stress. Cortisol action involves two key proteins, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which relay information that results in gene expression changes (genomic signaling). Recent studies suggest yet another mode of action of cortisol that results in rapid effects, but independent of GR and MR activation (nongenomic signaling). However, the mechanisms are far from clear. This proposal intends to describe the role of these cortisol signaling pathways in the development of corticosteroid production, and stress coping mechanisms. Using zebrafish and rainbow trout, a cause and effect relationship in response to cortisol signaling will be established by using gene knockdown and pharmacological methods. Specifically, using genome and phosphoproteome analyses, this study will identify the regulatory gene and protein networks modified by cortisol signaling in a receptor-dependent and receptor-independent fashion. The overall goal is to discover novel pathways involved in cortisol signaling and will establish a mechanistic link between this steroid secretion and stress adaptation.

"The goal of the proposed research is to develop a microfluidics and biosensor-based platform for the precise and highly sensitive detection of a key stress-related protein, the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), in blood. Heatshock proteins are a family of highly conserved proteins synthesized by all organisms and crucial for normal cellular function and for defending cells against stressors. The 70 kilodalton mass HSP (HSP70) is one of the most widely studied member of this protein family and routinely used as an indicator of cellular stress. Recently, several studies in humans correlated blood levels of HSP70 with disease states, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and trauma, suggesting the utility of this stress protein measurement as a biomarker of compromised health. We also found that higher serum HSP70 levels reflect chronic stress in

grizzly bears, leading to the proposal of using this protein as a marker of health status for wildlife monitoring. Altogether, this highly conserved nature of the protein, its quintessential role in cell function and survival, and reliability as a biomarker of stress in humans and wildlife, makes HSP70 a key protein with diagnostic value for real-time stress/health monitoring. However, detection systems currently used for HSP70 measurement are time-consuming, labour-intensive and requires specialized equipment, making it unsuitable and unrealistic for real-time monitoring. We propose to develop a Biological Micro Electro Mechanical System (BioMEMS) sensor for rapid quantification of HSP70 levels in blood in real-time. This technology is not currently available for stress protein detection in whole organisms. The BioMEMS sensor platform will be fast, efficient, sensitive, cost-effective and portable and can be used in the field for wildlife health monitoring. The proposed

Biosensor platform may also be easily modified to detect other serum protein biomarkers in the future. Overall, development of BioMEMS sensor for HSP70 monitoring will be a key step forward in biomedical technology and will put Canada in the forefront of protein detection systems for diagnosis, and management of human and wildlife health","Integrated bioMEMS (Biological Micro Electro Mechanical System) sensor for real-time heat shock protein 70 monitoring in whole organisms","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical materials"

"Relational databases, with vast amounts of data and complex schemas, are ubiquitous in our society. For example, health care practitioners, financial establishments, insurance companies and government institutions such as Royal Bank, Revenue Canada or Yahoo, to name but a few, are the owners of very large databases which need to be analyzed for trend analysis, fraud detection, customer profiling, privacy-preservation, law enforcement, epidemiological research and so on. The newly emerging field of relational data mining involves the development of new approaches to directly analyze these vast repositories, without requiring extensive transformations by die end user. 



This research focus on the development of a new framework to directly mining relational data. We focus our attention on the development of scalable solutions with high utility. We address the intricacy when considering complex database schemas containing many huge relations. The aim is to not only consider the building of models utilizing information in different relations, but also to explore the links in between them, thus leading to the discovery of novel, interesting knowledge nuggets with high utility.

"Forestry remains one of the most important agents of landscape change in Canada. To be sustainable, forest management practices must maintain ecological services and enough habitat to meet the requirements of the most demanding species associated with our forests. In spite of New Brunswicks long history of forestry, surprisingly few studies have taken advantage of a before-after comparison to determine the response of plants and animals to harvesting. In this study, we will use focal species (songbirds, woodpeckers and lichens growing on trees) to assess the sustainability of harvesting practices used by UPM-Kymmene on public (Crown) forest lands of New Brunswick. To do so, we established study plots in two forest types (acadian and hemiboreal), where we surveyed birds and lichens in the 2 years before experimental harvesting. Treatments (patch cutting in acadian forest; variable retention in hemiboreal forest) are currently being applied. We will resurvey all sites in 2009 and 2010 to measure the response of each indicator species in treatment plots and controls (uncut). The focal species of birds selected use dead/dying trees for nesting, relatively large trees for foraging, and are thought to be sensitive to alterations of their habitat over the larger (landscape) scale. The two lichens have been shown to be sensitive to the opening of the forest by harvesting. Hence, we believe that these species should represent useful indicators of ecologica integrity in these forest types. We will determine whether these species can persist and reproduce successfully in treated plots relative to controls. Because the focal species occur elsewhere in North America (birds) or the northern hemisphere (lichens), our findings should have implications for sustainable forest management in other study regions.","Experimental study of indicator species' response to habitat alteration by forest management","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)",CANADA,CANADA,"Terrestrial ecology"

"This research program addresses applications of logic to computer science. Logic is the formal study of properties; how they can be stated and verified. In computer science, logic allows to formally state properties of computer systems and gives algorithmic methods to efficiently find errors in systems' design. This research program will consider both new verification tasks and new ways of reducing verification time.

In networks such as the Internet, equipments such as routers, switches, firewall etc. must be properly configured in order to exchange information in a secure and efficient way. Maintaining a properly configured network is an expensive and complex task, which takes a great part of network engineers' time. This research program extends logical verification methods to network equipments' configuration. Automating as many configuration tasks as possible, this will allow simplifying and speeding up network configuration tasks.

Propositional logic has been introduced in the 19th century as a calculus for thoughts and has lead to fruitful applications such as in electronic circuits design. Recently fast algorithms for solving propositional formulas have been effectively applied to find errors in computational systems such as network protocols and processors. While being effective, these methods are limited in many cases by the formula's size. This research program considers methods for breaking down these formulas in smaller parts, in order to solve them more rapidly. This will allow error detection in bigger and more realistic computer systems.

"The presence of off-flavours in farm-raised fish represents one of the most significant economic problems

encountered in aquaculture related to product quality. The presence of undesirable odours or tastes in fish may

cause a major reduction in the consumption of the products, or make them unsuitable for sale. Off-flavour

problems have been largely studied in ponds, which are used for the production of catfish in the US, but have

also more recently been detected in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). The off-flavours are due to the

absorption of substances including geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) that are produced by cyanobacteria

and actinomycetes which are normally present in RAS. When present in water, these substances enter through

the gills and accumulate in fat of fish.

The main objective of the proposal is to develop strategies to monitor and prevent the occurrence of geosmin

and MIB in RAS. Our working hypothesis is that it is possible to produce fish in RAS without off-flavours in

the fish flesh by selectively controlling the development of off-flavour producing microorganisms by: (i)

manipulating key operational parameters of RAS, (ii) optimizing diets that reduce off-flavour producing

compounds, and (iii) in the addition of compounds that would selectively eliminate off-flavour-producing

microorganisms that have no effect on wastewater treatment biofilter, and the fish. This will be achieved by (1)

- Identifying and localizing microorganisms responsible for the production of geosmin and MIB; (2) -

developing a technique for real-time non-destructive detection of MIB and geosmin in vivo and compare the

results (sensitivity) with traditional measurement techniques; (3) - Identifying the key environmental,

nutritional and operational parameters involved in the development of microorganisms responsible for the

appearance of off-flavours; and (4) - Increasing the control on microorganisms responsible for off-flavours by

treatment of water with selective compounds to eliminate off-flavours.



Un problï¿½me important en aquaculture, qui est liï¿½ ï¿½ la qualitï¿½ des produits de l'aquaculture d'eau douce, est le

goï¿½t de ""terre ou de boue"" qui se dï¿½veloppe chez les poissons, crustacï¿½s et mollusques. Ce ""mauvais goï¿½t""

rï¿½pugne les consommateurs qui n'achï¿½teront pas le produit. C'est un problï¿½me qui est souvent rencontrï¿½ dans de

vastes systï¿½mes d'ï¿½levage tels les ï¿½tangs, mais aussi dans les systï¿½mes en recirculation. Le mauvais goï¿½t

provient de l'absorption par l'organisme de substances produites par les cyanobactï¿½ries et les actinomycï¿½tes, tel

la gï¿½osmine et le 2-mï¿½thylisobornï¿½ol (MIB). Lorsqu'ils sont prï¿½sents dans l'eau, ces substances pï¿½nï¿½trent ï¿½

Notre hypothï¿½se de travail est qu'il est possible de produire du poisson dans des systï¿½mes en recirculation ou

en circuit-fermï¿½ exempt de mauvais goï¿½t dans leur chair. Ceci pourra se faire en contrï¿½lant le dï¿½veloppement

suivre et prï¿½venir l'apparition de gï¿½osmine et de MIB dans un systï¿½me d'aquaculture en circuit-fermï¿½. L'atteinte

de cet objectif (1) se fera par :

2 - le dï¿½veloppement d'une technique de dï¿½tection en temps rï¿½el in vivo et du MIB/gï¿½osmine dans les poissons,

It is motivated by both prototypical experimental configurations in which to address fundamental issues of nonlinear phenomena, and by specific applications in condensed matter physics and engineering. Two main avenues are pursued: the motion of topological defects in mesophases and structure coarsening, and a mesoscopic model of a diblock copolymer to study the formation, evolution, and rheology of lamellar phases under shear. In the first case, we are motivated by recent results about processing nanostructured, layered phases, and their nonequilibrium evolution mediated by topological defect motion.

"Can we design an artificial intelligence system that, once plunged in an unknown world, like a newborn baby opening his eyes for the first time, would be able to form high level concepts exclusively from the enormous quantity of raw sensory information that it receives? Such a system should be able to discover deep regularities and stable structures in this ever changing information stream, so that it may eventually form its own subjective notions of space, time, of things (more or less stable entities) moving around. This research program aims at exploring new fundamental principles to guide the building of next generation autonomous learning systems with this kind of abilities. Our approach will be based on computer implementations capable of growing ""layers of understanding"", stacked one upon the other. Each such layer shall be building a slightly higher level ""understanding"" of the representation extracted by the previous one, by exploiting regularities that the previous layer failed to capture. We intend to focus on a particular class of regularities called ""invariant transformations"", that we want to automatically discover and learn. The layer by layer extraction of ever higher level, ever more meaning carrying representations, is expected to be a key element for opening the door to near human-level performance in artificial learning systems (thus advancing the state-of-the-art in the fields of machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining). It is also expected to produce computerized systems capable of far more accurate predictions from past observed data. This would have direct technological applications in a wide range of fields where superior prediction systems are immensely useful: from engineering to finance, from business decision making to medicine.

"The increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of human activities has begun to affect aquatic ecosystems throughout the world, and polar lakes, rivers and coastal waters appear to be especially vulnerable. My Discovery Grant research is focused on the interactions between the physical environment and microscopic communities at the base of freshwater and coastal marine food webs, with the long term goal of a predictive understanding of how climate controls the microbial structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Over the next 5-year cycle we will continue to focus our research in Nunavut and Nunavik, with complementary studies in the laboratory and on local lakes and reservoirs. We will continue our emphasis on cyanobacteria, which we have previously shown to be a major and often dominant component of high latitude aquatic ecosystems. Building on our past results, we will undertake sets of projects on three ecosystem types that can be differentiated in terms of their cyanobacterial and other microbial characteristics. i) Far northern lakes and fiords dominated by picoplanktonic (small cell) organisms. By way of molecular (DNA-and RNA-based) techniques, field analyses and laboratory culture studies we will address questions about the external input of microbiota from snowpacks, how reductions in ice-cover affect these ecosystems and what factors control microbial community structure. ii) Thaw lakes in subarctic Quï¿½bec and mesotrophic lakes in southern Quï¿½bec. By way of experiments and field observations we will examine how these ecosystems may shift to dominance by noxious, bloom-forming cyanobacteria. iii) Shallow high latitude lakes in which total ecosystem biomass and productivity are dominated by bottom-dwelling mat communities, largely composed of filamentous cyanobacteria. We will address hypotheses concerning the assembly and activity of these consortia, and will combine this work with microsensor assays and stable isotope probing to assess climate impacts. This overall research program will provide new insights into how aquatic ecosystems respond to climate forcing, and advanced training in microbial ecology, limnology and northern climate change research.

These living systems are vulnerable to environmental impacts, and are sentinels of global climate change. This request is for funds to help meet the logistic costs associated with our ongoing NSERC Discovery Grant research on the complex question of how northern aquatic ecosystems respond to changes in regional and global climate. Our research will take place at three sets of sites. Most of our research is based out of Ward Hunt Island, Quttinirpaaq National Park, Nunavut, and focuses on ice-dependent lakes and other coastal aquatic ecosystems as indicators of climate change, and as models of ecological survival under environmental extremes. Part of our research will be on lakes in the Resolute Bay area to examine the community structure and function of microbes in the three domains of life (Bacteria, including cyanobacteria; Archaea, including ammonium-oxidizers; and microbial Eukarya). The third set of sites will be on permafrost thaw lakes near Kuujjuarapik, Nunavik, to examine impacts of climate warming. The research program will provide advanced training of students, postdoctoral researchers and technicians, and the results will be communicated to northern communities and other members of the public via reports (including translations into Inuktitut), public presentations, ongoing liaison with schools, TV, radio, newspapers and the internet. Our participation within ArcticNet provides opportunities for collaboration across and within sectors, exchange of data and information via the ArcticNet/CCIN initiative ""Polar Data Catalogue"" (www.polardata.ca), and communication with northern stakeholders via the Inuit Circumpolar Conference and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.

"How the intestine absorbs and transports  dietary fats is major area where we need greater understanding of the basic physiological processes involved. Emerging evidence suggests the intestine  contributes significantly to whole body cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism,  yet there remains a lack of knowledge regarding the regulation of intestinal lipid absorption, and transport of dietary lipids to the circulation via intestinal lipoproteins (chylomicrons). We know a lot about the liver and how it handles lipids, but we have limited knowledge about how the intestine regulates lipid metabolism. I and others have contributed to the understanding that dietary lipid content can alter intestinal absorption and metabolism of chylomicrons. Recent evidence suggests that specific intestinal transporters are involved in lipid absorption and production of intestinal chylomicrons, and these processes may be intrinsically linked with insulin metabolism. The principle objective of my research program is to establish the physiological relationship between intestinal lipid absorption,  chylomicron production,  and insulin status, and the role dietary lipids may play in modulating these processes. The scientific strategy is to use an integrated approach with complimentary techniques which are unique to my laboratory to investigate the 'absorption to secretion' axis of lipid metabolism in the intestine. It is envisioned that this research program will provide mechanistic insights into how the intestine processes dietary fat, and how it adapts or modulates intestinal lipid transport processes in different metabolic and dietary conditions.","The relationship between intestinal lipid transport processes, insulin metabolism, and modulation by dietary lipids","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)",CANADA,CANADA,"Life sciences research related to human health and disease"
"The main goal of my research program is to discover ecological drivers of aquatic food-web responses to global change. Multiple human-related stressors that define global change often exert complex non-additive effects on food webs, which cannot therefore be easily predicted based on the sum of known effects by single stressors. Consequently, extreme climate change together with other stressors often generate alarming ""ecological surprises."" I have developed a conceptual model of the ecological mechanisms affecting multi-trophic responses to multiple stressors. The model is based on three operating hypotheses: 1) stressors exert more pronounced synergistic impacts on top predators than on plants because animals are less tolerant of rapid environmental change, 2) tolerant plant species more than top predators are able to readily colonize stressed ecosystems and functionally compensate for extinct species, and thus, 3) differences in tolerances among top predators, herbivores, and plants result in their interactions (e.g., predation and herbivory) being profoundly altered in stressed ecosystems. My research group tests these hypotheses by conducting experiments in naturally fishless alpine lakes of the Canadian Rockies, which are being increasingly impacted by extreme climate events, introduced invasive species, and air pollution. Therefore, these highly sensitive species-poor ecosystems are excellent venues for investigating the effects of multiple stressors on trophic complexity. We examine the responses of whole food webs, single trophic groups and their interactions by exposing them sequentially to summer heating events and other stressors using submersible greenhouse mesocosms. We also examine the importance of dispersal and colonization by tolerant species as a means of buffering alpine food webs against the impacts of rapid environmental change. I refine and upgrade my proposed model through comparison of experimental and naturally occurring food webs in alpine lakes that are exposed to the same combination of stressors. Our findings will help better explain why we should expect the unexpected from future global change.

"Ventricular myocardial infarction and ischemia account for 18% of mortality in Canada. Lethal cardiac arrhythmias induced by ischemia account for the majority of deaths in the acute setting. The resting membrane potential and ion concentration differences across the cell membrane are maintained by ion pumps and exchangers. Upon impaired blood flow, oxygen and energy sources are depleted and extracellular potassium (K+o) accumulates such that the resting membrane potential (Vm) depolarises, resulting in a current flow between the healthy and ailing tissue. This current, in conjunction with altered electrical coupling is thought to act as a trigger for self-sustaining reentrant waves and ventricular arrhythmias 

Atrial fibrillation (AF), which has become the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia, also arises from reentrant waves. The sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac nervous systems can act in synergy to induce AF. It is believed that adrenergic neuronal activation favours abnormal automaticity, providing a trigger for the arrhythmia. Moreover, cholinergic inputs enhance the spatial heterogeneity of refractory period, thereby promoting the onset of reentry.  This proposal addresses the modelling aspect of two ongoing research projects on neurally induced AF in canine preparation and ischemia in human. Abnormal impulse formation and entrainment response will be studied in mathematical models of both types of preparation using numerical simulation","Abnormal automaticity and complex entrainment in cardiac cell and tissue models","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical engineering"

"The  goal of this project is to further understand the structure of random matrices and their relationships with other areas of probability, mathematics and science in general.The theory of random matrices originates in two distinct applications: the structure of large data sets, whose study was initiated by statisticians in the 1930's, and the structure of atomic nuclei, studied by the Nobel laurate Eugene Wigner in the 1950s. Our work will answer questions raised by Wigner and Dyson at the onset of this theory.



Since then, random matrix eigenvalues became a central tool for understanding wireless communications in  electrical engineering, and for the description of  large financial data sets by financial mathematicians.  In mechanical engineering, random matrix eigenvalues are used to understand the resonances in, for example,

car components.



The PI has developed a new approach to random matrices via stochastic calculus, 

a randomized version of calculus widely used in computing option prices. The PI would

like to use this approach to solve long-standing open problems in the theory, as well as

to understand the statistical properties of the Riemann Zeta function, on of the central 

misteries of mathematics.

"The recognition of action is considered to be a fundamental prerequisite for the  development of imitation, motor learning and social gesture.  In humans the discovery of mirror neurons, which respond to both the observation and execution of an action, have been found suggesting a common coding between perception and action. There are, however, a number of questions not accounted for by the current mirror neuron system interpretation.  For example, since the mirror neurons provide a motor representation of action, would these neurons be activated if the action represented implied biological motion, or if the action represented ""impossible biological motion?""   Furthermore, how do the mirror neurons respond to actions that have a strong emotional/social component, i.e. how is an action representing a person running away in fear, compare with a person simply jogging? 

    The goal of this proposal is to investigate these questions in order to better elucidate the fundamental neural basis of action understanding.  I will address these questions by measuring brain responses using magnetoencephalography (MEG).   With its millisecond temporal resolution, MEG is particularly suited to the analysis of the neural networks underlying action representation. The experiments outlined in this proposal will explore the link between action, perception and intention, in relation to the underlying cortical networks involved in the mirror neuron system and will provide new insights into the nature of perceptual-motor processing.","The neural basis of action understanding",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Cognitive science -- fundamental"

"The Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) is a proposed supernova neutrino detector for SNOLAB. HALO is a long term, low cost, high livetime, and low maintenance, dedicated supernova detector. This grant request is for the capital funds to deploy an initial phase of HALO along with two years of operating funds and R&D funding for the design of a detector of at least 10 times the sensitivity of the initial phase. 

   A type II supernova is powered by the energy liberated in the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star. The core is transformed to a hot proto-neutron star that rapidly cools, by the emission of neutrinos, in some tens of seconds. In fact, about 99% of the energy is released in the form of ~ 10 MeV neutrinos. Direct measurement of the time evolution of the luminosity, flavour partition, and average neutrino energy are our best experimental window into the challenging field of supernova dynamics which would lead to an improved understanding of supernovae and of fundamental neutrino properties.

   The HALO detector takes advantage of the low cost, high neutrino cross-section and low neutron absorption cross-section of lead.  Neutrino interactions in lead expel neutrons from the lead nuclei making a burst of detected neutrons the signature for the detection of a supernova. The concept for HALO is a volume of lead instrumented with neutron detectors. While other supernova detectors are primarily sensitive to electron antineutrinos HALO is sensitive to electron neutrinos through the charged current interaction and to all flavours through the neutral current interaction. These sensitivities ensure that supernova data from HALO would contribute to unravelling the supernova neutrino signal and extracting physics from the next galactic supernova.

   HALO benefits from having ""on hand"" 80 tonnes of lead, from the decommissioning of the Deep River Cosmic Ray Station, and approximately 600 meters of 3He neutron detectors from the final phase of the SNO experiment.  These assets will be used to mount Phase I of HALO in SNOLAB.

"Magnetic fields are found almost everywhere in the universe, and play a vital role in the creation of high energy particles, the accretion of gas onto black holes, and the formation of stars.  Nevertheless there is considerable controversy regarding their origins and an equal amount of uncertainty with regard to  their behavior, which in turn implies a great deal of uncertainty in our understanding of a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena.  There is general agreement that the origin and evolution of magnetic fields are closely tied to the turbulent motions of gas in the interstellar medium and inside stars.  Here we propose to study several key processes connected to magnetic fields and star formation.  One of these is the general process of magnetic field formation (i.e. dynamo activity)  in conducting fluids, which means almost all hot gases including stars, accretion disks and the interstellar medium. This is directly connected to the origin of galactic magnetic fields and in particular the question of whether or not strong and well organized fields arise quickly once galaxies form, as observations indicate, or whether we must appeal to exotic physical processes in the early universe to understand the evolution of galactic magnetic fields.  Second, if we visualize magnetic fields as composed of ""field lines"" then a commonly noted paradox is that these field lines appear to ""reconnect"", or switch attachments, without much difficulty both inside and outside of stars.  Although there has been a great deal of work on undrstanding magnetic reconnection in low density environments, like the interstellar medium, this work does not help us understand magnetic reconnection inside stars.  I have been studying the effects of turbulence on this process and will conduct a series of numerical experiments to test previously published ideas on fast magnetic reconnection in turbulent fluids.   Third, I will apply the work on dynamos and reconnection to the generation and transport of magnetic fields in disks, which are critical for quasars and star formation.   Finally, I will examine the interplay between magnetic fields and fluid instabilities in the early stages of star formation.

"Light emitted and reflected by objects provides us with much useful information about our surroundings. In addition to its wavelength and intensity, one very useful property of an optical beam is its polarization state, or the orientation of the electric field vector perpendicular to the propagation direction. When light travels through an object, its polarization state will be changed. Hence the properties of the object can be obtained through the change in the polarization state. We propose to extend our research into polarized light interactions with turbid materials.  The long-term goal of the research is to perform polarized light assessment of biological tissues.

  The numerous deflections experienced by the light in such materials will scramble its polarization such that there may not be any useful information left to extract. However, we and others have shown that a surprising amount of useful polarization information can be retained upon multiple scattering. The proposed methodology will quantify polarization loss in turbid media at many different wavelengths. These methods can then be used to characterize turbid systems such as planetary atmospheres, biological tissues, or amorphous semiconductors.

  It is also proposed to investigate the effects of the ""chirality"" of the turbid medium. Chirality refers to the asymmetry of some materials, which casues them to interact with polarized light in distinctive ways. These interactions have long been used in TRANSPARENT media to probe the details of  its molecular structure and composition. The proposed work is novel in its intent to quantify chiral effects in optically thick TURBID media thru polarization analysis of multiply scattered light. We will build upon our current expertise in polarimetry and expand our research efforts to incorporate multi-wavelength effects. We will then assess the feasibility of polarimetric non-invasive glucose monitoring in diabetic patients (as glucose is a chiral molecule). This is an important outstanding challenge in clinical medicine, and our proposed polarization studies are well poised to contribute toward its successful resolution.

"Statistical process  control has a wide range of applications in industry, services, administration and other areas. The statistical methods required depend on both the questions being asked and the features of the process quality data. The overall objective is to improve process performance. Control charts are the core methods used in statistical process control. Their development has largely focused on fault signatures characterized by a jump, up- or down-wards, in the mean of a quality characteristic in the manufacturing of a product or the offering of a service. Single-step slippages in the process controling variables are often responsible for these fault signatures. In practice, however, more often the mean of the quality characteristic of interest drifts away slowly, constantly changing over time. Linear, quadratic, exponential and sinusoidal trends are not uncommonly observed in process operation. Naturally these fault signatures are buried in noise, thus directly unobservable. Our proposal's main objective is to develop control chart methods to detect this variety of fault signatures. Specifically, the aim is to develop fault-sensitized control charts, that is, charts that are highly efficient in detecting a fault signature feared in advance. The recent control chart literature has focused on this type of problems. Another important objective is to develop charts for situations where the quality of interest does not necessarily follow a normal distribution. These situations are very common in reliability studies where the failure times of products or parts tend to be (positively) skewed, or in environmental studies where the concentrations of contaminants are in many cases log-normally distributed. We will apply sound statistical methods based on likelihood functions and score statistics to tackle these problems.

"In recent years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have attracted great attention of the research community thanks to their tremendous potential in various application fields, including environment monitoring, security surveillance and disaster management, combat operations. A typical WSN setup assumes one or more of the following:

(1) sensor nodes are randomly scattered throughout the deployment field, e.g. by being disseminated from a plane;

(2) the deployment field is a region of irregular geographic composition, possibly comprising natural obstacles (lakes, cliffs, etc.) or man-made obstacles (buildings, overpasses, etc.);

(3) sensor nodes are small, inexpensive, wireless and battery-powered devices prone to failure due to: component malfunctioning, battery depletion, environmental factors (e.g. extreme heat, flooding, freezing), man-caused factors (e.g. interference, accidental damage, explosion).

Based on the above, the WSN topology inevitably gets plagued by serious irregularities and/or areas completely void of functioning nodes - a.k.a. holes. Clearly, the existence of such topological anomalies has a major negative impact on both, the network function (sensing of certain phenomenon) and operation (routing of data).

Given that WSNs find their use in a number of critical applications, it is clear that the inability of these networks to operate correctly (or efficiently) in the presence of topological anomalies may cause damage to the human health and safety, and result in considerable financial loss. Accordingly, the main objective of the work proposed in this document is to advance the current state of research and application of WSNs, by devising new effective techniques of self-healing and fault-tolerance.

"Glycoconjugates are key biomolecular structures within organisms that are composed of several different interlinked sugar units attached to either lipids or proteins.  Within vertebrates there are only ten fundametal sugar units that make up such structures yet, remarkably, it is estimated that approximately 300 genes within the human genome are dedicated to enzymes responsible for the assembly and coordinated processing of these complex glycoconjugates.  The allocation of so many genes to the proper stepwise assembly and dissasembly of glycoconjugates makes sense in the context of the great information afforded by such structures and the realization that approximately half of all proteins are glycosylated. The purpose of this regulated structural glycodiversity lies in its ability to modulate protein function, mediate molecular interactions, as well as to alter the physical properties and stability of proteins.  Within vertebrates, many different glycan structures are known but this proposal focuses on three lesser appreciated and investigated forms of O-glycosylation. Despite knowledge of these glycoforms for over 20 years there has been limited progress in elucidating their functional roles in biology.  This limited progress stems, in large part, from the lack of molecular and chemical tools available for probing these glycan structures and the inability to identify the majority of enzymes responsible for their biosynthesis. Accordingly, the long term program of research described here outlines the development and implementation of a number of chemical and biochemical tools that can be used to eventual decode the molecular role of these forms of O-glycosylation.","Chemical strategies for studying o-glycosylation","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Bio-organic chemistry"

"The termini of linear eukaryotic chromosomes, known as telomeres, resemble DNA double-helix interruptions, the most dangerous among DNA lesions that threaten the integrity of the genome. While chromosomal breaks are immediately subjected to DNA repair, such repair attempts at telomeres can lead to loss of genetic information, genome instability, cellular transformation and, ultimately, cell death. Paradoxically, several proteins involved in sensing and repair of chromosomal breaks reside at telomeres and assist in their maintenance. Our research goal is to define the molecular features that distinguish telomeres from genomic DNA breaks and how DNA repair activities are controlled at telomeres throughout the cell cycle. 

The baker's yeast is recognized as an ideal model eukaryote microorganism for dissecting basic biological phenomena. Much of their versatility as a model organism stems from their ability to propagate in both stable haploid and diploid states, which facilitates the genetic manipulations. These manipulations often require physical isolation of a single cell or separation of the four recombinant haploid spores that represent the meiotic progeny of a diploid, technique known as tetrad dissection, to allow individual cell germination and further analyses. Although laborious and time consuming, tetrad dissection is the sole procedure allowing unambigous indetification of individual meiotic products. The use of modern microscopes coupled to high-precision tetrad micromanipulator devices considerably facilitates the microdissection and single-cell analyses in yeast. Thus, this piece of equpiment is indespensible for a contemporary yeast laboratory conducting genetic analyses involving manipulation of multiple genetic loci.

The proposed studies are expected to advance our current knowledge on fundamental issues in biology, such as chromosome architecture, dynamics and maintenance. In particular, they are expected to generate novel and exciting findings with regard to telomere protection and chromosome stability, adding new information about the causes for telomere-initiated genome instability, a common prelude to cancer in humans.

"The transmission of genetic information during cell division requires the coordination of three critical events; first, the attachment of chromosomes to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle, second the application of forces that pull chromosomes towards the poles of the cell and away from spindle mid-zone and third, the coordination of completion of these events with the onset of cytokinesis. The kinetochore is a complex structure of proteins that is associated with the centromeres of chromosomes. While the structure and organization of the centromere and kinetochore is diverse among eukaryotes, they play an evolutionarily conserved and central role in attaching chromosomes to microtubules in all cell types. Chromosome attachment, or bi-orientation, is an error prone process. The kinetochore is not only required to segregate the chromosomes, but also to report the status of attachment. Bi-orientation of all the chromosomes results in tension on the spindle, and is required for entry into anaphase. Defects in bi-orientation result in lack of tension on the spindle, and are reported locally; a defect at one chromosome is sufficient to trigger a) the repair of defective attachments, and if repair is incomplete b) activation of a cell cycle checkpoint that delays entry into anaphase. The mechanism of repair, and the requirement for the kinetochore for in checkpoint activation is well established. Once the checkpoint is activated, the cell cycle delay must be maintained until all attachments have been repaired.  In the last several years, proteins of the central kinetochore (CK) have emerged as candidates for coordinating repair with checkpoint control. However, the mechanism by which repair and checkpoint functions are coupled is less understood. The goal of this project is to understand how the repair and checkpoint functions of CK proteins are controlled in cells.

"The cell surface is the interface between cells and their environment. Interactions at this interface enable cells to generate movement, to assume specific shapes, to carry out specific functions, and to form multicellular structures. It is not surprising that major elements of the cytoskeleton within animal cells are related to the cell surface, particularly to regions of the surface involved in forming connections both with neighboring cells and with supporting substrates. The long-term objective of my research program is to explore the interaction between intercellular junctions and the cytoskeleton in cells within the context of tissues, and determine how the two systems function together to generate complex remodeling events in cell layers (epithelia) that line the many tubes and cavities in animals. We are particularly interested in how the cytoskeleton and junctions interact to allow cells to detach from their neighbors and to move through epithelia from one compartment of the body to another. Over the next few years we will explore the mechanism by which the cytoskeleton and junctions function to (1) move developing sperm cells through the seminiferous epithelium of the mammalian testis, and (2) release fully formed sperm cells from this epithelium. We will focus on cytoskeleton-related tubular structures that we propose are sub-cellular machines that internalize and degrade intact intercellular junctions during the extensive epithelial remodeling events that occur during the production of sperm cells. Our results will generate a paradigm shift in how biologists view junction disassembly in the seminiferous epithelium and will provide a new model for sperm release and for turnover of the ""blood-testis barrier"".

"The overall objective is to open up the frequency spectrum between 100 GHz and 200 GHz for silicon integrated circuits and systems on chip. To reach this goal, this research proposes a two-pronged approach with focus on a) semiconductor device characterization and modelling in the 100-GHz to 500-GHz range and b) on the development of integrated circuits and entire systems on a silicon chip, including antennas, operating at frequencies in the 100-GHz to 200-GHz range.

The device work will investigate two fundamental phenomena important for the understanding of future nanoscale devices: a) the noise sources and the noise modelling of sub-45nm MOSFETs and 500-GHz SiGe HBTs at frequencies beyond 100 GHz and b) the scaling of the characteristic current densities (peak fT, peak fMAX and optimum noise figure) in non-classical CMOS and applications to variability-robust 100+ GHz circuit design.

The circuit research will pursue: (i) scalable radio transceivers operating in the 100-GHz to 200-GHz range for wireless chip-to-chip communication at 10 to 40 Gb/s data-rates, and (ii)  amplitude-to-frequency converters based on 100+GHz VCOs with linear wideband (>10 GHz) tuning characteristics. 

I will rely on established international relationships with leading semiconductor foundries  to access 45nm, 32nm and 22nm CMOS and SiGe BiCMOS technologies, and on the testing capabilities up to 220 GHz that I have developed at the University of Toronto.

"People become sensitive to the structural regularities in everyday experiences through incidental exposure to individual examples.  Thus, we develop sensitivity to other people's personal styles and the styles in the works of individual artists and composers, a sense of what does and does not belong to a particular genre of writing, the likely conclusion to and appropriate sequences of a favorite televison series, what drivers in then left lane are likely to do that drivers in the right are not, and what a normal interaction with a teller at our bank is like.  Often this sensitivity develops effortlessly and without any intention on our part to learn these regularities, and even without any awareness that there are any such regularities to learn.  Yet, both common experience and laboratory research alike demonstrate that this tacit sensitivity influences our performance and expectations in virtually every task we undertake.  Many non-human animals, such as chimpanzees, rats, pigeons, and even fish can demonstrate similar sensitivities to style in art, music, and even handwriting.  The proposed research explores the source of this tacit, structural knowledge and how it comes to influence our performance in classification, recognition, and recall, and how it influences our and other animal's  biases and preferences.  Previous research suggests that the knowledge that is the source of these influences is not in the form of high-level abstractions such as rules or prototypes, but rather remains latent in and distributed over our memory for specific episodes of experience.  These memories are recruited collectively in response to a similar current event to provide a feeling of familiarity or ""rightness"" or a fluidity to our responding to events consistent with the structure of those we've experienced in similar situations.  This retrieval also provides for the ability to detect when an event is inconsistent with structure, even if we are unable to articulate how we ""know"" it.  The proposed research explores a model of such memory and retrieval processes that would allow for this implicit learning and use of structure in both people and animals. The model is in the form of artificial neural network applied to low-level representations of the individual events, such as pixel-maps of images or digitised sounds.

"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a fundamental organelle involved in the biosynthesis of membrane and secreted proteins. Abnormal ER function can lead to adverse effects in cells and induce cell death. ER stress can be caused by a variety of factors depending on the cell type. Pancreatic beta-cells that synthesize and secrete insulin for instance are very susceptible to saturated fat, which can induce stress in this cell compartment. While studying the gene expression changes that are induced when stress is prevalent in the ER, we discovered that a protein named SDF2L1 is abundantly induced. However, the function of this protein in the ER stress response is unknown. This proposal plans to examine the role of this protein in the ER stress response using insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells as the model system. Discovering the function of this protein the ER stress response will lead to a greater molecular understanding of this vital cellular system.","Role of SDF2L1 and protein O-mannosylation in the ER stress response","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Cell secretion"

"Accurate quantification of small amounts of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) is crucial for gene expression evaluation using real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and starting with wrong concentrations may strongly compromise the results of downstream applications which are often labor-intensive, time-consuming and highly expensive. Nucleic acid quantification cannot be performed by traditional spectrophotometry when the amounts of samples are limited. Small volume spectrophotometers enable highly accurate analyses of extremely small samples with high reproducibility.

A small volume spectrophotometer will enable Drs. Volkoff and Marshall to maintain successful research programs within the Department of Biology at Memorial University of Newfoundland.  Both researchers have been using qPCR increasingly since the acquisition of a real time PCR system, through a NSERC RTI grant in 2007.  Dr. Volkoff uses qPCR to examine the effects of physiological or environmental factors parameters on food intake and on the gene transcript levels of appetite-related hormones in fish. Dr. Marshall uses genomic qPCR to examine the genetic basis of inherited diseases in wild foxes.  Both research programs could have an important impact on the proper management of fish and mammalian species within the province of Newfoundland. The requested equipment will allow to increase the efficiency and the quality of Dr. Volkoff's and Dr. Marshall's research programs and help train highly qualified students. As the equipment will be located in a common facility within the Biology Department, a number of molecular biologists from different disciplines as well as students will also benefit from this equipment.

"In vertebrates, complex hormonal networks regulate feeding, energy homeostasis and growth. Hypothalamic factors such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexins and cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) ultimately control these functions by either stimulating or decreasing appetite. Other hormones, in particular gastrointestinal hormones such as amylin and cholecystokinin are released in the circulation and reach the brain where they can modulate the actions of these central factors. Environmental factors (e.g. temperature) might also affect feeding and appetite-related factors. In addition, given the link between energy reserves and reproduction, these central feeding regulators might also be influenced by reproductive events and be important regulators of reproduction.

To date, there is limited information on the endocrine regulation of feeding and energy metabolism in fish.  The goal of this program is to identify the molecules and mechanisms regulating feeding in fish, to assess their interactions and to examine how they are modulated by environmental factors and reproductive events.  We intend to characterize uninvestigated peptides, including orexin, CART and amylin in fish, with respect to their nature and their role in feeding and reproduction.  Research will be conducted at various levels of organization, from molecular to the whole animal.  Techniques used include brain stereotaxic injections followed by behavioral observations and molecular techniques such as cDNA cloning and gene expression studies. Research will focus on goldfish and marine fish species (e.g. cod, flounder and skate) that have not been investigated in the past.  

Developing a better understanding of how food intake and growth are regulated by hormonal and environmental factors in fish might prove especially important to the aquaculture industry.  Also, this research could contribute to the comprehension of the mechanisms that rule states of dysregulation of energy homeostasis in mammals such as obesity.

"One of the most interesting problems facing modern cosmology concerns the nature of the dark matter that has been ""observed"" in galaxies and galactic clusters. In a recent paper I suggested that gravitational geons could be a candidate for the dark matter. Gravitational geons are nonsingular particle-like structures in the gravitational field. It is well known that general relativity does not admit gravitational geons. However, it is likely that general relativity will receive corrections at large curvatures and the modified field equations may admit solutions corresponding to geons. In a recent paper I showed that modifications to certain theories in two spacetime dimensions leads to equations that admit geons. It would be of significant interest to see if gravitational geons also exist in modifications of general relativity in four spacetime dimensions. I plan to examine  modifications of the gravitational field equations in four dimensions to see if they admit geon solutions.

 There are solutions to general relativity that describe a warp bubble, a region of space that moves at superluminal velocity relative to the distant stars. It has been shown that within general relativity and quantum field theory the wall of the warp bubble must be very thin and contain an unphysical amount of negative energy. I will examine warp bubbles in modified theories of gravity to see if these problems can be overcome.

 The discovery that black holes have entropy has led to many deep insights into quantum processes in curved space-time, connections between black holes and thermodynamics, and quantum gravity. I plan to study black hole entropy in alternative formulations of general relativity using the operational definition of black hole entropy. In this approach a thin spherical shell is contracted reversibly from infinity down to just above its black hole radius. In Einstein's theory the entropy of the shell is one-quarter of its area in the black hole limit for a broad class of equations of state. I will generalize this approach and apply it to various modified theories of gravity and compare the results to those obtained using different methods.

"Although my research program touches on a number of different aspects of statistics and probability theory, my work revolves around a single theme: asymptotics (expansion of a statistic or of a distribution). My research deals with the following main themes: 

1. Rectification (further asymptotic expansion) of formulae of coverage probabilities by confidence sets centered at James-Stein and positive-part James-Stein shrinkage estimates.

2. Construction of statistical models for a two-sided crack development for a two-sided cyclic loading of a metallic plate (models of a two-sided Birnbaum-Saunders distribution). Solution of statistical problems of parameter estimation and hypothesis testing for these new models.

3. Consistency problems of some nonclassical bootstrap procedures, especially the asymptotic probability for the deviations of dependent bootstrap means from the sample mean.

4. Guaranteed statistical inference for various schemes of asymptotic analysis. For the problem of statistical quality control, values of the parameter under control should be always considered as a realization of a random variable. The traditional procedures of the control (that ignore this information), usually do not guarantee that a small proportion of defective products are delivered to the consumer, nor that a small proportion of good products get rejected. We can suggest the following, more reliable procedure of guaranteed quality control that guarantee the given constraints on the proportion of defective production delivered to a consumer, and on the proportion of good production that was rejected at the control. The stopping time of the control is achieved if either the posterior probability of the event that the product is defective is less than the given constraint, or the posterior probability of the event that the product is good becomes smaller than another given constraint. The problem is to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the necessary sample size in the framework of this approach to guarantee statistical inference.

"Social and economic drivers underlay most conservation issues. Focusing exclusively on manifest ecological issues while ignoring their socio-economic forcing factors is akin to treating the symptom while ignoring the disease. In the marine realm this is most evident in seafood where human demand runs against the ecological limitations of production. This research program seeks to build research capacity towards generating high quality primary and applied research products with direct policy relevance. The initial phase of building this capacity will focused on issues associated with aquaculture. Specifically issues dealing with parasite transfer between wild and farm populations and the risks related to exotic species.","Meeting the challenge of marine sustainability",Aquaculture,CANADA,CANADA,"Evolution and ecology"
"Forests cover more than a quarter of the land area of the planet. In Canada, 250 million hectares are treed. Softwoods, or conifers, produce pulp and lumber, both of which are important components of our economy. To ensure regeneration of these forests, government and industry annually plant more than 720 million trees. Only 10 % of these are from seed that has been genetically selected and improved by breeding programs. Limitations in orchard production, limitations in reproduction technologies due to pests, pathology and mismanagement, all play a role. 

     My present focus has been to look at conifer reproduction in depth, in particular focusing on the events up to and including fertilization. From pollination to fertilization in flowering plants is usually a matter of a few days. In conifers and other gymnosperms it is never less than a week and in at least a dozen genera this period is a year or more. The explanation for such prolonged pollen growth must lie in the substances that pollen encounters along the path from the entrance of the ovule to the egg. My lab is investigating this pathway using molecular tools that elucidate protein and gene expression. The open ovule defends itself against microbes that fly in with the airborne pollen - this defensive shield is based on pathogenesis-related proteins. Mass spectrometry has allowed us to identify many such proteins in many gymnosperms. We are also developing methods to verify their function during reproduction. The pollen's growth is through a tissue that also mediates pollen-ovule interaction. By creating gene expression libraries we will study how this barrier functions in regulating pollen growth. Finally, we wish to begin a study of fertilization by focusing on the egg. This will include a study of egg protein composition using mass spectrometry and multiple reaction monitoring mass spec imaging methods. Losses among conifers to egg abortion are quite high: it represents is a substantial loss during reproduction. As abortion can be overridden by a parasitic insect, we intend to investigate the proteins involved in egg and embryo losses.

"My proposed research deals with the study of how we perceive various kinds of motion stimuli and how attentional processes can influence this perception. In the past, I have demonstrated an intimate relationship, between the two. A new direction is to study motion perception and attention also when the observers walk or run while performing perceptual tasks. This includes analyses of eye and head movement patterns.

1. Motion & attention. It is currently accepted that motion stimuli are analyzed at various levels (cortical and sub-cortical). This implies that motion stimuli will lead to neural activity in several areas, each contributing to the overall percept. I propose to continue the study of how motion stimuli are processed concurrently at the various levels. This will be done by measuring static and dynamic motion aftereffects (MAEs; the illusory perception of motion after prolonged exposure to a moving stimulus) and their interocular transfers (IOT; adaptation and test stimuli are presented to different eyes). In particular, I will study the relationship between MAE and motion fading (a selective slowing of motion without fading of the spatial aspects of the stimulus) with the same adaptation stimuli in the same observers in order to examine whether the underlying mechanisms are the same. Luminance- and contrast-modulated stimuli will be used. 

As a metaphor for selective attention, properties of the 'attentional spotlight' (the restricted area where sensitization occurs) will be examined, with particular emphasis on the conditions for splitting of the spotlight (i.e., two spatially distinct areas of sensitization).

2. Locomotion. The approach here is based on the premise that most visual tasks outside the laboratory are performed by an actively moving observer and that vision is intimately tied to action. Observers will therefore be standing, walking or running on a treadmill while performing various visual and visuomotor tasks with stimuli presented on a large projection screen. Eye and head movement patterns will be examined with respect to compensation accuracy, spatial and temporal fixation distributions and their variation with the types of task.

"Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), which couple oxidation of organic carbon or hydrogen to reduction of sulfate to sulfide, are widespread in anaerobic soils and sediments and are key catalysts in the global carbon and sulfur cycles. The impact of SRB in resource-based industries is profound and can be positive (mining: remediation of acid waste) or negative (oil and gas: corrosion and lowering of product quality). The study of SRB is facilitated by the fact that several genome sequences are now available, including that of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH), isolated from anaerobic clay soil. 

DvH has 4 periplasmic hydrogenases, enzymes that consume or produce hydrogen gas. We have shown that this diversity is needed for efficient growth at high and at low hydrogen concentrations, for hydrogen cycling during growth on lactate, and for hydrogen metabolism during corrosion of iron. 

The effects of nitrite and oxygen stress (1% air) have also been determined and this has led to a bioenergetic model for sulfate reduction and the definition of the roles of key enzymes for survival in air. Some of the genes involved were found to be located on a 47 kb genomic island (GEI), that is easily deleted from the DvH genome. The resulting GEI-minus strain has superior growth kinetics under anaerobic conditions, whereas the GEI-plus strain survives better during nitrite and oxygen stress. 

In our proposed future work we will capitalize on the growing number of available genome sequences and use microarray hybridization, mutagenesis and bioinformatics approaches to further define the mechanism of sulfate respiration by SRB and how this is impacted by environmental stress. This is important because sulfate respiration is ubiquitous and greatly impacts industrial and natural environments in Canada and elsewhere, yet is still poorly understood.

"Cellular automata and iterated systems are discrete dynamical systems that can be used to model many processes of interest in a variety of sciences.  They have been used, for example, to construct models of crystal growth, chemical reactions, spiral galaxies, social interactions, and vehicle traffic.  They are used in applications in computer chip design, cryptography, and as pseudo-random number generators.  The program set forth in this proposal involves both analytic studies of the mathematical properties of cellular automata and iterated systems and their application in construction of simple models that illustrate general principles of complex systems.  For example, recent work has considered the trade-off between stability and flexibility and shown that in environments where random fluctuations occur that preferentially select for one or another of two stable types, an unstable type (that is, one which through self-monitoring and adaptive control remains ""balanced"" between distinct behavioral responses) can come to dominate, even if it pays a cost in terms of increased mortality.  Another study proposed for continued work will consider the trade-off between quickness of response and accuracy in perception of threat situations: a quick response increases the likelihood of escaping danger, but also increases the likelihood of missing opportunity that might be perceived with more careful consideration.  Simple models of cases like these are important for research on complex adaptive systems since the complexity of real world systems often masks general underlying principles.

"In the future-generation cellular mobile radio systems with base stations equipped by multi-antenna transceivers, the use of adaptive beamformers is a key technology for spatially selective signal reception (uplink beamforming) and transmission (downlink beamforming) which has recently emerged and is now an area of intensive research. Using the spatial selectivity of antenna arrays, the receive and transmit beamforming facilitates an increase in system capacity and a decrease in the transmission power. Thus, multi-antenna technology demonstrates the potential to support high data rates while at the same time using less power. However, these can be achieved by possibly increasing the computational complexity of the transmitter and receiver. As a result, multi-antenna technology poses optimization challenges that conventional design techniques cannot resolve directly. Our research within this project aims at resolving such challenges. In designing adaptive beamformers, the robustness issues have to be addressed. Indeed, the conventional adaptive beamforming techniques are developed for idealized signal and channel models. However, various imperfections, which occur in practice, can have deleterious effects on system performance. The main objective of this project is to capture the essential aspects of robust multi-antenna system design. Achieving this objective is expected to contribute, specifically, to defining beyond 3rd generation (B3G) wireless systems by taking into account the robustness issues.

"The main theoretical foundation for my proposal stems from the model proposed by Hugdahl (2000) according to which the observed perceptual asymmetry in any relevant task reflects a combination of a bottom-up component and a top-down component. Perceptual asymmetries are observed whenever presentation of specific stimuli produces a performance advantage for one side of the body over the other. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on visual and auditory stimuli producing, respectively, an advantage for stimuli presented in the left or right visual field, and an advantage for sounds presented to the left or right ear. In this context, the bottom-up aspect reflects stimulus content (typically verbal or non-verbal) and cerebral organization, whereas the top-down aspect refers to attentional effects (i.e. the ability to direct visual or auditory attention to a specific location). However, I propose that other factors should be included in the top-down component, whereas specific factors involved in the bottom-up component remain underspecified in the model. From this perspective, I propose to pursue three lines of inquiries meeting the short-term objective of characterizing top-down and bottom-up processes in perceptual asymmetries. In one line of research, visual and auditory tasks measuring perceptual asymmetries will be examined from the perspective that they have a significant memory component. A second line of research, will build on the hypothesis that sarcastic speech tends to be slower, of lower pitch, and louder than sincere speech. The third line of research will investigate factors responsible for stimulus dominance in dichotic listening and examine ways to minimize the influence of these factors in the assessment of auditory asymmetries. The long-term goal of this research is to identify task components and cerebral mechanisms underlying perceptual asymmetries with the ultimate goal to provide valid and reliable measurement of perceptual asymmetries for use in the pre-surgery screening of patients with neurological impairments such as epilepsy and brain tumors. Thus, this research has important applications relevant to the measurement of functional cerebral specialization.","Bottom-up and top-down factors in visual and auditory asymmetries",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Cognitive science -- language"

"Cognitive wireless networks is an emerging research field. A cognitive network contains heterogeneous users with different needs and constraints, but sharing the same resources (space, time and frequency). These users often consist of the primary users, who have priority access to the resources, and the cognitive users, who usually have restricted access, subject to a constrained effect on the primary users' performance. These more constrained users, however, may use some cognition in their schemes to satisfy the constraints and achieve better performance. Cognitive networks have potentially wide applications, including cognitive ad hoc networks (infrastructure-less) and cognitive cellular networks (infrastructure-based). More generally, they can either be integrated into an existing, under-utilized network, or be operated as a new network application.



This exciting area of cognitive wireless networks poses new challenges above the traditional point-to-point communications and a step beyond homogeneous networks. The simple question of how different groups of users can coexist in an wireless network has no simple answers. Involved are the issues of how to mitigate the interference among these users, how to cooperate, how to use side information, all in order to understand fundamental limits and to process information efficiently. Furthermore, because cognitive networks are often distributed, solving these issues usually requires distributed algorithms. In tackling these challenges, I plan to leverage tools from statistical signal processing, information theory, convex optimization, and communication theory. My goal is to understand and contribute to the design of efficient, emerging wireless networks. I envision building a dynamic group and creating both fundamental information theoretic results and efficient, distributed communication signal processing algorithms.

     Imagine yourself sitting in a restaurant and by touching the surface of your table (display) you order your food and drink. While you are waiting for your order, by touching the same screen at your table, you can find out sports results of your favorite team or talk with a travel agent to book your hotel and flight for next month's business trip. Or maybe, you would like to watch an HD movie or send a 3D virtual birthday card.  You are living in a virtualized world where the ability to transform physical assets into logical ones, or to create associations of many-to-one and one-to-many is an every day reality.  

     The proposed ""Virtualized Network for Next Generation Internet"" program is all about that. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we will see a network paradigm shift - from a server-oriented network to service-oriented, from personal resources to shared resources, from an operator managed network to user managed, from partial availability to global access. This will require a completely new set of network functionalities. The network will become an open and transparent medium for forwarding application packets. The control of such a network will move at the edge of the network, towards end-users. 

     The proposed research program covers a 5-year term, aiming to: develop and demonstrate the capabilities of a virtualized network, conceptualize network agility for efficient use of bandwidth on demand, and empower end-users to control it. Practical benefits of developing such a network are as follows: a) Enabling services based on a private network created on-demand; b) Allocating dedicated bandwidth to access available shared network resources (e.g., processing, storage and memory), as needed; c) Using bandwidth efficiently (i.e., reduced network operational expenses); and d) Enabling practical applications in education, environment, health, genetics, biotechnology, entertainment, energy, manufacturing, space exploration, etc.

"Energy and environmental modeling can shed light on important technological and economic issues related to greenhouse gases abatement strategy in Canada. We have on one hand a Canadian optimization model representing detailed production, distribution and final consumption technologies of the complete energy and industrial Canadian system, that was developed a few years ago and that needs to be updated and upgraded. On the other hand, we have a powerful optimization shell and toolkit, namely TIMES, which is operated with user-friendly interfaces to produce useful results to decision-makers.

"I will investigate theoretical and practical aspects of a new type of logic I call ""infinitesimal logic"".



Like fuzzy logic, it uses a spectrum of truth values between completely true at one end and completely false at the other. But unlike fuzzy logic, the additional truth values are discrete and separated from each other, not unlike quantum mechanical energy levels. For example, the truth value just below standard truth can be considered as qualitatively less true - in fact, incomparably (even ""infinitely"") less true.



One theoretical use is in the semantics (meaning) of rule based systems with negative conditions - such as Prolog with negation-as-failure. On the practical side, the intermediate truth values can help users express preferences and priorities.



For example, suppose you want to fly to Ottawa and prefer an aisle seat. Infinitesimal logic allows you to formulate this so that there are three answers: an unqualified Yes, which means you can; a qualified Yes, which means you can get to Ottawa, but not in an aisle seat; and an unqualified No, which means you can't get to Ottawa.



You can therefore make clear the fact that having  an aisle seat is incomparably less important than getting to Ottawa; for instance, that you are not interested in aisle seats to Calgary.

Computational astrophysics enables the astronomer's dream of seeing stars and galaxies come to life and evolve before their eyes.  Young stars can have substantial amounts of gas in disks around them.  With computer simulations we have recently demonstrated that these disks spontaneously fragment under ideal conditions to create giant gas planets larger than Jupiter. Pairs of young stars can nearly collide and shred the disks into a string of brown dwarfs.  These disks and young planetary objects are slow to lose their heat through infrared radiation and so they should be puffed up, a property we now intend to include in our models.  We will also model entire clusters of young stars for a much more realistic and violent planet forming environment!     



A major success of recent simulations is the formation of convincing spiral galaxies on a computer.  The simulated galaxies form over billions of years, consuming gas and smaller galaxies in what is regarded as fairly quiet evolution.  As a result they contain thin disks of stars that formed over the age of the universe in a manner consistent with real stellar populations in the Milky Way.  Dramatic merger events can transform these quiet galaxies into the full range of galaxies types seen in the universe and also drive some of their gas and stars into voracious black holes at their centres.  To model these galaxies even better we are developing even more detailed prescriptions for the gas and how it cools, black holes, how stars form and how stars die in energetic supernova explosions.

"In 1847, Kirchhoff derived a formula for the effective conductance of an electrical network as a function of the conductances of each of its branch elements.  This formula is a quotient of two polynomials, in which the numerator and denominator encode information about the minimally connected subgraphs of the network.  The physical properties of electrical networks can thus be interepreted as quantitative statements about these minimally connected subgraphs, or spanning trees.  For example, if the conductance of some branch is increased then the effective conductance of the whole network does not decrease.  This is known as ``Rayleigh monotonicity''.  It translates into the statement that, for any two distinct branches, if one chooses a spanning tree at random then these branches are ``negatively correlated'' -- the presence of one of them in the tree makes the other one less likely.  An analogue of this phenomenon has been shown to hold for abstract combinatorial geometries much more general than electrical networks.



Recently, it has been conjectured that an even stronger negative correlation property might hold for networks.  Instead of choosing a spanning tree at random we choose a spanning forest (an acyclic but perhaps not connected subnetwork) instead. Negative correlation of distinct branches is conjectured to hold in this case as well. This implies the Rayleigh monotonicity property.  If true, this negative correlation property has the potential to explain numerical observations about networks that go back to the late 1960s.  This would constitute a fundamentally deeper understanding of the quantitative structural properties of networks in general.

"The current proposal seeks to continue our long term program of studies on how calcium and phosphate homeostasis are regulated in fish and aquatic leeches by the peptide hormone, stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1).



Objective I. The mitochondria-rich, chloride cells in trout gill have high levels of STC-1 receptors. We will explore the possibility that STC-1 is targeted to chloride cell mitochondria as part of the mechanism of action by which STC-1 inhibits gill calcium transport.  



Objective II. Early oocytes in trout ovary produce a variant form of STC-1 that appears to be targeted back to these oocytes in an autocrine or intracrine loop. We seek to identify the sub-cellular compartment targeted by the hormone and to purify the  variant form of STC-1 for chemical analysis and bioassay.



Objective #3. Leeches have STC-related proteins and receptors that regulate calcium uptake by the skin. We will study the regulation of this transport process by factors such as calcium. We will also determine if calcium uptake in leeches cyclical over time (weeks), as it is in fishes. We will also purify two different leech forms of STC, characterize then structurally and test them in biological studies.

"Landscape spatial and temporal heterogeneity shapes diversity patterns at the levels of local communities, populations, and metacommunities, i.e., regional sets of local communities linked by dispersal: (1) differences in site conditions and disturbance create a mosaic of local plant communities that vary in the dominant processes governing their species composition and diversity, (2) the spatial configuration of patches of similar habitat type as well as the nature of the intervening habitat types (matrix quality) affect dispersal and gene flow, with important effects on genetic diversity and population persistence, and (3) patch size and spatial isolation affect immigration and extinction rates, with consequences for the relationship between local and regional diversity.  These effects have rarely been tested in landscape-scale experiments, as large experimental areas are generally not available, experimental manipulation would be very costly and would need to run for many years to show the hypothesized long-term effects. An applied landscape connectivity project was established in 1989 to connect and maintain calcareous dry grasslands by improving abandoned sites (e.g., removal of woody species) and re-connecting sites through rotational sheep grazing. My lab and I will repeat the extensive baseline vegetation surveys (after 20 years) and combine them with simulation modeling, molecular genetics, spatial analysis and scaling of species diversity, to address three main questions: (1) does a change in site management lead to differences in the spatial community structure indicating a change in plant functional group composition and inter-specific interactions?, (2) does a change in habitat configuration and dispersal vectors lead to a change in gene flow patterns of plants (both pollen and seed dispersal)?, and (3) does a change in habitat configuration and dispersal vectors lead to a change in colonization rates in plants, with predictable effects on the relationship between local and regional species diversity? Understanding how the different processes shaping plant species diversity patterns interact will help to predict the effects of human landscape modification and improve the effectiveness of landscape-scale conservation management.

"Most real-time multimedia-based applications employ digital video and image processors that are built on computation of irrational transform coefficients (such as cosine, sine, or wavelet functions), which cannot be exactly implemented due to lack of finite binary representation. Hence, in implementing them, we invariably introduce heavy truncation errors; as the process continues, more errors are incurred, which eventually results in inefficient design, and degrades reconstruction quality. In the recent past, error-free scheme has been shown to be an effective way in eliminating such truncation errors, where the basis functions are exactly encoded with integers. This integer implementation is very simple, and enables building efficient VLSI architectures. 

     The research expands and refines the concept of ""error-free computation"" by first proposing an investigation in a novel multi-dimensional level that allows more implementation-friendly features (such as parallelism, pipelining, simple additions, etc.), resulting in low-area, low-power, and high-speed designs. Secondly, by taking advantage of these attributes, we aim to build efficient and performance-enhanced intellectual property cores such as: (a) transform units for JPEG, JPEG2000, and H.264 compliant encoders/decoders with high quality data reconstruction for real-time applications, (b) video compressor for biomedical imaging applications such as capsule endoscope and telemedicine, and (c) image compressor for information security applications such as digital watermarking. These architectures will be implemented on both field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and standard-cell platforms so that the performance improvements in hardware and application levels can be demonstrated. Finally, we aim to develop a novel ""generalized error-free encoding"" that will encode virtually any discrete transform coefficient error-freely so that other designers may benefit from this scheme. The results of this research will significantly enhance the efficiency and the accuracy of many video-related commercial applications, which can be transferred to Canadian industry, enhancing Canada's strong role in defining future video products.","New architectures for real-time video and bio-medical imaging applications","Information systems and technology",CANADA,CANADA,"Image processing"

"Vertebrates use their different muscles for specific movements, and that they select the muscles that are mechanically most appropriate for each task. Motor units are the functional contractile units within each muscle and there are good mechanical reasons to suggest that the different motor units should also be used in a mechanically appropriate manner. We have recently developed the techniques necessary to determine which types of motor unit are active within a muscle during movements and locomotion. These have enabled us to demonstrate, for the first time, that faster motor units can be preferentially used for faster contractions. This finding is a paradigm shift away from traditional explanations of recruitment patterns. However, the evidence suggests that there must be other factors that are important and necessary for determining the recruitment patterns within a muscle but these are poorly understood for locomotor situations.

        The effectiveness of a motor unit to contribute to the force and work output from a whole muscle depends on its intrinsic properties, its level of activation and its location and orientation within the muscle. The working hypothesis is that the motor units used for a contraction should have the appropriate location, orientation and contractile properties to meet the movement demands. The purpose of this research is to map out regional differences in the motor unit location and activity in the lower extremity muscles in man and to determine the extent to which motor unit recruitment is associated with the mechanical demands of different movements.

        This research will generate fundamental knowledge about motor recruitment in voluntary movement tasks. This has significant applications for computational and simulation models of muscle force that are critically affected by the contractile properties of the motor units that are selectively activated during a contraction. Furthermore, a 3D muscle fascicle imaging system will be developed as part of the research and will be an important step for future studies that quantify the 3D motions of muscle fascicles for entire muscles during different movements.

"Residual stress-based post-weld treatments, such as needle peening or ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT), are one way of improving the fatigue performance of new and existing welded structures. Typically these treatments involve impacting the weld ""toe"" in such a way as to cause plastic deformations, resulting in the formation of a thin compressive residual stress layer near the treated surface. This layer increases fatigue life by reducing crack propagation rates at smaller crack depths. 

To date, only a small number of studies have examined the application of post-weld treatments under load. The results of these studies have suggested that these treatments should be even more effective, in particular for civil engineering applications, if they are applied after the permanent self weight or ""dead load"" stresses are introduced. No attempt has been made to date, however, to measure the stress distributions in welds that have been treated under load. What's more, no design (S-N) curves exist that consider the greater fatigue life increase that may result from treatment after the dead load stresses have been introduced. Whether the treatment is intended to improve the performance of new civil structures or to extend the service life of existing ones, some way of reliably predicting this additional fatigue life increase should result in significant economic benefits for owners of civil infrastructure in Canada and abroad.

Based on the above discussion, the main objective of the project described herein will be to conduct the research- and synthesis-related work required to develop a set of design curves for welds that have been treated by peening or ultrasonic impact treatment under load. The proposed methodology will comprise a combination of laboratory fatigue tests on welded steel specimens, residual stress measurements, and analytical studies performed using a strain-based fracture mechanics approach. The work will be undertaken as part of a graduate level thesis project. Additional support for this research will be provided by the Canadian Institute of Steel Construction (CISC) - Steel Structures Education Foundation (SSEF).

"A significant percentage of the cost incurred by society due to the deterioration of existing civil infrastructure can be attributed to the fatigue and corrosion of steel bridges. In many parts of the world, the deterioration of steel bridges due to fatigue is accelerated by increasing traffic volumes and vehicle weights.

Post-weld treatment methods, aimed at improving fatigue performance, have been used for some time by other industries. These methods generally increase fatigue life either by modifying the weld profile and removing crack-like defects or by altering the residual stresses near the surface of the treated weld.

Although their beneficial effects are widely acknowledged, concerns exist about the reliability of post-weld treatment methods, in particular under in-service (variable amplitude) loading conditions. Recent research has examined and addressed a number of these concerns. Based on this work, the main objective of the research proposed herein is to perform a number of the important steps still needed to transform post-weld treatment in the field into a viable rehabilitation alternative for existing steel bridges.

Achievement of the main research objective will hinge on the development of analytical models that can reliably predict the benefit of post-weld treatment in the field under realistic, variable amplitude loading conditions. The development of such models will require a multi-faceted approach including laboratory measurements of the various possible treatment effects and fatigue tests simulating post-weld treatment in the field part way through the service life. The validated analytical models will be used to perform probabilistic assessment studies to determine the benefit of treatment for entire bridge structures.

It is expected that the achievement of the main research objective will lead to significant reductions in the life-cycle costs associated with steel bridges. In addition, through the proposed research, a number of M.Sc. and Ph.D. candidates will receive training in fields expected to be highly sought after in the coming years by the government and private agencies responsible for the maintenance of infrastructure in Canada.

"Understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors that determine the biodiversity and species composition of communities is one of the most important scientific challenges today, in part because it is a pre-requisite to predicting the consequences that human activities will have on ecosystems. It is also one of the most daunting challenges. Even though disturbances (e.g. fires, hurricanes, floods) are a normal part of many ecosystems, they have variable short and long term effects on community structure. Disturbance, defined as a discrete event removing individuals or biomass, can exclude species, lead to the inclusion of more species, alter relative abundances, and/or change the physical or biotic environment of a community.  In this study I look at the consequences of disturbance in streams (floods) in the light of its effect on coexistence with the guild of predatory invertebrates (stoneflies and caddisflies). Since trade-offs between competitive ability and response to disturbance can affect the number of coexisting competitors, the critical measurements are sensitivity to the disturbance and sensitivity to competition. I propose to use a 3-pronged approach to examining the role that disturbance in the form of flow variability plays in the coexistence of invertebrate predators in high gradient, coastal streams. I will determine (1) if (and how) species richness of invertebrate predators is related to disturbance regime, (2) the primary mechanisms by which disturbance affects species coexistence within the predator guild and (3) how and why disturbance varies among streams (geology, geomorphology, land use).","Disturbance, competition and the invertebrate predator guild of high gradient coastal streams","Inland waters",CANADA,CANADA,"Aquatic ecology and limnology"

"Hip or knee replacement surgeries are often required when the cartilage surfaces of the joint are worn down or damaged causing pain and a lack of joint mobility. The commonly used strategy to alleviate pain and restore joint function is to remove the affected joint and replace it with an artificial joint replacement. The synthetic materials used in these devices have obvious disadvantages and recent research has focused on the development of living cartilaginous tissue in vitro suitable for cartilage repair.



However, it has proven to be difficult to synthesize enough tissue and to develop functional, load bearing cartilage that will be able to survive after implantation. Different strategies have been investigated to enhance the properties of the engineered tissue and one such method involves the application of mechanical stimuli. Interestingly, while the effects of compressive and shearing forces have been widely studied, the influence of tension has received relatively little attention. This research proposal involves investigating tension as a potential stimulus to accelerate tissue growth and to induce structural changes towards that of native articular cartilage. The information gained through this research will add to our current understanding of the appropriate in vitro environment required to synthesize functional cartilaginous tissue and provide a new treatment option that is less traumatic than conventional total joint replacement surgery for those with diseased cartilage.



In the next five years, the proposed research program is expected to prepare 9 HQP for professional careers in biomedical engineering. HQPs working on these projects will gain fundamental knowledge in the area of tissue engineering, cell/tissue culture methodology, histological analyses, molecular biology techniques and mechanical stimulation/testing of connective tissues. Trained bioengineering professionals are presently in high demand in both North America and Europe.

"Our research group develops strategies and instrumentation for identifying and quantifying two classes of biological molecules: proteins and sugars. We are studying ways to quantify trace levels of proteins in biological fluids through a technique called peptide mapping, which can identify whether a protein has been changed as a result of disease. When this technique is used in conjunction with mass spectrometry (MS), which measures the masses of each peptide, and with fluorescence detection (LIF), which determines how much peptide is present, the parent protein can be identified and quantified by its daughter peptide masses. We use enzymes that are insoluble as a means of fragmenting the large protein into its constituent daughter peptides. Mapping of these peptides can be done by microscale separation techniques called capillary electrophoresis and liquid chromatography, which are coupled to MS and to LIF. Our proposal describes how we will immobilize a particular enzyme (e.g., trypsin, chymotrypsin, etc.) into a capillary-sized column (microreactor) and then use it to cut a purified protein into peptide fragments as the protein solution is flowed through the immobilized-enzyme micoreactor. Various strategies will be used to develop and optimize: a) the procedures for isolating proteins from a biological sample, b) the microreactor for cutting the proteins into peptide fragments, c) separating, identifying and quantifying (i.e., mapping) the peptide fragments as a means to determine the amounts of each protein in the biological sample. When proteins from healthy and diseased individuals are different, they may represent important biomarkers for that disease. The significance of discovering a biomarker is its potential for developing new therapies. If such proteins could be detected early, when their concentration is still very low, treatment would be more effective.","Microscale analytical methods and sample processing tools for biomolecule characterization","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Separation methods"

"The Walker group will examine the interactions of polymer chains with surfaces. In this work, the adhesion strength, the surface induced conformations, and the electrical coupling will be evaluated. The polymer types include proteins, homopolymers, and block copolymers, and they will be interacted with surfaces with tailored techniques that apply mechanical and AC/DC electrical forces. These studies have been enabled by developments in single molecule adhesion mechanics and high resolution chemical imaging, made in the Walker labs.

    Broadly put, this work aims to understand the mechanisms and potentials of nanoscale self-assembly of macromolecules. Such understanding will enable the design of new polymer-based materials, with applications in designed surfaces for adhesives, photovoltaic devices, medical implants, sensors, chemical separations technologies, and memory storage devices.

These interfaces are often quite thin, and they exhibit extended polymers bridging two surfaces.  Useful properties like toughness, electrical and thermal conductivity and photosensitivity  are expected to depend on the extended shapes and conformations of the polymer molecules.

    Designing, observing, and optimizing such advanced conformations requires new measurement tools that are incisive on the nanoscale, and Walker's group will dedicate considerable effort for developing such tools.

"The aim of the NSERC Strategic Network for Bioplasmonic Systems (BiopSys) is to shorten the time needed for diagnosis and improve prognosis for cancers, such as lung cancer and leukemia, by incorporating plasmonics into diagnostic platforms. Plasmonics is an enabling technology based on an optical illumination technique. Bioplasmonics is technology based on this illumination for the sensitive detection of biological molecules, such as receptors on the surfaces of cells.

Our objective is to develop better alternatives to current fluorescence methods for cell-surface receptor detection. Plasmonics offers significant opportunities for achieving this. We will use tiny metal particles as light beacons for the receptors, and nanostructured metal surfaces as sensitive transmitters of molecular binding events. We will first develop platforms for examining model biochemical systems and then develop diagnostic tools for cancer. Our first practical goal is to determine the presence of the lung cancer at an earlier stage than is currently possible, to improve prognosis. Our second practical goal is to provide a point-of-care device for detecting leukemia, which will greatly shorten the time needed for diagnosis.

BiopSys will, for the first time in Canada, focus and integrate the full range of skills from the many different disciplines that are required to create these devices. The Network is poised to make revolutionary improvements in biomolecular interaction analysis, using the expertise of world-class physicists, chemists, biochemists, biomedical scientists, biologists, material scientists, and engineers based at university, industry and government research labs across the country. Our integration of molecular and optical technologies will enable the creation of both large-scale instruments that will permit faster screening and diagnosis and miniaturized point-of-care devices for patients. In addition, the network mechanism, with its emphasis on integration and cross-pollination, provides a significant training base; and our partnerships with industry will transition our creations to innovations of significant health and economic value to Canadians.

"The composition of the Earth's atmosphere has been and is being affected by human activity. Currently, the three major challenges for atmospheric science are stratospheric ozone depletion, climate change caused by greenhouse gases and tropospheric air pollution. In order to better understand these changes and their origins, measurements of the amounts of atmospheric gases, how they are distributed in the atmosphere and how they change with time are needed. One of the best ways to do this is to use infrared solar absorption spectroscopy.

This technique measures the concentrations of different gases in the atmosphere using their characteristic absorption patterns.



In order to make these infrared solar absorption measurements of the atmosphere, a precise solar tracker system is required. This computer-controlled mirror system tracks the motion of the Sun throughout the day and directs the sunlight into the spectrometer where the absorption spectrum can be measured. This proposal describes two new compact, reliable suntrackers that will be constructed for infrared Fourier transform spectrometers (FTSs) based at the University of Toronto. One FTS is installed permanently at the Toronto Atmospheric Observatory (TAO) and the other (Portable Infrared Research Interferometric Spectrometer for the Infrared or PARIS-IR) is a portable instrument for field measurements in remote locations such as the Canadian Arctic.  The PARIS-IR tracker will be used to make measurements to study ozone depletion and greenhouse gas concentrations during Arctic springtime and the TAO FTS tracker will provide improved measurement reliability, thus allowing a more complete time-series to be obtained for studies of mid-latitude ozone chemistry and urban air pollution.

Despite such rapid gains, productivity and quality remain serious concerns. While industry embraces attempts at managing quality, a prominent researcher argues: ""The concept of quality assurance and quality management systems is failing industry, government, academia and consumers.

This idea has been hampered by the lack of infrastructural support, and the lack of scientific knowledge about the consequences of the detailed approaches needed to make unanticipated reuse a practical reality. This research program is focused on developing that infrastructural support while evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of its use.  The results of this research program will lead to unanticipated reuse that is better understood, better supported, and therefore less risky in industrial practice.","Unanticipated reuse","Information systems and technology",CANADA,CANADA,"Software engineering"
"Gas hydrate blockage is a serious safety and security problem for all Canadians. Gas hydrates are made of

ice-like lattices that enclose gases (such as methane or propane) when temperature and pressure conditions are

favorable for formation. Dangers arise when these 'fire ices' form in drilling or transportation pipes used by the

gas and oil industry. When gas hydrate growth cannot be controlled, there can be disasters such as explosions,

which can cause loss of life, and also the interruption of gas supplies to consumers. As well, there can be

substantial environmental damage. Many such accidents are avoided, thanks to the use of chemical inhibitors.

Currently, the most popular chemical hydrate inhibitors are the alcohols, methanol and ethylene glycol. They

are required in very high volumes and therefore are costly to industry and to customers. In addition, these toxic

alcohols have themselves the potential to be environmentally damaging. Thus in some sectors, restrictions have

been placed on their use. What is urgently required are environmentally-friendly, 'green' gas hydrate inhibitors.

We have shown that antifreeze proteins, which enable certain organisms to survive freezing winters, can bind

to gas hydrates in addition to ice. This binding, or adsorption, stops the growth of both types of crystals. It is

now important to discover ""the best"" of the ice-associating proteins or cells that can be used as green inhibitors

and test them in larger scale experiments, which mimic their use in the field. This research requires the close

collaboration of expertise from biology, chemistry and engineering and resources from universities and a

government laboratory. It will also provide training for students so that they will have the opportunity for future

employment in target areas. Not only will this research bring enormous potential benefits to our industries,

including our collaborators Shell Canada Ltd. and Tolga Ltd., but to other sectors of our resource-based

economy. Above all, this research will contribute to environmental and personal safety and security in the

energy sector.

"Utilization of biogas is very attractive from a greenhouse gas standpoint since biogas is carbon neutral. Biogas can be used to fuel vehicles, thereby providing a renewable transportation fuel. Gas storage and fueling technology developed for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) fueled vehicles would be employed. Despite the environmental attractiveness of biogas, new challenges have arisen in the form of stringent engine exhaust emission standards (for both vehicles and stationary applications) scheduled for implementation in 2011. Low emission advanced engine technology requires precise control of air-fuel ratio, which in turn requires knowledge of fuel chemical composition. However, biogas composition varies substantially with time (and location, in the application where vehicles refill in different locations). Thus, there is a need for a gas

composition sensor that can characterize the biogas fuel for the engine control system. A gas composition sensor would also facilitate seamless multi-fuel capability, i.e. the ability to run on natural gas or gasoline if biogas is not available. Low cost sensors that provide unambiguous gaseous fuel composition information do not currently exist. The research proposed will develop a fiber-optic based gas composition sensing system. Utilizing a patent-pending multipoint sensing system we recently developed, gas sensors operating on very different principles will be incorporated into this system to form a unique gas composition sensing system. Absorption sensors measure the spectral absorption features of a gas species, while a unique hydrogen sensor uses palladium absorption of hydrogen to create a stress change that can be detected by a fiber Bragg grating. All of the sensors can be placed on the same fiber, allowing simultaneous concentration measurements of multiple species. Successful development of this gas composition sensor to characterize biogas composition unambiguously will be an enabling technology for biogas use in vehicles and will also enhance the operation of natural gas fueled vehicles.","Gas composition sensor for biogas fueled engines","Transport equipment",CANADA,CANADA,"Photon devices"
"    )	Diesel engines - a workhorse technology is fuel efficient and highly reliable -  provide essential motive power to Canada's people and industries. However, diesel engines emit significant quantities of gaseous oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) in their exhaust.  Increased concerns about the health effects of diesel exhaust emissions have resulted in stringent new heavy-duty diesel engine exhaust emission standards. A combination of engine combustion system improvements, fuel changes, and the use of add-on exhaust aftertreatment devices including particulate filters, oxidation catalysts and NOx absorbers will be required to meet the upcoming standards. While there are urgent research needs for all of these technologies, reducing engine out emissions through engine combustion system research will be in the long run the key to achieving very low emission levels.

    )	The primary source of combustion generated particulate emissions is the turbulent diffusion (mixing-controlled) combustion process.  Decades of fundamental research with diffusion flames has provided a basic understanding of the soot formation process but there is still much to be resolved.  Using an optically accessible combustion bomb and an optically accessible single- cylinder engine, the research proposed will investigate the mixing controlled combustion process with multiple jets, employing both gas jets and liquid sprays.  A high-speed digital camera will be used for the investigation in conjunction with various optical diagnostic techniques.    The focus of the research will be on understanding the interactions between adjacent jets/sprays, understanding the effect of multiple injections on mixing, and on employing non-conventional jet/spray patterns to enhance mixing.

"One of the greatest health risks from terrorist use of a radiological dispersal device (RDD) is from inhalation of radionuclide aerosol particulate after a high energy event (explosive, water or powder release). Additionally, a nuclear facility accident can release quantities of airborne radionuclides under certain accident conditions. Exposure to airborne radionuclides can lead to inhalation, and subsequent uptake of radionuclides into the body. Uptake leads to biological radiation dose and potential health risk. The risk from uptake can be reduced by administering appropriate treatment (such as decorporation therapy). Treatment assumes that (a) it is possible to detect the uptake rapidly, and (b) the radioisotope(s) can be identified, as therapy is element specific. As noted, the appropriate therapeutic treatment regime depends primarily on the rapid identification of the radioisotope involved, however first response personnel (EMS, Fire Fighters, Police, Nurses, etc) do not have the equipment and, more importantly, the expertise to perform rapid radionuclide assessment in the field. Rapid diagnosis is critical as treatment must begin within hours, not days, of exposure in order to ensure the best chance for recovery and risk mitigation. This radiological triage mask (RTM) invention involves development of a half-face mask device with alpha, beta and gamma detectors built into it that, utilizing appropriate hardware processing and software algorithms, can determine the presence of contamination, and also identify the radionuclides present in the orofacial area of a person suspected to have been exposed to airborne contamination. From this, an estimate of the quantity of inhaled material can be made. The mask concept was desirable as it is an ideal geometry for detecting facial contamination, and it is a geometry that is extremely familiar to first response personnel. This technology will be of great benefit to Canada and the World in response to radiological emergencies involving airborne threats.","A Radiation Triage Mas for Medical Countermeasures, Dosimetry and Risk Estimation","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)",CANADA,CANADA,"Radioactive materials"

This research program is focused on understanding how certain biochemical reactions are accelerated by the presence of metal ions. Millions of years of evolution have given metal-ion containing enzymes (metalloenzymes) unsurpassed abilities to perform chemical reactions under biological conditions. We are focused on understanding the subtleties of their mechanisms so that we can modify their reactivity or mimic it in non-biological systems. The analytical techniques we use in these studies are Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and Electron Nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy. These methods allow us to study in great detail the arrangement of molecules near catalytic metal species. 

Our research is focused in three areas:

(i) Metalloenzymes in non-aqueous solvents. In biological environments, enzymes react in water. However, it is possible to make them perform reactions in organic solvents. We are studying the mechanisms of metal-containing enzymes in a particular family of highly charged solvents known as ionic liquids. The goal of this work is to produce new biocatalytic systems for efficient molecular synthesis.

(ii) Transport of metal-based drugs by proteins. A number of anticancer drugs containing metal ions have been shown to be highly effective. We are studying how proteins found in blood transport these drugs into tumor cells. By understanding this process better it will be possible to develop new pharmaceuticals with greater efficacies than current treatments. 

(iii) Inorganic catalysts that mimic metalloenzymes. The arrangement of molecules surrounding metals ions in biological catalysts is responsible for their reactivity. We are studying materials that have similar chemical properties with the goal of producing new industrial catalysts that replicate the reactivity of enzymes

"An algorithm is a step-by-step solution to a problem, explicit enough to be translated into a computer program.  The time taken to solve a problem on a given computer depends upon the size of the problem and the efficiency of the algorithm.  For example, it takes longer to look for a word in a large dictionary than in a small one, but for a given size of dictionary it takes longer by searching through the dictionary from beginning to end than by using the more efficient algorithm anyone would use.



Combinatorial algorithms do things like combining and arranging objects in various ways and counting all the objects of a given type and size, either by constructing them all or by finding a formula for calculating the number of objects of that type as a function of its size.  An illustrative example: which is the faster algorithm for counting the number of ways of arranging n objects, constructing all the n!=1x2x...xn arrangements or calculating the product 1x2x...xn?  If the objects are strings of letters like 00, 01, 10, 11, it may be possible to arrange them in such an order that each one differs from the next one by a small number of letters (00,01,11,10).  Such an arrangement is called a Gray code.  The challenge: given a Gray code, design an algorithm that transforms each string into the next one in a small amount of time no matter how long the string is.



A graph consists of points and lines, with each line joining a pair of points.  Not every graph can be drawn on a piece of paper so that the lines don't cross each other (try drawing five points and joining every point to every other point with no lines crossing).  The challenge: design an algorithm that calculates the number of graphs with n points and m lines that can be drawn in this way in less time than it takes to construct all the graphs and test whether they can be drawn.","Design and analysis of efficient combinatorial algorithms","Mathematical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,Algorithms

"The aim of this grant application is to expand and accelerate the activities of the small musical acoustics laboratory at the University of British Columbia. This laboratory has access to many of the basic tools for vibro-acoustic measurements of musical instruments: data-acquisition computers, accelerometers, microphones, an acoustic velocity-probe, a high-speed camera, and two anechoic chambers. What it lacks is the sustained effort that comes with having a full-time student, and the financial means to disseminate our results at conferences and in journals.



We have already published our initial work on harps and violins. With a student, we can aim to do a through analysis of harps in their many forms: modern concert instruments, small folk harps, medieval and renaissance harps, etc. After this we will extend our work to other instruments, including the many Asian string instruments available to us at the University of British Columbia.



Through the activities of the laboratory we hope to further contacts with the handful of musical acoustics groups around the world, musicians, instrument-makers and ethnomusicologists. Improvements in testing techniques can have an impact on quality control issues surrounding manufacture and maintenance of instruments. The potential for training students is great, as one person can design, build from scratch, perform, analyze and write the simulation code for an experiment entirely by themselves. Graduates trained in this laboratory will have an impact on musical instrument manufacturers and on the way the subject is taught at the university level. They will also have a good grounding in acoustics that has widespread application, patent, start-up and employment opportunities in many areas, including environmental and health-care fields.

"This project targets the development of a near-net-shape fabrication process based on inkjet micropatterning of nanostructured composites. It addresses Canada's need for alternative low-cost competitive and green manufacturing methods. The technology will enable the inexpensive manufacturing of high performance sensors for structural health monitoring (SHM) of bridges, concrete structures, pipelines or other critical infrastructure. The current lack of affordable SHM of critical infrastructure has been linked to a loss in GDP of 1%. Inkjet micropatterning enables the fabrication of microdevices by drop-on-demand deposition of a wide variety of materials (polymers, solvents, functional composites containing nanowires and nanotubes, etc.) in the form of ""inks"" for non-contact patterning onto rigid, flexible, rough, smooth, and 3-D substrates and is capable of producing very large area devices at low-cost. The process is accurate, relatively high resolution (10-100ï¿½m), and high speed. It is also an example of green manufacturing since the process consumes very little material and produces little waste. New processes will be developed, where inkjet micropatterning is used in conjunction with an innovative hydrodynamic technique for controlled alignment of printed nanotubes and nanowires. Their alignment maximizes the intrinsic giant piezoresistive effect in carbon nanotubes and the giant piezoelectric effect in semiconductor nanowires. This technique will enable the manufacturing of novel strain sensing devices with sensitivities two orders of magnitude greater than conventional strain gauges. In addition, the higher zero-stress resistance of the printed structures results in lower power consumption and less influence from the resistance in the lead wires. The mechanical and chemical stability of carbon nanotubes and metal oxide nanowires will improve the long-term stability of the devices. In addition to SHM, the underlying fabrication technology will serve as a platform for exploring many other sensing applications.","Inkjet fabrication processes for large area nanostructured strain sensors","Manufacturing processes and products",CANADA,CANADA,Manufacturing

"The process of creating an extensive steam chamber in oil sand formations to melt the bitumen and produce the oil by gravity drainage as in SAGD (Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage) is seriously compromised by the presence of interbedded shale in oil sand. If the interbedded shale is damaged, then the injected steam can propagate effectively into the formation unhindered. To do this effectively it is imperative to understand the process thoroughly. In trying to model such a thermal oil recovery process, the correct description of the thermo-mechanical behavior of geomaterials under non-isothermal conditions is of prime importance. This project aims to develop a constitutive (stress-strain) model based on the physics established from a series of simple to advanced lab experimental testing with steam interaction. The model will be developed for the various mineralogical and microstructural characteristics of the material. 

   Once the constitutive model is determined, it will be implemented into STARS (a powerful commercial reservoir simulator) whereby various field strategies to break up interbedded shale can be analyzed within a high degree of confidence. This is aimed at improving both the oil production and the environmental performance of SAGD.

   This project will 1) increase the knowledge base of shale/oil sand behaviors at elevated temperature and under steaming conditions, 2) establish a geomechanical model that can address the interbedded shale field problem with greater realism, 3) predict various controlling behavoirs in the field better than any current model, 4) provide industry with an improved version of STARS, a reservoir simulator used world wide.

   Finally, the application of the geomechanical model created by this research will positively impact water usage in enhanced oil recovery by reducing the amount of water required for SAGD. Controlling the steaming process lessens the environmental footprint, reducing the cost of recovery and positively impacting the economic environment.

"There is a steady increase in the demand for replacement cardiovascular devices such as heart valves and vascular grafts as our population ages. Performance and durability of these devices are often limited by properties of the materials used. Although tissue engineering is promising, organization of components and functional properties of tissues generated are yet to be realized. Therefore there is a continuing search for better replacement materials. Traditional approaches include the use of synthetic biomaterials and treated animal tissues as in the case of mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves. In the case of arteries, only large diameter synthetic replacements are available. For coronary replacements, autografts from the patient have to be used. Many of the problems have been traced to mechanical mismatch between the tissue and the material used and lack of hemocompatability of the material. In our ongoing study of two biomaterials, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), a biocompatible hydrogel and bacterial cellulose (BC), a nano-biomaterial made by microbial fermentation in our laboratory, we have demonstrated that PVA with anisotropic mechanical properties similar to that of aortic tissue can be prepared. By the addition of the BC nanofibers, anisotropic PVA-BC nanocomposites with properties that can be tailored to mimic a broad range of cardiovascular tissues can be created. We propose to design anisotropic PVA and PVA-BC biomaterials to possess mechanical properties of the target cardiovascular tissue. Using these designed biomaterials as substrate, endothelial cells which impart hemocompatability in tissues can be attached to the substrate via surface reactions to provide adhesion sites of these cells. The resulting biomaterial-tissue hybrids of anisotropic PVA and PVA-BC would have good mechanical compatability with the neighboring tissue and at the sametime hemocompatabile due to confluent surface coverage with endothelial cells. These biomaterial-tissue hybrids would be suitable for use in a broad range of replacement cardiovascular devices.","Poly (vinyl alcohol) and its bacterial cellulose nanocomposites based tissue hybrid material","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical materials"

"Information systems (IS) analysis focuses on understanding a business domain and defining the requirements for an IS to support this domain. System design is the creation of a plan for an IS that will fulfill the requirements identified in the analysis. A proper process of analysis and design is critical to the success of information systems. Most techniques in use for systems analysis and design are based on practice, not theory. Consequently, it is difficult to evaluate and choose appropriate techniques. This project is part of a research program to develop theoretical foundations for systems analysis and design with the following long-term objectives:

1. Ground systems analysis and design in theoretical foundations,

2. Develop practical methods based on the theoretical foundations,

3. Develop computerized tools to support the theory-based methods.

   The research is based on a view of an information system as a representation of an application domain (a work-system). Accordingly, the purpose of analysis and design is to develop a faithful and usable representation of the domain. The definition of s a faithful representation requires a characterization of what needs to be represented. In philosophy, the area that deals with modeling the world is ontology. Hence, the research is based on ontological foundations.

    The specific objectives of the proposed research project are to develop:

1. A method to model work systems in terms of business processes and interacting roles, 

2. A method to identify IT-related control requirements in business processes,

3. A method to link the IT enterprise architecture to work systems models, 

4. An IS design that enables explicit representation of embedded business knowledge.

"My main research focus is on the development and evaluation of input devices for skilled computer use. The main research objective is to develop new and more effective input devices for human-computer interaction (HCI) in multi-parametric contexts - using audio and music as a testbed - and increase the knowledge on how humans interact with computers when carrying on complex tasks. 

This grant application aims at making possible to push forward my long-term research by focusing on the following main directions: 

1) The development of novel pressure and position sensors for musical as well as commercial applications by using conductive paper as their substrate. We will develop and evaluate novel prototypes of touch sensors using re-pulped paper to improve paper's electrical characteristics.

2) The evaluation of interfaces for musical expression, with the goal of better understanding the features of a musical interface that help (or hinder) performance of musical tasks in various contexts. This direction will make use of both qualitative and quantitative performance evaluation methods, including motion capture of expert performers playing novel input devices.

3) The development of force-feedback simulations of instrumental actions using general-purpose devices. We will pursue our research on the development of the DIMPLE framework to implement interaction models of musical actions (bowing and plucking strings, hitting  membranes), including models of textures and torques.

The potential impact of this research is major, since the techniques and technologies developed  can benefit a wide range of fields such as information technologies, entertainment industries (e.g games and music) as well as lead to various commercial applications.

"The environmental and toxicological impact of the downwind dispersion of contaminants released into the atmosphere, resulting from an accidental or deliberate release of a hazardous material into an urban environment, has become an increasingly important problem in recent years. The major challenge associated with this important problem involves obtaining a deeper understanding of the interaction of the dynamically evolving flow structures with the complex building geometry in an urban environment, as well as the coupling of the momentum, thermal energy and passive scalar transport processes. In contrast to conventional methods based on the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach, the proposed research aims at developing novel dynamic linear and nonlinear subgrid-scale (SGS) stress and scalar-flux models for high-performance large-eddy simulation (LES) of urban flow and dispersion. In order to achieve the goal of this research, this proposal is divided into two parts. Part 1 focuses on the fundamental aspects of the LES methodology for prediction of turbulent transport of active and passive scalars; and Part 2 focuses on application of the advanced SGS modelling approaches developed in Part 1 for improved LES of turbulent transport of hazardous substances in complex urban environments. In order to validate the novel LES approaches developed in this research, the obtained numerical results will be compared with experimental and direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. It is anticipated that the proposed research will provide a systematic comparative study of the existing and proposed SGS stress and scalar-flux models; advance the methodology of LES for high-performance computing of urban flow and dispersion; and lead to a deeper physical understanding of the subgrid-scale motions and their interactions with the coherent flow structures within and above the urban canopy. It is also anticipated that the proposed research will provide an opportunity to train highly qualified personnel in areas related to mechanical and environmental engineering, advanced scientific computing, and defence science and technology.","Novel subgrid-scale modelling for large-eddy simulation of turbulent flow and dispersion in urban environments",Engineering,CANADA,CANADA,"Modelling, simulation"
"Triangulation is to partition an object (a set of points or a simple polygon) into simplices (triangles) and is one

of the fundamental problems in Computational Geometry. In addition to its theoretical significance, it finds

applications in many areas such as Computer Graphics, Scientific Visualization, and Geological Information 

Systems. While the problem in 2D is well studied, its 3D counterpart (called `Tetrahedralization') is relatively unexplored. This is because the geometric structure of tetrahedralization is much more complicated.

For example, triangulation in 2D is always possible and the number of triangles in different triangulations of a

point set is the same. On contrast, not all the 3D non-convex polyhedra can be tetrahedralized without adding

Steiner points, and for different tetrahedralizations may have different number of tetrahedra.

In the related graph problems in 2D and 3D, the difference also exists.



In this proposal, I shall propose the following three main problems:

(1) To study tetrahedralizations with different constraints. For example, tetrahedralization with maximum number of tetrahedra and tetrahedralization with max-min inner angle of tetrahedra.

(2) To study related graph problems. For example, the Hamiltonian path in any tetrahedralization of a given point set, the connectivity of any two tetrahedralizations by diagonal flips, and the drawability of graphs as a constrained tetrahedralization.

(3) To study the sum of the square-root of integer problem, which is important

for proving a hard geometric problem to be in NP.



Investigating these problems will help us to further understand tetrhedralizations and probably to design algorithms for many applications.

"This research program is concerned with the design of scheduling mechanisms for multi-agent systems. Multi-agent systems scheduling can be seen as an abstraction of the decentralized scheduling problems arising in the context of Internet-based supply chain management, manufacturing, information processing and various service industries.  It is an important research field of great practical interests.

Our long term objective is to advance the design of scheduling mechanisms for multi-agent systems. In the period of the next five years, our main research activities include: (1) developing domain specific bidding languages which naturally and concisely represent scheduling objectives and constraints, (2) designing winner determination algorithms to deal with computational complexities of computing the output of a scheduling mechanism from agents' bids in auction-based scheduling, and (3) studying approximation scheduling mechanisms for the supply chain scheduling models.

Attempting to tackle scheduling problems in a strategic setting, we address algorithmic and strategic challenges at the interface of computer science, mechanism design, and scheduling theory. This research program will enrich the existing understanding of complexity issues in applying economic models to the domain of scheduling. It also advances scheduling research in terms of extending classic centralized models to decentralized models. In terms of practical significances, the outcomes could provide theoretical and technical foundations for designing automated scheduling systems for those inherently decentralized application domains. We anticipate this research to contribute to the development of scheduling components in large scale internet-based trading systems and strengthen the time-based competitive advantage of Canadian industries.

"Today's manufacturing companies compete in a global arena.  Design of products, such as automobiles, aircrafts, and consumer products, becomes crucially important for a company's global competitiveness.   With today's fast growing computing technology, complex simulation and  analysis are widely used for design studies.  However, it has been challenging to integrate such often expensive simulations into optimization, in order to search for the best product design.     

      In the past nine years, I have been developing new methodologies for expensive simulation-based design optimization.  Successes have been achieved in developing methodologies and tools for all major categories of optimization problems, including global optimization, multi-objective optimization, multidisciplinary design optimization, as well as probabilistic optimization problems.  All of these developed methodologies work very well for problems of low dimension.  The high dimensional, or large-scale, problems remain a major challenge.  Therefore, new methods and tools are needed.

      This work aims at tackling large-scale design problems. Approaches from statistics, computer science, and mathematics will be applied to approximate the large-scale problems.  Intelligent sampling, metamodeling, decomposition, and classic optimization methods will be integrated to support decision making and achieve the required optimization efficiency for large-scale design problems. 

     The developed methods will be applied to the design of new vehicles and hybrid vehicles using alternative energies.  When methods are applied in real product design, relevant tools will be developed in tandem with the applications. It is expected that the proposed research will conclude our past nine years of research and take a major step forward by addressing the large-scale design problems.  We anticipate that all of the developed and to-be-developed methods and tools would be ready for commercialization and for application in real product design at the end of this proposal period.

"The main issues preventing the commercialization of PEM fuel cell technology are performance, durability and cost. It is now well understood that the fuel cell performance, durability and cost are inextricably linked to the presence of liquid water throughout the fuel cell. Understanding of water transport in the PEM fuel cell, as well as mass transport, heat transport, charge transport (proton transport and electron transport) are essential to improve fuel cell performance, durability and simplify the fuel cell system and thus reduce the cost.



We propose to get a full spectrum of the transport phenomena in a PEM fuel cell through complete in-situ and ex-situ measurements of water, mass, charge and heat transport across the PEM fuel cell components and their interfaces. A plate-to-plate transport model will be developed and validated experimentally. The in-situ and ex-situ measurements will be carried out in macro-scale and micro-scale level. Understanding of the transport through the micro-structure of the components will be obtained. The transport model developed will be able to predict the fuel cell performance when operation condition and component materials are changed. 



The research results will be crucial to fuel cell industries to search cheaper and reliable component materials and simplify the fuel cell designs in order to have improved fuel cell performance, durability and reduced cost.

"Plants grow because cells (more specifically cells in the meristems) divide and these new cells then increase in size. Therefore, cell division is critically important to plant growth as to animal growth. Due to the pivotal biological role of cell division, there has been intensive research activities aimed at understanding genes that regulate the cell division cycle in plants. My research in this area aims to understand the molecular and biochemical mechanisms regulating cell division and related processes in plants. The discoveries from this research may be applicable to enhance plant growth (e.g. seed size) and increase biomass. 

      The cell cycle in plants as well as in animals is controlled by a class of enzymes called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), while CDKs can be regulated by CDK inhibitors. Previously, we discovered the first plant CDK inhibitors called ICKs from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (a model species for plant molecular biology studies). They provide an excellent tool to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating the plant cell cycle. In the previous work, we have analyzed the plant CDK inhibitors in terms of gene expression, protein-protein interactions, effects of transgenic expression on plant growth and development, cellular localization, and protein stability. Our work has contributed significantly to the understanding of the functions and regulation of this family of plant cell cycle regulators. Despite the progress, many important questions remain unanswered. Work proposed here will further study this family of plant cell cycle regulators in terms of protein phosphorylation, stability, functions in plants, interactions with other cell cycle regulators, and differences among different family members. In addition, we have initiated work on a novel protein modification pathway, UBC13-mediated ubiquitination. We will explore the role of this pathway in plant growth and development. The proposed research will maintain our exiting strong research on plant CDK inhibitors, and promise discoveries in a new research area.

"Sulphur removal is essential for processing fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil and coal. The currently available

sulphur removal and recovery technologies waste the hydrogen in hydrogen sulphide, though some of them

recover sulphur. These traditional technologies are not in favour with the economy and environment of Canada,

where there is an oversaturated sulphur market on one hand, and a tremendous hydrogen demand for

hydrotreating on the other. Hydrogen production from hydrocarbon fuels generates carbon dioxide, the

greenhouse gas. This project envisages a process based on a thermochemical reaction cycle which splits

hydrogen sulphide into hydrogen and elemental sulphur, with other materials such as sulphuric acid, iodine and

hydroiodic acid as working agents that are circulated in the cycle. The reactions include:

(1)H2S(g)+H2SO4(l)=SO2(g)+2H2O+S(s); (2)2H2O(l)+I2(l)+SO2(g)=H2SO4(l)+2HI(l); and (3)2HI=H2+I2.

The investigators will develop an integrate chemical engineering process that produces hydrogen from waste

hydrogen sulphide by conducting researches on these reactions and the related separations.

The implementation of such a new technology will be beneficial to Canada's economy and environment.

Particularly in western Canada, production of crude oil and natural gas is rapidly increasing to meet the energy

needs. Sourer resources have to become the targets of exploitation, meaning more hydrogen sulphide will need

to be treated for every unit of production. This technology will convert hydrogen sulphide into hydrogen. For

crude oil processing, this hydrogen can be recycled to hydrotreating, reducing the natural gas purchase or use

for hydrogen production. For sour natural gas processing, the hydrogen produced from sulphur removal could

either become the clean fuel or be pipelined into refining facilities for hydrotreating use. Environmentally, the

conversion of hydrogen sulphide into hydrogen will dramatically reduce carbon dioxide production due to the

less reliability of hydrogen on hydrocarbon fuels which this technology supposes to lead to.","A novel process for hydrogen production from thermochemical splitting of hydrogen sulphide","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)",CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical engineering"
"Carbon dioxide is the main component of greenhouse gases (GHG), of which the emission has climbed a historically-highest record and resulted in global warming and thus, more frequent extreme and damaging climate activities due to the massive exploitation and utilization of fossil fuels by human being. To ban this deleterious impact on our environment, one has been developing carbon dioxide sequestration technologies including geological storage, deep-sea storage and chemical conversion, in order to reduce and finally eliminate carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide reforming of methane and other light hydrocarbons, also known as dry reforming, converts carbon dioxide into synthesis gas from which a number of commodity chemicals and products are synthesized, forming one of the chemical utilization routes of carbon dioxide. However, the obstacle that prevents its commercialization is the lack of an industrially-satisfactory catalyst for dry reforming. To remove this obstacle, the strategy that Dr. Hui Wang at University of Saskatchewan uses is to first develop laboratory scale, highly active, ultra stable and well selective catalysts, to evaluate the acceptable catalyst under actual feedstock or simulated actual feedstock containing possible contaminants, to make industrial shaped catalyst, to study catalyst performance including mass transfer and heat transfer in larger scale, and to model the process for further scaling up. Thanks to the support from NSERC's Discovery grant, Dr. Wang and his students have successfully developed a composite catalyst that has undergone 2000 h life test and shown high activity and selectivity but no significant deactivation. Following this success, this project, also supported by NESERC's Dicovery grant, studies the catalyst performance in actual industrial feedstock, develops methods of industrial catalyst (pellet catalyst) preparation, evaluates the industrial catalyst, and models the process. In addition to the development of a commercial carbon dioxide conversion technology, the research work will provide opportunities of training high quality personnel in the areas of reaction engineering, catalyst development and GHG emission control for Canada.

"This project will investigate the changes of temporal coding of neurons in low frequency region of inferior colliculus (IC) and auditory cortex (AC) after damage is created in high frequency region in cochleae (the auditory part of inner ears). Previous studies have suggested that the impact of cochlear lesion is not confined to the auditory peripheral, but extends to central auditory system (CAS) as well. Consequently, plastic changes in the processing of frequency, intensity as well as temporal features of sound have been associated in CAS with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, a comprehensive understanding in temporal processing problem due to SNHL is not available. Specifically, it is not clear whether and how high-frequency SNHL, the most common pattern of SNHL for the elderly, will produce ""off-channel"" impact on the temporal processing in the low-frequency region as it has been demonstrated in intensity and frequency coding. This will be the focus of the proposed study. 

Temporal coding behaviours of IC and AC neurons will be measured in peristimulus time histogram (PSTH), in responses to amplitude modulation (AM) and gaps, as well as in duration tuning. The effect of cochlear lesion will be evaluated in two approaches: (1) by comparing the neuronal responses before and after a short exposure to a traumatizing tone of a high frequency beyond the frequency-response region of the neuron that is under study, (2) by comparing the neurons' temporal coding between normal subjects and those with the chronic cochlear lesion created in high-frequency region by using noise trauma or ototoxic drugs. We will also explore the use of implanted microelectrode to observe the dynamic development of plasticity after a permanent cochlear lesion. In addition, we will investigate the robustness of AM response in IC and AC, the persistence of this response to AM against background noise, the role of local inhibition in this persistence, and finally the potential impact of high-frequency cochlear lesion on this persistence.","Changes of temporal coding in inferior colliculus and auditory cortex of the guinea pig after cochlear lesion","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Life sciences research related to human health and disease"

"This program will investigate the kinetics and mechanism of the oxidation of several organic reagents which can be employed to (1) reduce dyestuffs, (2) form novel photochemical oscillators, and (3) prepare modified electrodes. Both illuminated and non-illuminated systems will be studied in order to devise a green process in which the reducing agent can be re-generated through  photoreduction. Research will be pursued from the following three directions: (1) Reaction dynamics and mechanism in homogeneous systems, (2) pattern formation in reaction-diffusion media, and (3) the construction of modified electrodes. For kinetic measurements, reactions will be followed by a Pt or an ion selective electrode, coupled with a reference electrode. Spectroscopic method will also be employed to follow and analyze the reaction. State-of-the-art instruments such as NMR, HPLC, and mass spectrometry will be employed to determine and quantify the reaction products, which will in turn provide guidance to our modeling. In addition to the long term impacts on the development of new green technology for dyeing industry and chemical analysis, the achievement of a new class of photo-controlled chemical oscillators will also greatly facilitate studies of perturbed nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics, a subject which has recently attracted increasing attention due to its potential applications in catalysis, biology, information processing, etc.

"Load data refers to the power consumption recorded by meters at certain time intervals at the delivery point level. Load data is one of the most critical data for operation, planning and maintenance power systems, and contains vital information for day-to-day conditions, for evaluating system reliability performance indices, for energy saving, and for system planning and expansion.  However, collecting all load data accurately in fine granularity is a challenging and costly task. For many years, British Columbia Transmission Corporation (BCTC) has been trying to address this issue of load data quality. Detecting corrupted or other invalid data is not an easy task because load data is naturally random due to uncertainty in the power consumption behaviors, outage events and dynamism of customers. The difficulty is compounded by the requirement of preserving the original patterns in the load data while removing invalid data and noises, instead of artificially making up the missed or corrupted data. 



At present, BCTC is using simple rules and heuristics (such as cut-off values based on context specific knowledge and experiences) to fill up missing data or replace corrupted data. Although this process works in some cases, it requires much manual intervention and lacks a statistical guarantee on the validity of this operation. Most heuristics are context specific and cannot be applied to other application domains with a similar problem. It will be of great value to have a systematic and principled solution to this problem. The terms ""systematic"" and ""principled"" mean that the solution is based on well studied methodologies, such as statistical theory and data mining techniques, and is based on general assumptions about data distributions.  For this purpose, the SFU's data mining group joins venture with BCTC to find a systematic and principled solution to cleaning the load data at BCTC. The knowledge and principles gained from such solutions should be also applicable to similar problems in other application domains as well.

"The goal of this proposal is to investigate and develop techniques for privacy preserving data publishing (PPDP), i.e., allowing publication of data for the benefit of research while preserving individual privacy.  The basic form of the problem we will study is as follows. A publisher wants to publish some person-specific data (e.g, a medical database) to some (possibly unknown) recipient for research purposes. The data contains private information that is essential to research. The recipient may be ""curious"" trying to re-identify the individual corresponding to a data record, possibly with the help of some prior knowledge. The recipient with this behavior is called ""adversary"". To prevent re-identification of data subjects, data must be anonymized so that data subjects cannot be associated with their records with a high probability. The key question is how to anonymize the data so that individual privacy is respected and the anonymized data remains practically useful to research. 



We will consider the following practical scenarios of the above problem: the adversary has certain background knowledge; data are dynamic and are continuously published over time; data may be unstructured; data may have multiple sensitive attributes. Our short term goal is developing anonymization techniques for such publication scenarios. The long term goal is developing privacy preservation solutions for emerging applications and technologies. These applications include electronic health records, wireless applications, location-based services, RFID, and user-centric publishing and social resource sharing enabled by Web 2.0.

"I propose to develop new methodologies and techniques to study the dynamics of evolution equations motivated by challenging mathematical modelling problems in biology and ecology: modelling the spread of infectious diseases, capturing oscillations and aperiodic behavior of genes and neurons  in gene regulatory and neural networks, investigating competition and coexistence of multiple species in an ecological environment.



Specifically, the research in mathematical modelling of infectious diseases aims to formulate  mathematical models to study how spatial dispersion (travel, immigration, etc.)  between patches (countries, cities) and heterogenous  mixing among groups will  affect the spatial spread of diseases, to  provide optimal control strategies and to predict possible outcomes. The research in gene regulatory and neural networks focuses on investigating dynamical behavior of genes or neurons from a network point of view. The behavior for each gene or neuron  is generally very simple, but when many genes or neurons form a network, very complex behavior including chaos  becomes possible. The objective of the research in ecological modelling is to explore how temporal delays (typical in the species' birth process and food conversion process), food chain reactions and spatial diffusion impact  competition, extinction and coexistence of multiple species.



This proposed research program will enrich theories of applied dynamical systems such as stability theory and bifurcation theory, open new directions for studying dynamics of non-smooth evolution equations and make a significant  contribution to the fields of mathematical epidemiology, mathematical ecology and applied dynamical systems.

"In the long term, the proposed research program aims to develop techniques for automatically interpreting and predicting attackers' progress, strategies, and intentions in defending computer networks against intrusions. In the short term, the research will be focused on scalable and efficient knowledge representations and algorithms, and on the design, implementation, and evaluation of practical systems for defending against multi-step intrusions in large-scale, distributed computer systems. More specifically, the proposed research program will identify root causes to the poor scalability of current knowledge representation and remove the limitation by proposing novel ways of representing knowledge about vulnerabilities and network connectivity. The research will devise heuristic algorithms for finding minimum-cost solutions to harden a network and evaluate the devised algorithms through extensive experiments. It will also propose security metrics for measuring risks, costs, resistance to attacks in an integrated framework and design efficient algorithms for optimizing network configurations based on the proposed metrics. Finally, it will study the distributed computation and analysis of attack graphs while taking into consideration potential local security policies that may prohibit the disclosure of vulnerability information to other parties. 

The proposed research will have positive impact on the theory and practice of defending against multi-step intrusions. First, the research will present interesting new concepts, such as compressed attack graphs, quantitative vulnerability analysis, and distributed vulnerability analysis and intrusion response. These concepts will provide new insights to existing problems and formulate new research problems and directions. Second, the research will lead to practical methods and systems that are applicable to a variety of distributed applications. These methods will enable members of a grid, a database federation, or a peer-to-peer application to jointly analyze global vulnerabilities, to reconfigure the network so as to maximize its resistance to potential intrusions, and to collaborate on the defense of ongoing intrusions in real time.

"The proposed research is concerned with finding relationships between a response variable and other predictor variables, some of which are either not directly observable or measured with error. Examples include personal exposure to air pollutants, long-term systolic blood pressure, social ability and wealth. It is known that statistical methods ignoring the measurement error result in biased and inconsistent estimates. The goal of the proposed research is to develop novel methods to accurately estimate relationships in the presence of measurement error, which do not rely on restrictive assumptions and are therefore applicable to a wide range of problems. The anticipated results will advance statistical theory and methodology, as well as provide better tools for real data analysis.

     Another research area is stochastic modeling and analysis of time when a random process first reaches a threshold. For example, the time when the population of an endangered species falls below a certain critical level, or the time when the number of infected individuals with a disease reaches a limit. The computation of such first passage time distributions is crucial in many scientific fields. The problem is particularly challenging, when the threshold varies with time. I propose to tackle this problem using my previously developed boundary crossing probability approach for Brownian motion process. Compared with other existing methods, this approach has demonstrated theoretical and practical advantages.

     Many modern research activities in science and engineering involve numerical optimization and integration. Moreover, complex data structures require highly sophisticated statistical modeling and inference procedures. The problems become very challenging when the dimension of unknown parameters is high. The goal of the research in this area is to develop efficient methods for random sample generation and statistical computation. Graphical methods will be developed to aid data visualization and exploration. Another goal is to develop user-friendly computer software packages to make these methods publicly available.

"The concept of 'Sustainable Development' has been around for decades and has become a part of our common usage in the media, government policy, corporate mission statements, and even in education curriculum.  However, the means of achieving the core values of Sustainable Development remains a global challenge.  Researchers and scientists advocating 'Sustainable Development' believe that one of the few ways to resolve this dilemma is through 'Sustainable Product Design and Innovation' in the manufacturing sector.



'Product Design and Innovation' is the key battleground that all companies must master to remain sustainable in today's highly competitive world market.  Traditional 'Product Design and Innovation' can be viewed as a set of activities that involves more than 'Engineering Design'.  A commonly accepted definition for the process includes everything from the initial product vision, to business and marketing analysis, technical engineering design activities, manufacturing process planning, and validation.  The objective of this research is to find out how traditional 'Product Design and Product Innovation' procedure can be reorganized to incorporate Sustainable Development principles i.e., to consider ""prevention"" as a starting point, and moves to integrated product development that achieves reduced impacts across the whole product life cycle.  Specifically, we intend to develop an integrated framework for concept generation and evaluation in the 'Sustainable Product Design and Innovation' process.  The proposed framework is based on the integration of several engineering design and analysis methodologies including: TRIZ (a Russian acronym stands for 'Theory of the Solution of Inventive Problems', Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Rule-Based Systems, and Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA).","Development of a design framework for sustainable product design and innovation","Manufacturing processes and products",CANADA,CANADA,"Design and manufacturing"

"Polynomials over finite fields have attracted considerable interest due to their wide applications in coding theory, combinatorics and cryptography.  One aspect of this research is the theoretical study of some arithmetic properties of polynomials and the theoretical study of their permutation behavior when applicable. Their connections with shift register sequences, combinatorial designs, and cryptanalysis are explored.



The nice behavior of  polynomials over finite fields is partially due to the fact that classes of polynomials over finite fields are nice classes of rings,   i.e., unique factorization semigroup rings. Another aspect of this research is the study of abstract semigroup rings, which is a meeting place for two essentially different branches of algebra: semigroup theory and ring theory. Of prime importance is the understanding of the interplay between semigroups and the associated semigroup rings. Another goal of this research is to advance this understanding, in particular, regarding certain arithmetic properties.  Moreover, the investigation of some classes of semigroups and their connections with combinatorics is also conducted.

"    )	        Since 1990s, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), about a hundred times stronger than steel at 1/6th the weight, have been discovered to hold great potential for countless technology innovations and applications, such as extremely lightweight and strong fabrics, chemical sensors, electrical sensors, fuel cells, and drug delivery. Business Communication Company estimates that global sales of CNTs will reach US$231.5 million in 2006. Unfortunately, CNTs' prompt and wide applications are hindered by insufficient understanding of their mechanical behaviour. Among many challenges, CNTs' stability analysis such as kink instability (abrupt changes of curvature due to compression) and post-buckling (large deformation due to compression) calls for a breakthrough. For example, inadequate understanding of CNTs' kink instability has been a major setback to the design of CNT based Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). Classic molecular dynamics is only applicable to stability analysis of systems with a small number of molecules and atoms. 

    )	      This research aims at addressing the aforementioned needs by advancing CNTs' stability analysis with continuum mechanics to enable the analysis of systems with a large number of molecules and atoms. Continuum models such as linear and nonlinear elastic beam and shell models will be applied to kink instability and post buckling analysis of CNTs so as to circumvent the limitations of molecular dynamics. Besides, this research will bridge the gap between principles in continuum mechanics of macro-structure and challenging nano-scale problems. The research findings are expected to provide satisfactory CNTs' stability analysis for proper design of CNTs' applications such as CNT-reinforced composites. The long-term goal of the program is to enhance fundamental understanding of CNTs' mechanical behaviour leading to revolutionary development and application of the material. It is expected that eventually the research findings will embody into the CNTs' design and usage by organizations like Boeing Canada Ltd and Composite Innovation Centre in Manitoba.

"This research project addresses a serious challenge in orthopaedic surgery: the prosthetic joint infections. Artificial joints have been extensively used to treat joint diseases such as osteoarthritis, with ~50,000 total hip and knee replacement procedures in Canada and over half a million in US annually. The overall infection rate could reach up to 2% for primary joint replacements, and up to 6% for knee revision procedures. Infection also accounts for at least 14% of the total implant failure. Patients having prosthetic joint infections would suffer from progressive joint pain and have significantly high levels of morbidity and mortality. Infection prevention through antibiotic prophylaxis is one approach but the necessary long term exposure can lead to antibiotic resistance. Seeking novel anti-infection solutions for implants has become one of the top priorities for orthopaedic surgery teams including the one at UBC.

The objective of this collaborative research project is to develop a new generation of joint implants with unique antimicrobial surfaces without employing classical antibiotics. The project is based on the latest breakthroughs at the Centre for Microbial Diseases and Immunity Research on screening and optimizing short broad spectrum cationic antimicrobial peptides. These peptides, once immobilized on implant surface, will protect these surfaces from colonization by microbes without incurring the severe problems of resistance encountered with the common antibiotics. The primary objective will be achieved through three key steps: (a) designing, screening and processing antimicrobial peptides; (b) immobilizing antimicrobial peptides onto implant surfaces by combining chemical principles with engineering techniques; (c) verifying antimicrobial effects and biocompatibility with in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal models.

The project will establish a strong collaboration among engineering, science and medicine and provide unique HQP training opportunities. The novel anti-infection surfaces developed will lead to a new solution not only to the infection in orthopaedics, but also to infection issues in other medical devices.

"Complex data sets have emerged from different scientific studies especially in genetics or bioinformatics. Data sets could be obtained from independent sources with different precision such as medical data from multiple medical centers. They also could be data sets with spatial and temporal structure such as the impact of global warming for Canada. They could also be measurements on the effect of a particular medical treatment on patients over a long period of time. 



Many traditional statistical methods are often not suitable to analyze data with very complex structures. Therefore, new methods are definitely needed to help scientists to understand the nature of stochastic processes and help them to make better predictions on the outcomes. I would like to propose several methods to handle data sets with specific underlying structures such as spatial or temporal structures. The long term goal is to create a unified and inter-disciplinary framework to analyzing complex data sets.



If the proposed methods are successful,  they might have significant applications on analyzing medical data to help researchers to understand complicated biological processes. They might also help scientists to better understand environmental data such as the impact of pollution and global warming.

"This proposal requires funding to upgrade three key components of a 6-year old Quadrupole time-of-flight (QStar) mass spectrometer. It is part of the Queen's University Mass spectrometry and Proteomics Services Unit (MSPSU) that supports the research programs in Chemistry, Medicine, Biochemistry, Biology and Chemical Engineering at Queen's.  This spectrometer is the only instrument at Queen's that can provide high resolution and Tandem mass spectral analyses of high molecular weight molecules including proteins, peptides, polymers, and supramolecular compounds.  The three key components of the spectrometer, Laser, multiple channel plate detector, and Turbo pumps are either not functional or near their lifetime, which poses a serious threat to the quality and capability of our MSPSU facility service and will certainly hamper the research efforts by several dozen research groups and more than 100 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at Queen's.  Therefore, the requested funding to upgrade the key components of the spectrometer is critical to maintain the quality and the competiveness of the graduate research and education in Chemistry and Proteomics at Queen's.



The QStar instrument supports diverse research programs at Queen's including drug discovery, green chemistry, development of new catalysts for acy and phosphoryl transfer reactions, new chiral and liquid crystal materials, the study of structure and functions of proteins, the investigation of new materials for optoelectronic devices, the examination of self-assembly of guanosines, artificial helices and nucleic acids, and the understanding of the regulatory mechanism and functions of enzymes in plants etc.

"An inert atmosphere dry box is a standard and indispensible equipment for research in inorganic and organometallic chemistry. The primary function of a dry box in our laboratory is for the storage/transferring of air and moisture sensitive compounds and the preparation of oxygen-free samples for the study of phosphorescent and photochromic switching properties, and the mechanistic study of C-H activation by transition metal complexes.



This proposal seeks funding to replace a 12-year old standard dry box that has not been able to sustain the oxygen-free atmosphere inside the box due to irreparable leakage, thus preventing us from performing key experiments that are vital to our on-going research program on luminescent and photochromic materials, and C-H activation chemistry.

"Triarylboron compounds are an important class of materials for optoelectronic devices and anion sensing applications due to their Lewis acidity/electron accepting ability and their fluorescence. Transition metal complexes, in contrast, are well known for their catalytic reactivity, their colors, and their ability to greatly enhance phosphorescence, a highly desired property for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and oxygen sensors. This proposal concerns the development of synthetic methods for hybrid compounds that contain both transition metal ions and triarylboron groups and the investigation of photophysical properties and potential applications of the new compounds.



Using appropriate ligands, the triarylboron and the metal center can work in synergy to enhance Lewis acidity/electron accepting ability of the boron center and to promote Metal-to-ligand charge transfer, color tuning, and phosphorescence, hence improving their performance as light emitting/charge transport materials in OLEDs, as sensors for anions such as fluorides and for molecular oxygen, and as catalysts for chemical bond activation.



The proposed research will focus on (1) syntheses of new triarylboron-containing ligands and their metal complexes, (2) fundamental understanding of the impact of a triarylboron center on the properties of the metal complex and vice versa and the impact of ligand's geometry on photophysical and electronic properties of the compounds, and (3) their possible utilization in OLEDs, anion and oxygen sensing, C-H bond activation and self-assembly of polymetallic systems.

"Recent development in spectrum opportunistic communication and cognitive radio brings significant interests in the design of robust and adaptive transmission technologies for operation in hostile electromagnetic environment with strong interference and fast channel variation. In addition, it is envisioned the emerging of global wireless information infrastructures will be characterized by the convergence of a variety of wireless platforms, existing simultaneously and supporting diverse multimedia services. These combined trends in wireless systems and networks bring fundamental challenges for the design of efficient adaptive communication technologies.

The primary goals of the proposed Discovery Grant program is to: (a) study the requirements on the transmission technologies that support spectrally efficient communication as well as the diverse multimedia data streams, (b) develop, analyze and validate the proposed adaptive communication technologies for the abovementioned purposes, (c) improve the efficiency of future wireless systems and networks through transmitter-receiver coordination and cross-layer design, and (d) system integration and performance evaluation of emerging wireless communication systems.

It is expected that the project will bring significant benefit to the Canadian society through high qualified personnel (HQP) training. Parts of the proposed research program will be supported by a recently approved CFI infrastructure grant awarded to the applicant (Leaders Opportunity Fund for Canada Research Chair) at the University of Western Ontario. The students working on this project will be involved in the design, analysis, simulation and prototyping of emerging communication systems using the CFI facilities. The experience and knowledge gained from this project by the students will prove beneficial to the Canada by enhancing the competitiveness of the research and industry communities.

"Architecture and parameters of conventional communications systems are designed statically based on a ""worst case"" of all expected communications scenarios. Without considering the dynamic nature of channel conditions and user requirements, the static design approach often leads to a very inefficient usage of the communications resources when the system operates at improved channel conditions or reduced data traffic. 

    An adaptive Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system, using precoded cyclic prefix (PCP) enabled control link, is being developed at Western to address the above mentioned challenges. The new technique is based on the concurrent transmission of communication data and the transmission system parameters using one OFDM signal, where each data-carrying OFDM symbol is preceded by one PCP representing the corresponding system adaptation information. The PCP-OFDM provides a flexible platform without the requirement of additional control or feedback channel. The principle and workability of the PCP-OFDM system have been verified by theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and a preliminary prototype supported by the Western Innovation Fund (WIF) and C4 Proof-of-Principle (POP) Fund. 

    Optimal architecture and algorithms for the digital signal processor (DSP) based PCP-OFDM transceiver will be designed and validated in the Idea to Innovation (I2I) project. Functionalities and standard compatibilities of the prototype will be enhanced by the fast OFDM adaptation block, environment sensing module and common interface. Performance of the prototype will be improved through running time and complexity reduction of the interference cancellation, PCP detection, and synchronization algorithms. Reliability of the prototype will be guaranteed by rigorous lab test under realistic communication environment. The parameters of the DSP prototype will be finalized to meet the requirements of our industry partners. The near-term commercialization plan is to license the technology to our industry partner's developing wireless applications. New applications based on this technology will also be demonstrated to other potential partners.

"The development of small, sensitive, durable, inexpensive, real-time sensors has received considerable attention from research and industrial communities in engineering. Piezoelectric sensors show great potential in various engineering applications, ranging from structural health monitoring to chemical and biological agent identification. Their high electromechanical coupling and quick response enable the effective conversion of mechanical measurements into electric signals with high sensitivity and high resolution. The applications of these piezoelectric sensors are widely spread into diverse areas. The detection mechanism is, however, unique and based primarily on measuring characteristic parameters of elastic waves traveling in materials, such as wave speed, amplitude, and attenuation to identify physical changes of these materials. These piezoelectric sensors are currently used, for example, in the nondestructive evaluation of structures to detect cracks, in the characterization of thin films to determine their thickness and modulus, and in chemical and biological surface-acoustic-wave devices to measure the mass absorbed at the surface to identify chemical and biological species. It is the objective of the current project to develop new integrated piezoelectric acoustic sensors for quantitative material evaluation. Piezoelectric fibres, which show much higher electromechanical coupling than traditional piezoelectric materials, will be used to design the integrated sensors. Both theoretical and experimental studies will be conducted. The theoretical study will be focused on the development of micromechanical models capable of describing the complicated electromechanical behaviour of the piezoelectric sensors under both static and dynamic loading conditions.  The experimental study will encompass the testing and application of the new sensors. Using such an integrated sensor system, a new technique will be developed to quantitatively evaluate the interior properties of materials. In the long term, the outcome of the current research could be used in the design of the next generation of acoustic sensors not only for engineering materials evaluation but also for chemical and biological species detection.

"    )	The use of randomization is essential in clinical trials because it masks the treatment identity, promotes the similarity of treatment groups and validates the use of statistics. However in desperate medical situations, the gold standard of balanced randomization favors the collective ethics (i.e., the benefits to the patients after the trial) but hinders the individual ethics (i.e., the paramount interests of the patients in the trial), and hence becomes ethically infeasible. This conflict is alleviated with the use of response adaptive randomization, the goal of which is to evaluate and utilize the accumulating information so as to improve the efficiency and ethics of the trial without undermining the validity and integrity of the clinical research. Most patients in the trial are expected to receive the potentially superior treatment without sacrifice to the collective ethics. This is a very important issue because in the 21st century, there is a greater demand of personal care in medical research. 

    )	There are still many unresolved issues and problems in this relatively young but fast-growing field, mostly on developing optimal randomization procedures and methods of statistical analysis. The specific aims of the proposal are to develop a new class of statistical designs and analysis methods that improve the existing ones, to assess the sensitivity of the designs, and to search for robust designs. The methodology is as follows.   

    )	(i) To develop the new class of designs, we extend our current achievements on the variance penalized criterion. The proposed approach is to combine the decision-theoretical design (using the Bayesian method and bandit models) and randomization (using the doubly adaptive biased coin design) and form new designs.

    )	(ii) The sensitivity analysis examines the stability of the available designs with respect to departures of model assumptions (such as model misspecification or non-normality) and measurement errors. The proposed method is to extend the standard ideas for independent data to dependent data from response adaptive designs. 

    )	Both the proposed designs and sensitivity analysis have not been addressed in the literature. We anticipate achieving potentially significant contributions and impact of opening up new directions of research.

"Spatial clustering is an important topic in knowledge discovery research. It is to partition similar data objects into the same group (called cluster) based on their distance, density and reachability in space. It can be used to find natural clusters, to identify hot spots, and to partition an area based on utility. Ignoring domain knowledge and users' requirements during the spatial clustering can lead to useless and distorted clustering results. However, most existing clustering methods do not consider them during the clustering process, which prevents users from precisely describing their goals and understanding the results. Although some methods consider constraints, they only consider sharply limited knowledge concerning the domain and the users.

The objective of this study is to propose new knowledge-driven clustering methods and clustering process. Domain knowledge will be mainly organized as ontologies. Users will be guided to select suitable clustering methods and datasets, customize distance functions on non-spatial attributes, and visualize the clustering results with explanation data. To achieve the objective, the first task is to build spatial clustering ontologies. Next, new clustering methods will be proposed, implemented and tested. Then, interactive software prototypes will be developed for guiding users to specifying their goals and supporting reasoning on the ontologies. Last, the framework will be applied on real applications in remote sensing and geospatial sensor network.

The proposed research will make original and significant contributions in spatial data mining research. New clustering methods and clustering process produced from the research will generate more meaningful and useful clustering results. The research will also have wide range of real world applications, including environment modeling (e.g., animal habitat monitoring, agriculture and forest management, air quality monitoring), city planning (e.g., intelligent transportation systems), remote sensing (e.g., photogrammetric calibration), and other applications (e.g., oil and gas pipeline management). The whole framework can also be extended to find clusters in a variety of semantic web environments in future.

"The dream of theoretical chemistry is highly accurate predictions of condensed-phase phenomena from first principles. Current theoretical methods either cannot consistently treat chemical reactions at a high level of accuracy, or are limited by system size or the time scale of the process. The conventional theoretical treatment of solid-state systems is the standard plane-wave periodic density-functional theory (DFT), but is limited by the scaling of computational cost and the level of accuracy. To achieve better scaling and accuracy, we rely heavily on DFT and improve the existing implementations of DFT. Each of the two ways of solving the DFT problem, i.e., the traditional orbital-based Kohn-Sham (KS) and the orbital-free (OF) schemes, has its own strengths and weaknesses. Recently, we have developed a new implementation of DFT, namely orbital-corrected OF-DFT (OO-DFT), which coalesces the advantages and avoids the drawbacks of OF-DFT and KS-DFT and allows systems within different chemical bonding environments to be studied at a much lower cost than the traditional self-consistent KS-DFT method. For the cubic-diamond Si and the face-centered-cubic Ag systems, OO-DFT accomplishes accuracy comparable to fully self-consistent KS-DFT with at most two non-self-consistent iterations. In this grant period, we will further develop OO-DFT, so that OO-DFT achieves linear scaling by employing currently available linear-scaling KS-DFT algorithms and becomes a powerful tool to treat large systems of thousands of atoms within different chemical bonding environments much more efficiently than other currently available linear-scaling DFT methods. We will implement OO-DFT into ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) so that a highly efficient and accurate OO-DFT-based AIMD method will be available for general usage by the entire theoretical/computational chemistry community. In the end, the theoretical techniques will be matured to offer the scientific community a reliable vehicle to provide qualitatively and quantitatively a microscopic understanding of basic mechanisms in complex systems, and to gain insights into aspects of nature that cannot be easily probed by experimental means.

"Advances in communication technologies are placing demands on the computer aided design tools to handle increased circuit complexity. Conventional approaches for RF and microwave circuit modeling are either very accurate but extremely time consuming, or fast but lack of accuracy. Without effective modeling techniques, design success often relies on either breadboard manufacture or prolonged in-lab tuning. Both are costly and have high possibility of failures. Therefore, efficient design tools are of vital importance to the high-tech industry.



The proposed research project focuses on the design of multiplexing networks, presumably the most complicated microwave passive circuit. The objective is to advance the state-of-the art in computer aided design (CAD) of multiplexing networks through effective application of artificial neural network. The problems encountered in the design of such complex circuits are divided into components. Combinations of different modeling techniques are proposed to tackle each task separately, enabling the development of design tools with both superior speed and accuracy comparable to precise yet time-consuming electromagnetic simulations.



First-pass success, shortened product design cycle and cost reduction rely on fast and effective RF/microwave models. The outcome from the project will contribute to advancement of space and wireless communication technology, advance the state-of-the-art in CAD technique, produce a solution that meets the industrial design and production needs, and thus enhance competitiveness and capability of Canadian high-tech telecommunications industry, including the industrial sponsor, in the global market.

"The objective of the proposed research program is to develop fast and accurate neural models for microwave circuit computer aided design. The emphasis will be on the application of neural network for microwave filter and multiplexer design and simulation. 



Conventional approaches for microwave filter/ multiplexer modeling are either electromagnetic (EM)-based, which is very accurate but computationally intensive, or empirical or equivalent-circuit-based, which is much faster but limited by the lack of accuracy. As a non-conventional modeling technique, neural networks are originally inspired by the studies of the ability of the human brain to learn from observations and to generalize by abstraction. In recent years, there have been increased interests in applying neural networks to microwave design problems. In this research program, neural modeling is applied to microwave filter and multiplexer design and simulation. Neural models are developed through collecting EM-based simulation data as training data. In the case of output multiplexer application, the frequency range and bandwidth are well defined, making channel filters ideal candidates for neural modeling. After the neural models are trained, modeling of single filters as well as multiplexers can be done hundred of times faster than conventional modeling technique while retaining comparable accuracy. 



Microwave filters/multiplexers are widely used in space and ground based communications systems. The proposed research program is expected to significantly enhance microwave filter/multiplexer simulation efficiency and product design capabilities due to the superior simulation speed and good accuracy of the developed neural models.

"Residual feed intake (RFI) is a liveweight and production corrected measurement of feed utilization. It has been recognized as a robust measurement of feed efficency in livestock. RFI is defined as the difference between the actual feed intake and that predicted on the basis of mean requirements for body weight maintenance and levels of production. Methods for evaluating RFI for meat producing animals during growth have been well studied in beef, swine and poultry, but there is no method available for evaluating RFI for female breeding stock. This is because the multifunctional energy requirements of breeding females, such as dairy cows, complicates the measure, but certainly does not diminish usefulness. Since feed reflects a large amount (40-50%) of the variable costs associated with milk production and conceptus' growth, genetic improvement of RFI can potentially be of great economic importance. Therefore, RFI research in the breeding female should be given a high priority. The proposed research will develop science based methods to evaluate RFI of breeding females accurately using the dairy cow as a model. I believe that genetic diferences of RFI exist in dairy cows and this can be used in the genetic improvement of feed utilization. Also high genetic correlation between RFIs obtained from a first lactation heifer (HRFI) and her life time RFI (CRFI) may exist and if so HRFI can be use to predict her CRFI. This proposed research is aimed to 1) develop an innovative science based methodology to evaluate RFI for dairy cow; 2) identify the genetic differences in RFI among individual cows for genetic improvement; and 3) investigate the possibility of using an animal's HRFI to predict her CRFI. Although the research project will use the dairy cow as a model, the theory and methodology will have broad applications across female breeding stock for other industries. This research program will present a major knowledge advancement in the field of agriculture sciences through better understanding feed utilizations. It will significantly benefit the dairy and other domestic animal industries of Canada and globally by improving feed utilization for milk and meat production.

"Ultrafine-(UF) and nano-grained materials have attracted much interest of researchers in the field of materials science and engineering due to their superior properties over the traditional counterparts. However, the microstructures in these materials are generally thermodynamically unstable, with a strong tendency to transform into normal polycrystals with coarser grain size, leading to the loss of their improved or novel  properties. Therefore, microstructural responses and evolution in UF/Nano-materials upon thermal and mechanical activations are of great interest for both practical and scientific reasons, as well documented in numerous publications. In recent years, many newly developed techniques for processing UF/Nano-materials introduce a large amount of UF/Nano growth-twins in these materials, such as Cu, Ni and austenite steels. These twins are usually very small with submicro- and nano-meter width, and they induce many special mechanical phenomena such as strong strengthening effect. However, these twins are found with low stability, i.e. they may recede, disappear and even convert to dislocation structures upon annealing and/or plastic deformation. Up to the present, no systematic investigations have been reported that detail these phenomena as well as related mechanisms. In fact, many aspects of these growth twins have still remained ambiguous. The present work will tackle these issues with the objective to understand the fundamental aspects of the above phenomena. Special attention will be paid to the dislocation - twin conversion mechanism.

    Organic materials are being used or explored for use in optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diode, liquid-crystal display and photovoltaic device that are mainly operated and best performed in the visible region (ca., 400-800 nm). On the other hand, organic compounds and polymers that can harvest and produce light in the near-infrared (NIR) region (ca., 800-2000 nm) are emerging as a new class of optoelectronic materials. This is mainly because of their unique properties and foreseeable applications in telecommunications (1300-1600 nm), thermal imaging (>1500 nm), biological imaging (800-1100 nm), and full-spectrum solar cells (400-800 nm and 800-2000 nm).

    Our overall objectives are to understand the underlying relationships between molecular structures, properties and device performance and to develop an emerging class of organic NIR materials for both fundamental studies and practical uses. The proposed research focuses on the synthesis and study of novel organic and polymeric materials with unique tunable electrochromic, photoluminescent, electroluminescent, thermochromic, piezochromic, photovoltaic, and chiroptical switching properties in the NIR spectral region (800-2000 nm). Changes in absorbing, fluorescent and chiroptical properties induced by external stimuli (e.g., light, heat, pressure or molecule) will be studied. These organic NIR materials will be explored to develop new proof-concept devices, such as NIR reflectors, NIR light-emitting diodes, and NIR photodetectors, molecular memory devices, optical switches, and bio/chemo-sensors. 

    The research program is designed to nurture an appreciation for modern science and technology, develop innovative training modules in emerging organic materials, and to attract students into the emerging field of organic/polymeric electronics and photonics. The students will be trained to gain knowledge in advanced synthetic chemistry, and have hands-on experience in material processing, device fabrication and testing.","Organic near-infrared functional materials: synthesis, property and potential applications","Materials sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Materials science and technology"
"The early years of the 21st century have witnessed a tremendous growth in the use of digital images as a means for representing and communicating information. Digital images are subject to a wide variety of distortions during acquisition, compression, transmission, processing, and reproduction. Eventually, most of these images will be consumed by human eyes. However, the most widely used objective image quality assessment (IQA) approaches have been found to be poorly correlated with perceived image quality.

    The objective of this project is to explore new theories and methodologies in the field of perceptual image processing, which aims to develop IQA methods that are consistent with visual perception and use them to benchmark and optimize a wide spectrum of image processing algorithms and systems. The last 5 years have seen a sudden acceleration in progress and interest in the area, and it is anticipated that the next 5-10 years will be the critical defining period of this immature but fast-evolving field. The short-term goals of this project include: 1) development of novel IQA methodologies and extension of their scope of application to pattern recognition tasks; 2) investigation of a new framework for perceptual image coding; and 3) exploitation of a new paradigm for perceptual image restoration. The long-term goals of this project are to establish a complete theoretical foundation and to provide a set of fundamental methodologies for perceptual image processing. Great effort will also be made to transfer the research outputs into commercially viable technologies.

     The PI's recent related work has been frequently and widely cited by both academic and industrial researchers and implemented in publicly available software packages. The success of the proposed research will not only make significant impact to the academic communities of signal/image/video processing and computer/human vision sciences, but also provide new technologies for many industrial, medical and military applications. In the process of achieving the scientific and technological objectives, we will train highly qualified personnel in information technology for Canada.

"Catalysts are widely used in the production of materials needed for making consumer goods (e.g. plastics, artificial fibres, gasoline, fertilizer, etc.).  Catalysts improve the utilization of raw materials by providing selective and low-energy routes for conversion to desired products. Hence, catalysts are a key player in green chemistry and improved sustainability of chemical and polymer production. Catalysts are also frequently used in the elimination of pollutants; the most well know application of this use is the automobile catalytic converter. The currently proposed research addresses both of the above aspects of catalysts.  The first area of the proposed research deals with studies on olefin polymerization catalysts.  The objective of these studies is to gain insight into the factors which govern the performance of polymer-supported metallocene catalysts for gas-phase ethylene polymerization.  We have developed various polymer-supported catalysts which are suitable for gas-phase polymerization, but the factors which determine the shape and structure (morphology) of the product particles are not well understood.  The proposed research will address this lack of understanding.  The morphology of the polymer particles is very important for the use of these catalysts in fluidized bed reactors; being able to control the morphology will allow the elimination of pelletization of the product (a very energy intensive step), as well as open the door for the production of specialized micron-sized, macro-porous polyethylene particles. The second area of the proposed research also deals with supported catalysts, but in this case the application of these catalysts is in the elimination of hydrocarbon pollutants by complete oxidation using diffusive catalytic reactors.  Diffusive catalytic reactors, rather than the conventional flow reactors, are widely used in the petroleum industry for space heating.  These devices are poorly understood, but they offer great potential for elimination of hydrocarbons at low concentration by catalytic combustion. However, improved catalysts with better resistance to sulfur and lower tendency for coking are required. The proposed research will explore new catalyst formulations for diffusive catalytic reactors.

"The Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) experiment is enabling the study of the highest energy proton-antiproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy near 2 TeV. The CDF collaboration consists of scientists from 15 countries, including a group of Canadian physicists affiliated with the Institute of Particle Physics (IPP). The IPP group joined CDF in 1991 for the Run I datataking period, which had as its highlight the discovery of the top quark. In Run II, performance of the Fermilab Tevatron collider and CDF apparatus have been high with peak luminosities in excess of 3E32/cm^2/s and data-taking efficiencies near 90%, enabling us to collect and process over 4/fb of data to date. The current Tevatron run is envisaged to end in 2010, with a projected integrated luminosity nearly twice that processed so far. The IPP-Canada group is currently leading or engaged in studies of b-jet production, b-hadron fragmentation, single-top-quark production, searches for exotic W' and Z' bosons, precision measurements of the W boson mass, the search for the low-mass Standard Model Higgs boson, and exclusive final states from photo-produced quarkonia or two-photon QED interactions. Results from topics in this broad range are both unique and complementary to what can be achieved using the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  With the current commissioning of the LHC, overall Canadian involvement in CDF has been ramping down as scientific resources have naturally been redirected to the large Canadian ATLAS effort. The present proposal is for operating support of groups at four Canadian institutions consisting of researchers that joined the Canadian CDF II effort more recently (in 2003 and 2008) and are therefore well positioned to complete the capitalization of NSERC's investment in the CDF II experiment and its physics in a manner that is complementary to the intensifying LHC effort. This will allow our graduate students and researchers to meet their service obligations to CDF up to the termination of data taking and to complete several legacy physics analyses at a time when some of the most exciting physics in the history of the Tevatron program will be explored.

"Climate change continues to be a global priority. Predictive models require reliable, long term, paleoclimate data to evaluate the accuracy of future predictions. The proposed research will provide paleoclimate data from Yukon Territory. This area is unique in Canada because of its glaciated surfaces of great antiquity and large unglaciated area that forms the eastern limit of Beringia. These glaciated surfaces were repeatedly affected by a glacier complex termed the northern Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The record of this ice sheet prior to 40 000 years is relatively poorly constrained. Across most of Canada, old glacial surfaces are covered in drift. In contrast, their exposure at the surface in Yukon allows us to use innovative dating techniques (such as Terrestrial Cosmogenic Nuclide exposure dating) to determine the age of the last ice cover. This helps us define periods of colder than present conditions, when glaciers covered much more of the landscape than during the last glacial period. Sediments relating to non-glacial periods located below and on top of these old glaciated surfaces can be examined for plant and insect fossils. By comparing these fossils to their present distribution, the paleoclimate can be estimated. Some of these non-glacial periods were warmer than present and can serve as a good analog for future global warming. In this instance, the past could be the key to the future. These non-glacial sediments can sometime be dated by the presence of volcanic ash beds, similar to what was produced by Mt. St. Helen's. Dating these glacial and non-glacial deposits is the most effective method of determining how climate change affect Yukon for the past 200,000 to 300,000 years.

"Water plays such an important role in our daily lives that it has justifiably received enormous scientific attention; however, the polar nature of the molecular interactions in water make it one of the most difficult substances to understand. These interactions have been found to give water a previously undefined surface property, the surface-thermal capacity. This property determines the amount of thermal energy transported by surface tension-driven convection. When water evaporates in the absence of forced or natural convection, and at low temperatures, where radiation is negligible, it had been thought that only thermal conduction transported thermal energy to the water-vapour interface where the phase change process takes place. But these recent studies have indicated that if the design of the evaporator is such that surface tension driven- convection is active, then the thermal energy transported to the interface by surface tension-driven convection can dominate that transported by thermal conduction! In some of our experiments, surface tension-driven convection transported up to 60% of the energy required to evaporate the liquid at the measured rate. Once this new mode of energy transport was understood, a new type of evaporator was designed, built and tested. It proved to be a more efficient evaporator than conventional evaporators, and the University of Toronto has applied for a patent on the evaporator, and established a company that has as its objective the exploitation of the patent. We propose four interrelated projects that have as their objective furthering our understanding of the surface-thermal capacity of water, and extending the range over which it can be applied.","Emergy transport by surface tension-driven convection","Energy efficiency",CANADA,CANADA,"Fluid mechanics"

"Increasingly, advances in science and technology depend on access to new (or rare) materials with new properties. Chemistry has a major role to play in the design and molecular construction of new materials ranging from new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry to new devices for the electronics industry. To build the sophisticated structures associated with many of these ""designer"" materials requires new and more powerful strategies. Chirality is one of the particularly difficult structural elements to control at the molecular level. For example, one of the chiral forms of thalidomide is a sedative but the other chiral form causes birth defects; the inability to control the chiral form synthesized meant that both forms were present in the marketed drug and led to the well known tragedy of the 50's and 60's.

 

The current proposal seeks to design, develop, and demonstrate some new and potentially powerful strategies that will allow the construction of new materials with absolute control over the chiral form at the molecular level. To implement such strategies will require the development of new chemical processes that facilitate the precise ""molecular surgery"" required to produce the desired materials. It is anticipated that this research will lead to useful technology for the construction of new (or rare) materials with important biological activities.

"The creation of a distributed system is a major engineering exercise, often costing many millions of dollars to design, and several times more to operate.   Indeed, the total cost in North America just to keep existing computing systems functioning exceeds $40 billion annually.  In spite of this expense, computer systems are typically insecure and unreliable.   The single major cause of this problem is that the complexity of these systems exceeds the abilities of all but the very best of human experts.  Even the installation of a networked home computer often requires significant systems knowledge.  The evidence suggests that this complexity is inherent.  Over time this problem will get worse not better, as we build larger systems and inter-connect those systems.  



The objective of our research is to address these hard problems of distributed-systems operation that currently require such deep knowledge to keep the system functioning correctly.  We plan to do so by having the systems self-manage.  In addition, we wish our systems to be based purely on commodity components, since we consider cost to be a major issue.  To then make the systems a commodity, we must limit ourselves to commodity hardware.  While computing systems today can use commodity hardware, the networks that interconnect them can be expensive to deploy and operate.  Thus we are adapting commodity wireless hardware to build cheap multi-hop wireless networks.



Our end-vision is that a user will simply plug computer equipment into the necessary power outlet and it will self-configure and self-manage as required, in the same manner that other major systems, such as telephones, self-configure.  The significance of this research is that, if realized, it will enable users to focus on their tasks, rather than on the operation of the system.

"Recent massive sharing and distribution of multimedia over networks creates a technological revolution to the entertainment and media industries and introduces the new concept of web-based social networking communities. However, it also poses new challenges to the efficient, scalable, reliable exchange of multimedia over networks. Proper management and protection of multimedia at such an unprecedented scale is beyond the capability of current technologies and demands new solutions to address critical challenges including content protection and intellectual property rights management; reliability and scalability; and media object management. Our long-term objective is to establish a multimedia management and security framework to provide effective management, secure and reliable sharing of digital media in large-scale social networks. This objective will be accomplished by achieving the following specific goals via investigating both fundamental technologies and system design methodologies: 1) developing trustworthy multimedia forensic technologies to protect multimedia intellectual property rights; 2) developing innovative content recognition methodologies to accurately identify and effectively manage digital media objects; 3) understanding the impact of human factors on multimedia social networks; 4) providing guidelines on multimedia system design to enhance media accessibility and security, and to support automated network-service monitoring; and 5) building an information management and content protection testbed. The proposed project focuses on the training of interdisciplinary, highly-qualified personnel with expertise in communications, media content security, and information management. The proposed research will significantly impact state-of-the-art platforms for information management and security in media-sharing networks. The success of the proposed research will definitely enhance Canada's competitiveness in the multimedia and entertainment industries by giving our Canadian industrial partners a valuable edge over their global competitors.","Information management and security in media-sharing social networks","Information and communication services",CANADA,CANADA,"Image processing"
"This proposal focuses on the applications of digital signal processing and machine learning to the brain computer interface (BCI) and face recognition areas.



A BCI allows a user to control a device such as a wheelchair or a computer by thinking of it only. The user's brain signals are automatically processed to detect the presence (if any) of the user's intention to control. Our research focuses on designing achieve a high-performance and reliable self-paced BCI (SBCI) system. An SBCI allows users to affect control at any time they wish and not only at specific times specified by the system (unlike the traditional BCI systems). Our main goals are to improve the performance of present SBCI's, obtain robust performance in the presence of artifacts, and increase the information transfer rate by adding more control options.



Face recognition is a biometric method that involves identifying a person in a stored database of faces, given an image of a face to be recognized. Much progress has been achieved in this field. However, building a practical automated face recognition system that deals with the scarcity of training data and works under varying imaging conditions (such as different face poses, different illumination conditions, different facial expressions, and occlusions) remains a very challenging problem. To address these problems, we plan to develop new and improved feature extraction methods and design superior classification algorithms that result in an automated face recognition system with a high performance.

"In general, a Material Testing System allows researchers to determine how much a force an individual bone can withstand before it is permanently damaged and fractured. But more specifically, the Material Testing System allows researchers to understand how specific components within the bone itself contribute to the overall strength of a bone. Bone is a dynamic tissue and primarily consists of minerals such as calcium as well proteins such as collagen. The interaction of minerals and proteins within the bone determines how strong a bone is - and this interaction is controlled by the complex interplay of hormones (i.e. estrogen, testosterone), foods and their components, and drugs. The Material Testing System will allow several researchers at the University of Toronto to continue to study how various food components and supplements alone or in combination may help to strengthen bone tissue. Examples of food components or supplements of interest include multi-vitamins, isoflavones in soy foods, lignans in flaxseed, and omega-3 fatty acids in fish and flaxseed oils.  Moreover, the potential benefit of combining food components with currently prescribed drugs used to protect bone strength can be studied. Examples of these drugs include selective estrogen receptor modulators and hormone replacement therapy.

"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to both Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis, disorders that cause the

intestines to become red and swollen, and dramatically lower the quality of life of affected individuals. Over 200, 000

Canadians have IBD, approximately the same number of individuals who suffer from type 1 diabetes. There is no cure

for IBD. IBD is associated with pain, vomiting and diarrhoea that impedes social as well as physical health. Because

IBD is a life-long disease requiring medications and often frequent surgeries, individuals with IBD are at an increased

risk of premature death. Moreover, IBD can lead to compromised bone health through production of mediators that

promote inflammation. Children who develop IBD are particularly at risk for delayed growth and bone development.

Compromised bone health may persist through adulthood putting them at risk of developing osteoporosis. Maintaining

a strong, healthy skeleton is a lifelong process.

Using a well-established mouse model that mimics IBD in humans, this study will determine if providing supplemental

vitamin D to mothers during pregnancy and lactation, and subsequently to offspring (pups) until adulthood prevents or

lessens the severity of intestinal inflammation. Moreover, this study will determine if skeletal weakening resulting from

inflamed intestine are also prevented or lessened with this intervention. A novel aspect of this study is the prevention

aspect, determining if early nutrition can protect against multiple chronic diseases such as IBD and bone

abnormalities. Positive findings from this study will provide an important base for prospective studies in humans.","Vitamin D for Prevention of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Associated Weakening of Bones","Not available",CANADA,CANADA,"Not available"

"Recent years have seen a decided effort to deploy hardware virtualization as a technology to help manage the scale and  complexity of modern computer systems.  Virtualization allows a single physical computer to be partitioned and made to appear as a collection of isolated virtual computers, each running an independent operating system and application stack.  AMD and Intel have released CPU extensions to aid virtualization, and all major OS vendors have announced virtualization support in the next releases of their systems.



This proposal is for a research program that explores the challenges and opportunities for systems software as virtualization is deployed in large-scale, enterprise environments.  The use of virtualization in facilities such as industrial datacenters and rent-a-server-style hosting providers dramatically changes many aspects of these systems, which must suddenly scale to support more virtual hosts on the same physical resources, and may be administered by considerably less experienced users due to lower entry costs.  Additionally, virtualization presents a narrow layer of interposition at which systems software may be deployed independent of overlying operating systems and applications.



As short term goals, I describe three virtualization projects that are already underway with masters students at UBC.  ""SecondSite"" is a disaster recovery system that maintains a live, remote copy of a running group of servers and allows this copy to take over operation of the system in the face of failure.  Second, my investigation of packet symmetry enforcement aims to impose limits on the ability of servers to transmit certain types of malicious traffic, protecting hosting facilities from inadvertently being the source of denial-of-service-attacks.  Finally, I consider the use of large caches of network-based memory, as a community resource to avoid the use of mechanical disks.

"Grinding is one of the most critical and costly manufacturing processes accounting for approximately 20% of the total machining expenditures in industrialized countries.  Profile creep-feed grinding is essential to a wide range of applications including gas, turbines, cardan shafts and driving elements such as gears.  Originally, this process was carried out with aluminum oxide (Al2O3); however, a relatively new alternative being used in Europe and Japan is Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN).  CBN is a man-made material that is more than twice as hard as aluminum oxide and has excellent thermal conductivity.  As a result, it does not require continuous dressing (to maintain wheel sharpness) and tends to cut at lower temperatures resulting in increased productivity and improved part quality.  Canadian companies, however, have been reluctant to adopt this technology partly due to a lack of regional expertise.  Furthermore, many Canadian aerospace companies find it difficult to compete simply because of the scarcity of skilled people.  To maintain global competitiveness in aerospace manufacturing, Canadian expertise in grinding theory and technology is required.



For these reasons, the long-term objective of this research program is to improve the quality and productivity of the grinding process by increasing our fundamental understanding of the grinding process and by developing innovative grinding technology.  In particular research on the micro-mechanics of grinding with CBN, management of the high temperatures associated with profile creep-feed grinding, and new more effective coolant delivery systems will be developed.  



This research will make significant contributions to grinding knowledge and technology, and will develop Canadian expertise and competitiveness in grinding through the training of highly qualified personnel in this key precision machining process.

"This project represents ""phase 2"" of a series of projects on low phytate pea.  ""Phase 1"" entitled ""Development of low phytate peas"" was successfully completed in 2006.  Phase 1 resulted in the discovery of two low phytate mutants in pea.  Phase 2 (described here) will characterize these mutants at the physiological, genetic, and molecular levels, determine their effects on bioavailability of phosphorus and micronutrients in an animal model, and set the stage for production of low phytate pea cultivars.  These cultivars are expected to have at least three major benefits which extend from pulse producers, to the pulse crop industry, to livestock producers and to environmental health.   Low phytate-phosphorus pea cultivars are expected to have improved bioavailability of phosphorus and several important minerals including iron and zinc.  This should increase their value in both food and feed markets.  These cultivars will serve as an appropriate complement to the low phytate barley and corn cultivars which have recently been developed.  Secondly, when low phytate-phosphorus cultivars are fed to monogastric animals and humans, less phosphorus excretion and pollution will occur, since these cultivars contain inorganic phosphorus which is digested by these species.  Thirdly, low phytate-phosphorus pea cultivars will result in a saving in feed costs, since the requirement for supplemental inorganic phosphorus or phytase enzyme will be reduced or eliminated.

"The consumption and release of carbon through photosynthesis and respiration are major ecosystem functions. Together, these processes are called the carbon cycle. The terrestrial carbon cycle is a significant determinant of the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. A quantitative analysis of the carbon cycle is also an important means of clarifying how an ecosystem is functioning and how it is changing. Photosynthesis discriminates against the stable isotope of carbon, C13. In addition, the amount of C13 in the atmosphere is changing due to foosil fuel consumption. Because of these two facts, measurements of the carbon cycle in ecosystems combined with measurements of the isotope ratio of its components is capable of providing much information about ecosystem function, and will allow us to develop improved models of ecosystem processes in order to predict the future health of both natural and agricultural systems. This project will provide detailed information about carbon cycles in a forest and in an agricultural system based on recent advances in micrometeorological measurement techniques.","Isotope discrimination and Lagrangian analysis for process-based ecosystem modelling","Earth sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Boundary layer"

"Wetlands are estimated to cover 4-8% of the land surface of the Earth, which is 2-3 times more than lakes, reservoirs, rivers and other freshwater bodies. The world's wetland soils contain the greatest quantities of carbon, a large proportion of which is in Canadian wetlands (including peatlands).   Disturbance by humans is a major environmental problem threatening Canada's wetland and carbon resources and the large economy dependant (directly and indirectly) upon wetlands (ie. food production, horticultural peat industry, water supplies, ecotourism activities, native communities).  Wetland disturbances are also closely linked to climate changes.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to identify which disturbances are within the natural range of variability and which are due to humans.  This research uses paleoecological methods (ie. analysis of pollen, plant macrofossils, testate amoebae, sediment characteristics, C sequestration, age dating) to reconstruct past wetland environments over long (Holocene time) and short (100 years) time frames to assess the nature of change and magnitude of disturbances.  This research contributes to resolving controversies about changes in wetlands, whether climate induced soil decomposition in wetlands will have positive feedback to climate change, or conversely, if carbon derived from plant biomass will exceed decomposition, thereby having negative feedback to climate change. Testate amoebae, a large component of wetland microbial communities, are being studied to develop testate amoebae as sensitive biomonitors of whole microbial communities to identify small-scale climate and carbon changes and human impacts.   Given that wetlands are a predominant part of the natural landscape in Canada, the information collected in this project will provide protocols for assessing negative environmental disturbances. This information will feed into development of better management plans, environmental and economic policies and regulations, and wetland restoration and rehabilitation efforts currently practiced at local, provincial/territorial, and national levels in Canada.    )

"A NSERC Strategic Project investigation is proposed that will directly examine the links between environmental aquatic floe (small particles), heavy metals, pathogens and antimicrobial resistance. Sedimentary floe is an unexplored compartment of the aquatic environment with enormous significance for water quality, as well as both ecosystem and public health relevance.

The proposed research will provide some of the first data that integrates joint assessment of floe as an environmental repository of (l)metals (2) pathogens and (3) antimicrobial resistance under characterized environmental physical and chemical conditions; capturing important synergies in these factors which influence their ecosystem and public health impacts. It will identify new diagnostic indicators that will promote strategic improvements and develpment of next generation approaches and tools relevant to economic, environmental and public health sectors for our non-academic partners: Environment Canada, Ontario and Municipal Public Health Units, Mount Sinai Hospital, Xstrata and Trojan Technologies. Significant benefit to Canada will ensue from this research, reflecting the significant and substantial potential to transform the diagnostic capabilities for profound environmental and health issues, ensuring our continuing leadership role in the stewardship of freshwater supplies, improved performance for key industry sectors and improving the health and quality of life for Canadians.

An integrated collaboration is proposed amongst 5 investigators, 8 associated HQP and environmental, industrial and public health sector non-academic partners. HQP will gain highly valuable transdisciplinary skills in environment and health techniques and will actively participate in workshops with end users enhancing their training and providing possible employment avenues. In addition the industrial, environmental and health regulatory agency partners will benefit from annual meeting/workshops enhancing knowledge transfer and ensuring timely and effective research outcomes for their use.

"Canada is a world leader in mining and mineral exploration and associated technologies to promote environmentally sustainable mining practises. However AMD remains a significant and growing Canadian water quality issue. Microorganisms are widespread across aquatic environmental systems where they affect  many important geochemical processes.  The proposed research will carry out one of the first comprehensive  monitoring programs evaluating microbial S geochemistry in situ. Integrated floc S geochemistry and microbial community will be investigated under environmentally characterized conditions over seasonal and annual scales. Field results will capture the synergistic interactions amongst these factors in a key and poorly studied aquatic compartment, suspended floc, providing a more realistic and necessary map of microbially driven S oxidation and acid generation in acidic mine waters.  Companion laboratory experiments will delineate the roles of poorly studied, microbially relevant and common mine environmental factors such as Fe(III) and NO3- as drivers for microbial floc S geochemistry.  The short term goals of the proposed research will specifically constrain the role of suspended floc as a reactive microbial compartment involved in acid generation, the magnitude of bacterially driven acid generation over seasonal and annual timescales, and evaluate the ecological diversity of Acidithiobacilli floc S geochemistry in situ in acid mine systems.  This research will generate (1) new fundamental understanding of key processes involved in AMD generation (2) new diagnostic indicators for more accurate surveillance and monitoring programs and (3) new strategies for mitigation and bioremediation improving the health and quality of life for Canadians.

Recent work by the applicant has demonstrated outdoor multi-vehicle collision avoidance flight tests, where three quadrotors performed autonomous take-off and landing , path planning, conflict resolution and trajectory execution, all in real-time.



This research will undertake to advance the state of the art in automating micro-aerial vehicle teams by expanding capabilities in the areas of perception, planning and coordination.  By combining vision and laser data from multiple vehicles, 3D maps of the surrounding environment will be developed in the absence of GPS for autonomous operation both indoors and outside, in forests and urban environments. Real-time 3D motion planning algorithms and improved trajectory tracking controller designs will then be created for precise vehicle motion through the mapped environment.  Finally, new algorithms that efficiently allocate sensing, computation and communication resources to the most pressing tasks required of the team will also be developed. Incorporating all three of these capabilities on a team of 1 kg quadrotors represents the core challenge of this research, and successful implementation will open up many new applications in remote sensing with aerial vehicles.

"Although they don't have hands, tadpoles can nevertheless have handedness. For instance, tadpoles of most species typically turn about twice as often to their left than their right side when startled. Even more curious, tadpoles of many species (but not all) prefer to view themselves in mirrors with their left eye rather than their right. With NSERC support I plan to survey such ""lateralized"" behaviors from tadpoles of as many families and genera of frogs as possible. My overall goal is to understand the evolution of lateralized behaviors in these organisms.

  There is circumstantial evidence that turning bias in tadpoles is linked to asymmetry in the size of certain cells in their hindbrains. In order to elucidate this behavioural-neural link, I will examine the size of those cells in species with strongly lateralized behaviors. I will then test the hypothesis that handedness in tadpoles correlates with both the evolutionary relationships of the frogs and asymmetries in their brains.

  There are some recent data suggesting that predation risk influenced tadpole turning bias. I thus plan to investigate this in several species by recording tadpoles' turning biases while caged predators, such as fish, are nearby.

  Lastly, I have suggested that tadpoles might interpret their own image in a mirror as another tadpole and respond to their images as if they were crowded by other tadpoles. With NSERC support, I wish to test the hypothesis that different species will grow at different rates when raised in aquaria with mirrored walls depending on their propensity to live in dense groups (i.e., to school).    

  Collectively this research should advance our understanding of the adaptive significance and evolution of lateralized behaviours in anurans and in other animals as well.

"In many real-time applications, timing requirements are as important as any other requirements. Consider a medical device controlled by software that is designed to deliver a specific dosage of radiation. If the device delivers the correct amount of radiation, but for too long a time period, it is dangerous. The length of time over which the patient is irradiated is just as important as the level of radiation emitted by the device. These systems are known as hard real-time systems in that they have definite (hard) timing deadlines.

     In a system such as mentioned above, there is an obvious safety concern. The software has to be developed so that it is provably safe. One step in the development of safety-critical software is the formulation of comprehensive requirements. Preferably, these requirements should be described with mathematical precision. A number of approaches have been developed to document timing requirements for hard real-time systems that are mathematically sound. However, these well-known approaches have significant deficiencies when they are used in real-world projects. For example, they do not cope adequately with tolerances.  The mathematical basis for some of these methods  can be shown to be invalid in the presence of tolerances.  Also, the intervals that result may be so large that the requirement becomes meaningless. 

     I was a key developer of the methodology used by Ontario Power Generation (OPG) to create safety-critical software for Ontario's nuclear plants. Together with colleagues and students, over the past four years we have formalized and extended the work I started at OPG, so that we can now describe typical timing requirements, and also predict the feasibility of their implementations - even when the requirements and implementations include tolerances. One particularly noteworthy result is that we have shown that longer sample intervals can achieve feasible implementations even when some shorter sample intervals cannot. My proposed research builds on this foundation. A primary goal is to produce software tools that help software professionals use these methods to build correct, precisely documented software applications that result in provably safe systems.

"Research on plant growth and development is benefitting tremendously from the adoption of model genetic systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana. These plants have a compact growth habit that permits in-laboratory Petri dish culture on agar-based nutrients.  Growth chambers that permit a controlled environment are critical for laboratories using model genetic systems such as Arabidopsis. The Wasteneys laboratory is at the forefront of discovering the mechanisms that control the shape of plants and specializes in microscopy-based analysis of cellular events and growth of living seedlings. The vast majority of our studies involve plate-based culture of Arabidopsis seedlings and we are now planning high throughput molecular-genetic screening programs that greatly increase the demand for culture chambers. Our specialization in the use of temperature-sensitive mutants requires a tightly controlled growth environment. Currently, this work is severely constrained because we do not own appropriate growth chambers fro plate culture and can only access one aging rental chamber located in a separate building. In order to carry out our planned research efficiently and with minimal disturbance to the controlled growth conditions we need to house our plant cultures in the lab, in close proximity to the microscopes that we use to measure growth and other developmental characteristics of our transgenic and or mutant seedlings. This acquisition of new equipment has been configured into the design of our new laboratory, which is currently under construction as part of a government stimulus package-supported renewal of the Biosciences building.

"The UBC Bioimaging Facility (BIF) is a microscopy resource facility with a strong training mandate.  We require a cryo-ultramicrotome to improve both biological sample preparation for microscopy and the training of students and faculty at UBC.  A cryo-ultramicrotome is specialized for cutting extremely thin slices of frozen biological material but is versatile in that it may also be used for conventionally prepared specimens. It is required for many types of sample preparation for both light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.  The BIF serves as both a service facility to which researchers bring their projects to have our technicians perform the work for them, and a resource facility where researchers come to be trained by our technicians to use the equipment to perform their own research.  BIF houses the latest light microscope and transmission electron microscope technology and is experiencing a bottleneck with respect to sample preparation. We currently have one ultramicrotome. A new cryo-ultramicrotome will allow us to expand our current service to more researchers and to allow us to train more students and faculty to perform their own research. As well, a new cryo-ultramicrotome will expand our current expertise with respect to the growing field of imaging frozen biological samples.  These samples are preserved in their native state without being subject to chemical fixatives and therefore the samples are artifact-free.  BIF currently houses some of the latest technology for imaging frozen samples and the BIF staff are international known for their expertise in this field.  A new cryo-ultramicrotome in the BIF will reinforce and enhance our expertise and augment research output at UBC.

"Plant growth, development, and performance are defined by the shape of their roots, stems, leaves and floral organs, which is controlled by the dynamic polymer network known as the microtubule cytoskeleton that coordinates cell division as well as directional cell expansion. The proposed research program capitalizes on recent discoveries by the Wasteneys lab to understand the mechanisms that control the shape of plants.



Microtubules are rod-like dynamic cytoskeletal polymers that interact with one another to self-organize into the cellular machinery that carries out work in eukaryotic cells. The first objective of this research program is to understand how microtubule self-organization works in plant cells. We intend to define how the proteins that associate with microtubules modify microtubule assembly activity and regulate encounters with other microtubules. Translating our live cell imaging data into computer simulations will allow us to develop a virtual model of this self-organization process. 



Our second objective will be to relate the organization of microtubule arrays to the mechanical properties of cell walls, which, in turn, control cell shape.  Microtubules situated near the cell periphery interact with large enzyme complexes in the plasma membrane that synthesize and secrete the most abundant biopolymer on planet Earth, cellulose. Cellulose forms highly crystalline structures known as microfibrils, which are the major load bearing structures in plant cell walls. We have now developed methods for measuring the mechanical properties of cellulose microfibrils in expanding plant cells and will define these properties in relation to the organization of microtubule arrays. Understanding these mechanisms is thus a critical goal to understanding how the shape of plant cells is determined. But, with cellulose increasingly seen as an important renewable resource for and emerging biofuels industry, our discoveries are also a biotechnological opportunity.

"This is an application to upgrade our existing 7.05 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) accessory.  This system was delivered in 2002 and has been used extensively, particularly for research involving operating fuel cells.  However, to continue performing frontier research in a rapidly developing field such as MRI, it is critical that both the software and hardware remain current.  Thus, we are requesting funds to upgrade our software and expand our imaging capabilities to nuclei other than hydrogen.  



The improved software will allow the investigation of key components of fuel cells, such as gradient diffusion layers, which is not possible with our existing system, and will also permit the imaging of rigid materials such as hard plastics or bones.  For example, the current software does not allow for ultrashort echo-time imaging which reduces problems associated with rapid H-1 spin-spin relaxation in these materials.  



We are currently restricted to H-1 MRI, yet many other NMR-active nuclei can in principle be used for imaging of materials.  For some materials, the lack of hydrogen atoms precludes H-1 MRI investigations.  Furthermore, imaging with other nuclei may provide valuable insights unavailable from H-1 MRI.  The practicality of imaging using nuclei such as B-11, C-13, Na-23, Al-27, P-31, V-51 has been demonstrated; however, developments and applications in this area of MRI research are at their infancy.  With improved imaging software and the necessary hardware, we plan to make significant contributions in the development and application of multinuclear MRI techniques for materials research.

"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to provide insights into important problems in chemistry, materials science and engineering.  We are particularly interested in gaining a better understanding of the relationship between the fundamental parameters that one measures in an NMR experiment and molecular structure.  We will take advantage of the fact that NMR studies of solid materials provide one with an opportunity to characterize the tensors that describe these parameters instead of their isotropic values.  Considerable effort will be devoted to NMR investigations of paramagnetic solids such as contrast agents used in MRI.  The information available from such studies as well as the limitations of modern techniques in probing these materials is not well understood.  We will use the National Ultrahigh-Field NMR Facility for Solids to explore the potential of high-field NMR spectroscopy, particularly in studying important non-integer spin quadrupolar nuclei that have not been well studied (e.g., As-75, Sb-121).  Our recent successful applications of NMR microscopy to study water distribution in operating polymer electrolyte fuel cells will be extended.  Immediate goals include: improving the spatial resolution of our 1H NMR images, improving water quantification, detecting water in the graphite-felt gas diffusion layer and extending our methodology to alcohol fuel cells.  Knowledge of water distribution in operating fuel cells is absolutely critical in developing more reliable polymer electrolyte fuel cell models.  Our NMR investigations of porous materials using thermally polarized and hyperpolarized Xe-129 NMR studies will continue.  In collaboration with Steve Kuznicki, a CRC in Molecular Sieve Nanomaterials, we are using Xe-129 NMR as well as Al-27, Si-29 and Ag-109 NMR to examine a number of potentially important silver-exchanged molecular sieves that have applications that include argon-oxygen gas separation.  Finally, we will be working independently and in collaboration with Paul Callaghan at Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand to develop applications of NMR in the Earth's magnetic field.","Magnetic resonance studies of molecular structure and dynamics","Physical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,Spectroscopy

In a financial market, an investor might seek to establish a dynamic strategy allowing him to optimize a certain function of the expected terminal wealth. With this in mind, he must base his decisions on a continuously updated flow of information without being able to exactly predict future market fluctuations.

"Semiconductors have revolutionized the lighting industry over the past 14 years. Until 1994, there was a large void in the visible spectrum. While bright red light emitting diodes (LED) have been around for a few decades, researchers were unable to achieve bright, reliable blue and green devices. The demonstration of long lifetime blue, green, and white gallium nitride LEDs by Nichia Chemical in 1994 opened up a multibillion dollar lighting industry. However, challenges still remain. Gallium is a relatively expensive element and it is not clear that GaN can meet future demand for low cost, high efficiency lighting. Ultraviolet emission is desirable for some applications, but is limited by the quality of aluminum gallium nitride. An alternative material, zinc oxide has the potential to solve several problems. Zinc is much more abundant than gallium, and oxygen is a much safer source than ammonia, the common GaN source. The bandgap of ZnO is further into the blue, possibly enabling ultraviolet operation. However, there are tremendous challenges to overcome. The current quality of zinc oxide is not sufficient for LEDs. There are severe problems with defect density, and p-doping, a necessary requirement for LEDs has not yet been demonstrated with suitable properties for LEDs. Most GaN LEDs are now made by a crystal growth technique called organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE). We will investigate the growth of ZnO by a modified OMVPE technique on sapphire substrate crystals produced by our industrial partner, Honeywell Electronic Materials of Victoria, BC. We will focus on improving the crystal quality and p-doping of ZnO grown by this technique on sapphire substrates and bring a variety of advanced characterization techniques to bear on the problem. Honeywell will work with us to understand the effect of sapphire substrate conditions on the resulting epitaxial films. This information will be used to improve their sapphire production process. The ultimate goal of the work is to demonstrate significant improvements to the electrical properties of ZnO grown on sapphire, thereby greatly enhancing the demand for sapphire substrates.","New techniques for large scale growth of ZnO on sapphire substrates","Materials sciences",CANADA,CANADA,Semiconductors
"This proposal aims to greatly expand the scope of the semiconductor growth research performed at Simon Fraser University. This work will build on an internationally recognized program in III-V crystal growth by the technique of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), with the recent addition of a capability to grow oxide materials such as ZnO and related materials. Three primary topics are discussed in this proposal.

     First, we will continue and extend our work on the growth of metastable III-V semiconductor alloys, such as GaAsSb. These materials are challenging to grow, but have been shown by our group to have very useful device properties resulting in some of the world's fastest transistor devices. However, many basic questions are still unanswered, for example, what are the roles of Sb and Bi on the electronic bandgap and the transport properties of III-Vs? We will extend this work into the dilute bismides with exotic materials, such as GaSbBi, which have potential applications in the emerging field of spintronics. 

     We propose to investigate the growth of narrow gap semiconductor nanowires in collaboration with colleagues at SFU and elsewhere. We will use our recent success in nanowire growth using a bismuth catalyst to enable the growth of III-V semiconductor nanowires made from materials, such as InAs, InSb, and GaSb, which have traditionally not been investigated in great detail. We will also focus on electrical doping of nanowires e.g. with carbon, as well as on the growth of narrow gap nanowires at predetermined positions using lithographic and other techniques.

     We also propose to expand our preliminary work on the growth of the wide bandgap semiconductor ZnO. This material has several promising applications, including visible light emitting diodes and lasers, gas sensors, and spintronic materials. We propose to focus on (1) understanding the electrical properties of this material by improving the crystal quality and by using novel characterization techniques, and (2) to investigate the growth of ferromagnetic materials on our epitaxial ZnO materials.

"Deposition onto surfaces of heat exchangers and other processing equipment is costly in terms of energy and operating efficiency.  If root causes of fouling can be established, design or operating changes can be made to mitigate the problem.  Mechanisms leading to deposition in hydrocarbon systems include autoxidation, polymerization, incompatibility of asphaltenes, coking reactions, iron sulphide formation etc.  The objectives of this research are to determine the underlying mechanisms of fouling for certain classes of complex fluids ( eg sour crude oils), and obtain a quantitative expression for the fouling rate which operators or designers can use to control fouling.  The research approach is to use batch reactors for reaction and precipitation studies, followed by fouling measurements in re-circulation heat transfer loops.  Effects of process variables and extensive characterization of fluids, precipitates and deposits helps to identify mechanisms.  Models are used to express results and make predictions of rate behaviour.  Tools include asphaltene flocculation titrations, solvent fractionation of fluids and deposits, and standard methods such as SEM, EDX, TGA and DRIFTS.  Topics include crude oil fouling; relation between asphaltene precipitation, coking and fouling in heavy oil systems; deposition of fine droplets from heavy oil vapour systems; and autoxidation fouling in naphthas and gas oils.  Novelty lies in the comprehensive research approach, the real fluids studied, and the unique facilities available for the research which permit realistic data under industrially important conditions.  Research is also underway supporting the concept of a future biomass refinery.  Similar approaches to those given above are being applied to study biomass pyrolysis oil behaviour during heating.  Our previous gasification research with coal and biomass is being extended to produce synthesis gas from bio-oil/wood char slurries.

"At the core of every ecological model, whether specified clearly or not, are assumptions about the encounter rates between individuals:  between predator and prey, host and parasite, plant and insect or infected and susceptible individuals.  Most models assume individuals are identical and interactions are independent.  This is clearly not the case; individuals are heterogeneous in almost every aspect: behaviour, physiology, size, age.  Despite this, simple models have been very successful: both as theoretical foundations and as applied tools.  Heterogeneities, however, are clearly important, and even subtle variations in individuals can lead to interesting and unexpected results.  This is especially true in disease control; vaccination models may predict control of the disease in the homogeneous case, but predict bistabilities and hysteresis in the more general case.  The objective of this research is to develop and test modelling approaches for specific case studies.    The proposed research follows three avenues: development of predictive models for several specific systems,  development and analysis of theoretical models for general systems and a study of analytical techniques applicable to disease transmission, spatial spread and predator-prey models.



The basic research suggested in this proposal is significant to the agriculture, aquaculture and forest industries as well as public health.  The funding requested will be used to develop models for specific agricultural and aquacultural systems.  Two seemingly unrelated examples include the spread of Emerald Ash Borer and the control of influenza; however, models and simulations are essential tools for prediction and control in all areas of environmental and health planning, and so the research will have a much wider impact than these two specific problems alone.

"Present-day computers store and process information electronically, using binary-valued components and logic gates, in a classical manner: each of the components in such a computer is in some definite logical state at each instant, and the evolution of these components from one state to the next can be described without any reference to quantum physics.  Quantum computers, on the other hand, are not restricted in this way.  Using quantum mechanics to their advantage, they may store and process information in ""superpositions"" of logical states, and can compute along many paths through these logical states simultaneously. 



My research focuses on theoretical aspects of quantum information and computation.  In particular, I am interested in understanding the mathematical properties of quantum information, and its potential uses in computation and cryptography.  This particular research project focuses on properties of quantum entanglement, interactions among multiple quantum computers that arise in computational and cryptographic settings, and complexity classes of computational problems that represent the power of quantum computers.



Quantum information processing has the potential to bring a transformative change to the way we build and use computers, communicate privately and implement cryptographic protocols, and study the nature of quantum physical systems.  This research project will lead to a better theoretical understanding of quantum information, to new computational methods that are useful in its study, and possibly to new ways that it can be used.

"Drinking water Taste and odour (T&O) is a serious problem in Canada, costing the water, food & beverage, tourist and aquaculture industries millions annually.  Most T&O is caused by the earthy-muddy compounds geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), produced by photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic (heterotrophic) microorganisms. Yet despite significant advances, we still cannot predict and manage most GSM and MIB events, because we cannot trace the source organisms, and do not understand why these compounds are produced. Two key questions will be addressed. First, 'WHICH ORGANISMS ARE KEY GSM AND MIB PRODUCERS IN DIFFERENT SOURCE-WATERS? We will use stable isotopes (13C/12C ratios) to trace heterotrophic and photoautotrophic producers and the factors fuelling their production. We propose to measure the 13C/12C ratios for GSM and MIB in field samples and cultures fed with: i) natural organic C- sources from terrestrial and aquatic environs; ii) 13C-labelled inorganic and organic compounds (using light and dark treatments to control photosynthesis). Second, 'WHY ARE THESE COMPOUNDS PRODUCED?' I propose that GSM and MIB are not 'waste products', but instead, are produced as chemical 'signals'. Previous studies indicate very low activity. But GSM and MIB exist in 2 molecular forms, and the synthetic (+) forms applied in these experiments are far less odorous than the natural (-) molecules. This is likely true for any other biological activity they have. We will test the hypotheses that: i) most biota produce the (-) enantiomers, which will be verified from culture material and field samples from a diversity of aquatic and terrestrial environments;  ii) there are major differences in the biological activity of these enantiomers as toxins, inhibitors, attractants or repellents, as assessed using  grazers and cultures of algae and bacteria. This work will make a significant contribution towards more proactive water treatment and management by testing potentially valuable indicators of source-water odour.

"In many notorious death investigations, the remains under investigation have decomposed to the point of partial or complete skeletonization. In such cases, elucidating the role of drugs or poisons in the events leading up to or associated with the death is extremely challenging. Conventional toxicological analyses, usually done on fluids such as blood or urine, or tissues such as liver, are often not possible. In these cases, analysis of skeletal tissues (mineralized bone and/or bone marrow) may be the only remaining option.  This research program will address this problem through characterization of drug concentrations in skeletal tissues in a forensic context.



Animal models will be used to investigate the concentration of drug in bone tissue under various conditions of drug administration, bone type and postmortem environmental conditions. Different drugs of forensic relevance will be examined to better understand the effect of variations in the chemical properties of the drugs on the observed concentration in bone tissue. The results of this research will provide insight into how long after exposure a given drug may be detected in bone tissue, the stability of drugs within postmortem skeletal tissues, bone drug concentration ranges expected following exposure to a given dose as well as the optimal bone type, and location within a particular bone, for skeletal drug analysis. This work serves as a basis for extension to studies with human tissues. Once this data has been collected, work may begin in its application to relevant cases within the justice system.

"A.  Physical Properties of Biodiesel Fuels at Operating Temperatures and Pressures

 

The Overall Objective is to determine the physical properties affecting the atomization characteristics of commercially available biodiesel fuels (and their blends with petro-diesel fuel) at operating temperatures and pressures so as to determine the cause of some of the current operating problems.  Specific Objectives are to measure the density, viscosity, surface tension and atomization characteristics of biodiesel fuels at temperatures and pressures up to 300C and 6MPa (1000 psi).  This involves monitoring of droplet sizes with a Malvern analyzer at temperatures and pressures up to normal cylinder pressures as a function of time through the injection cycle. This will involve measuring the time for different biodiesel fuel components to reach full evaporation (opacity factor) and correlating, against opacity factor and time after onset of injection, fuel type and composition, cylinder and atomization pressures,  temperature, & SMD. The properties of additives to modify the current deficiencies of biodiesel fuels will also be tested. 



B.  Fines Removal in Recirculating Aquacultural Facilities

The Ultimate Objective is to determine methods for removal of particles, particularly those less than 50 microns from recirculating aquacultural facilities that cause various diseases, including gill rot.  Specific Objectives include the determination of further physical and chemical properties of  particles that can be used to design for their removal.  This will be done by making a generalized model of aquacultural facilities that incorporates the real operating environment that affects particle size. Separation processes will be modeled so as to determine the best method of fines removal, based on the chemical and physical properties of the particles. Waste removal in low velocity flatfish tanks is particularly challenging.

This proposal is formulated around three central overarching scientific questions:



(i)      )	What is the magnitude of the climate feedback associated with enhanced methane production due to an increase in the active layer associated with an expansion of northern wetlands? 

(ii)     )	How does the terrestrial biosphere over Canada respond to a changing climate and over what timescales are these changes important?

(iii)     )	To what extent do large-scale reforestation/afforestation projects have the potential to mitigate climate change?

"The central nervous system (CNS) is not ""hard-wired""; rather, the CNS is ""plastic"" and can adapt to a variety of stimuli in order to meet the behavioural needs of an animal. For example, I have documented naturally occurring recovery of locomotion in partial spinal cord injured (SCI) animals. This recovery is associated with sprouting of remaining neuronal pathways (neuroanatomic plasticity). There is evidence to support the hypothesis that estrogen plays an important role in locomotor recovery and neuroanatomic plasticity following partial SCI. Estrogen receptors have been localized to nervous tissue of the spinal cord that contributes to locomotion. As well, I have recently demonstrated that estrogen is important in the control of autonomic dysfunction that develops following complete SCI. Recently, it has been shown that female mice recover greater locomotor ability compared to male mice following partial SCI and serum estrogen concentrations are determinants of locomotor recovery following partial bilateral SCI in female rats. The above evidence, taken together with the fact that sprouting of descending spinal tracts are correlated with locomotor recovery, suggest that estrogen contributes to locomotor recovery and neuroanatomic plasticity following partial SCI. These findings lead me to suggest the following general hypothesis: estrogen promotes naturally occurring locomotor recovery and neuroanatomic plasticity following partial SCI in adult rats. By manipulating serum estrogen concentrations in male and female rats, through pharmacologic estrogen receptor modulation, and by carefully evaluating locomotor recovery and neuroanatomic plasticity, the proposed research will investigate the importance of estrogen on locomotor recovery and neuroanatomic plasticity following partial SCI. This research will further our collective knowledge pertaining to neurohormonal interactions with behaviour, especially with respect to the locomotor system. Further, this research will result in training of highly qualified personnel in the areas animal behaviour and neural plasticity.","Hormones, plasticity, and locomotor recovery","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Motor systems and performance"

"While all electrical devices can be considered to be electromagnetic in nature, in that they have within and around them an electromagnetic field, there is an important class of devices which can only be understood properly by knowing how the electromagnetic fields behave. These are the ""electromagnetic devices"" referred to in the title of this proposal. They include a wide range of microwave and optical components used in telecommunication systems. Designers have long used computers to simulate the fields and thereby to predict the performance of their designs. However, many of the problems that engineers want to analyze push the limits of even today's computers. Devices are becoming more complex and accuracy requirements greater. For this reason, there continues to be research on better simulation methods. This proposal focusses on one technique, the finite element method, and specifically aims to advance the state of the art in three areas:

(1) Sharp Edges and Corners. The field near these varies rapidly and traditional finite element methods are not very effective. Better approximations will lead to more accurate answers in less computer time. Previous work has been in 2D; the proposal is to develop methods for 3D.

(2) Unbounded Problems. Many electromagnetic devices are open, i.e., their fields extend, in theory, to infinity. Techniques that allow the finite element method to handle unbounded problems are either inexpensive and inaccurate, or accurate but too expensive. The proposal is to develop an adjustable method, in which the expense is commensurate with the required accuracy.

(3) Photonic Crystal Devices. These are used in optics to manipulate light. They present a challenging electromagnetic problem because they consist of very many repeated shapes, e.g. rods. Traditional computational methods are expensive to apply. The combination of a recently developed finite-difference-like method and the finite element method offers the possibility of efficient analysis of photonic crystal devices even when the repeated shape is quite arbitrary.

"Observational cosmology is an attempt to understand the processes by which the rich and complex structure in the present-day universe formed and evolved.   While the generalities of structure formation are now well established, the details of galaxy evolution remain unclear, largely due to the complex physics which manifests on small scales. There are many unanswered questions, such as: how does the environment drive galaxy evolution? Do massive galaxies form in a single burst of star formation or is their growth extended over time?  Does a growing central black hole regulate the star formation within a galaxy, and if so, how? 



My approach to research in this area is multifaceted, combining a number of different yet complementary studies. I work on detailed studies of small numbers of galaxies, which can teach us about very specific physics driving their evolution; but I also undertake statistical studies of large samples, which provides information on global proerties of galaxies and the overall trends in galaxy evolution.  By studying galaxies which exist in isolation as well as those evolving in unique high density regions I can constrain the role of the environment in forming galaxies.  I also sample the entire electromagnetic spectrum, though with a strong focus on the relatively unexplored infrared regime. Such mulitwavelength data are crucial as observations at different wavelengths probe different physical processes which are relevant to galaxy evolution.  For example, the infrared allows us to study the current star formation in a galaxy, while optical light gives us information on (amongst other things) previous star formation.  Using these complementary techniques and the new generation of telescopes and detectors, I, along with my team of graduate students,  will shed light on the process of galaxy evolution.

"Our research group investigates two major issues: (1) how fish store, mobilize and use their energy reserves to support swimming, and (2) how their normal metabolic responses to exercise are modified by environmental pollutants, by a lack of oxygen (hypoxia), and by changes in water temperature. We are measuring how metabolic fuels are used to power muscles during swimming, and how the presence of toxic substances in aquatic environments (industrial pollutants, human pharmaceuticals), hypoxia, and higher water temperatures affect these normal processes.  Because the ability to swim is absolutely crucial for survival (predator-prey interactions) and successful reproduction in fish, a detailed understanding of the metabolic processes that allow locomotory muscles to function normally is essential.  The equipment requested in this application is a swim tunnel system (the equivalent of a treadmill for aquatic animals) which we will use to measure the metabolism of active fish under controlled conditions of water velocity, dissolved oxygen level, and water temperature. We will determine whether these environmental effects measurable inside fish cells - at the molecular level - are actually translated to changes in swimming performance - at the whole organism level. This equipment will allow for simulated long-distance migrations in the laboratory to understand, for example, how salmon locomotion is affected by recent changes in their aquatic environment (pollution, global warming). It will be used to train the next generation of biologists how to monitor normal metabolic processes in animals and to teach graduate students how to assess whether wildlife is disrupted by modern human activities.

"The goal of this work is to investigate how animals manage their energy reserves during prolonged exercise or cold exposure. Long-distance migrant birds have a remarkable ability to use fat reserves during locomotion and to survive in very cold environments. However, the mechanisms used by these amazing athletes to travel non-stop for thousands of kilometers have not been elucidated. In snow geese, we will measure rates of lipid transfer from adipose reserves to working muscles during free flight and suspect that they are more than 10 times higher than in the best mammalian athletes.  We will also determine how they protect uninsulated parts of their body from freezing in the winter. Preliminary results suggest that they flood their legs with warm blood at regular intervals and that they might even possess antifreeze proteins in their feet. We have also recently discovered that some migrant shorebirds use specific dietary lipids (omega-3 fatty acids from small mud shrimps they eat in large quantitites) as natural doping agents to prepare before long flights. We will test the effects of these lipids on the endurance capacity of captive quails and examine the mechanisms of action of these fatty acids. We will also investigate lipid metabolism in migrating sockeye salmon that swim upstream in the Fraser river to reach their spawning grounds. Besides improving knowledge of long-distance migrant physiology, this work has significant implications in the following areas: understanding the evolution of fuel selection strategies in vertebrates, characterizing new fundamental aspects of lipid metabolism, treating human obesity, finding new ways to increase the performance of human athletes, and formulating policies for wildlife conservation (protection of critical migrant bird habitats that provide unique dietary lipids).

"Translational medicine is a branch of research that attempts to improve the communication between life

sciences research and clinical practice in the health care sector. The two main goals are to (1) derive therapeutic insights from scientific ideas faster, and (2) to inspire new scientific ideas and to validate existing treatments based on clinical findings. Traditional interaction between the health care sector and the scientific community has been slow and expensive. Translational medicine uses information and communication technology (lCT) to establish a more effective feedback loop between science and health care practice.



Three functional requirements have been identified in literature as key enablers of translational medicine: data integration, clinical decision support and knowledge maintenance and provenance. This application addresses the first one by developing a draft proposal for a standards compliant exchange format to enable data integration in support of translational medicine. Another objective of the project is to study and advance computer-aided tool support for the model-driven development of data interoperability standards. This Collaborative Research & Development (CRD) application is an extension of an existing MITACS-funded industrial internship proposal, in which the data requirements for such a format have been researched in collaboration with several clinical and scientific collaborators.



Our industrial sponsor, Genologics Life Science Software is seeking the University of Victoria's (UVic)

assistance in developing a draft HL7-compliant standard specification for such a format. At the same time, UVic will benefit from gaining access to a real-world industrial case study to evaluate and advance previously developed tool support for model-based development of interoperability standards. The project will provide partial funding for an MSc student for one year. The knowledge and skills acquired during the course of this project are in high demand, while Canada is undertaking a major modernization of its health care system with ICT over the next decade.

"The objective of the proposed research program is to increase our industry's ability to  create and evaluate product-focussed security assurances about software. By ""product-focussed"" we mean assurances that are created and evaluated based on the software products themselves, rather than being based on secondary factors such as e.g., the development process, the developers or the developing organization. The vast majority of security assurances used in practice today are not product-focussed. They may rely on the vendor's claim of using ""best-practices"".

Why is product-focus important? Because it is a key enabler for reliable product certification. Our society depends on software infrastructure to take over increasingly sensitive services and history shows that self-regulation of critical products does not work. Therefore, governments are looking to independent bodies for product evaluation and certification services. For example, in case of an expert panel review of the pan-Canadian Electronic Health Record (EHR), the reviewers concluded that ""compliance with minimum privacy and security requirements should be subject to accreditation"". Another example is the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which imposes stringent requirements on companies' financial IT systems. Security assurances based on secondary factors such as the development process have proven unreliable, because process compliance can be faked, and there is little evidence that good processes necessarily result in good products.

Specific objectives of the research program are (1) to increase traceability between regulatory systems (using natural language) and software products, (2) to align and analyse multilateral security requirements with respect to possible interference, (3) to investigate qualitative and quantitative means of evaluating  security compliance, and (4) to find economic methods for re-evaluating subsequent software revisions. 

The project will contribute to training of highly qualified personnel in secure software engineering.

"The cerebellum, which is Latin for ""little brain"", is an area of the brain essential for fine-tuning complex movements. It is also important for motor learning, i.e. reinforcing movements that are advantageous. Arguably, the most important cells in the cerebellum that are responsible for these effects are Purkinje neurons, and they are an integral part of motor learning theory. Many specific genes and proteins are believed to contribute to the normal functions of Purkinje neurons at a molecular level. I plan to focus my studies on two proteins in particular, carbonic anhydrase type 8 protein (CAR8) and aldolase C. These protein families generally have enzymatic activity, and are important for pH balance and energy generation, respectively. However, CAR8 and aldolase C appear to have different roles in the cerebellum. In one portion of this research program we will study mice that have a mutation in the gene for CAR8, which exhibit a wobbly side-to-side movement, and are appropriately named waddles (wdl) mice. Using these mice, we will determine the physiological effects of a lack of CAR8 at the cellular level and study the effects of this mutation with well-established motor learning behavioural tests. These experiments will greatly enhance our understanding of genes and proteins that are necessary for normal motor coordination, thereby providing a major advancement in the field. In a second portion of the research program we will analyze the protective effects of aldolase C. Interestingly, only about one-third of Purkinje neurons express high levels of aldolase C, and those cells are more likely to survive insults such as ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury, than cells that do not express this protein. We have outlined a series of experiments in order to determine how this naturally occurring neuroprotective system works. The results should allow us to determine how to take advantage of this system, or how it could be manipulated, in order to protect other types of cells from traumatic insults. This may have implications for individuals who have suffered from stroke or trauma, as motor dysfunction is often associated with these types of pathologies.

"Predicting fracture of materials is a long-standing problem affecting manufacturing and transportation industries, and limiting the development of new fracture tolerant materials. The reasons come from difficulties in experimentally observing failure of materials and from the many microstructural parameters involved in the fracture process. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the relation between microstructure and fracture properties, in order to design materials with improved fracture resistance. The novelty of the present approach lies in the originality of the experimental techniques and in the precise coupling between experiments and modeling. Fracture generally takes place by the nucleation, growth and linkage of voids or cracks in a material. Using commercial materials to study fracture is difficult due to the large amount of parameters affecting it. In order to decouple these parameters, we have developed a simplified material (or model material) where the fracture process is controlled. It consists of metallic sheets in which voids are artificially introduced using a pulsed laser. The artificial voids mimic voids in commercial materials but in a simplified and controlled fashion. Such control over size and location of the voids provided by the laser drilling technique has never been achieved before and offers many opportunities to better understand fracture. Texture, twinning and lengthscale effects will be investigated in Ti, Mg and Cu samples. Growth and linkage of laser drilled hole in these samples will be monitored during in-situ tensile tests in 2D in a scanning electron microscope and in 3D in an x-ray computed tomography set-up. The outcome of this research program will contribute to our fundamental understanding of texture, twinning and lengthscale effects on fracture. On a more practical level, the knowledge expected from this research program would have a direct impact on the design of damage resistant materials in engineering fields where fracture is an issue such as transportation, manufacturing and nuclear industries.

"Automotive manufacturers are coming under increased regulatory pressures to improve the overall fleet mileage of their automobiles.  This has generated much interest in the development of advanced materials and manufacturing technologies, particularly those that reduce the weight of automotive components.  Laser welding of tailor welded blanks (TWB) is a new technology that has provided up to 30% weight savings for some sheet metal parts.  In this technique, blanks are made by welding together sheets of steel of different thickness with various galvanized coating thicknesses.  The resulting TWB is stamped to form a part.  For example, an inner door panel would be stamped from a TWB designed with thick sheet steel near the hinge attachment points for strength and thick galvanized (coated) sheet steel across the bottom for improved corrosion resistance. Further weight savings are possible using TWBs of aluminum (Al) alloys; however, the weldability of Al is very different than steel so new welding techniques are required for making TWBs from Al.  A unique welding technique with great potential for this application is double-sided arc welding (DSAW).  In DSAW, an arc is struck between two torches situated on either side of the sheets to be welded.  The arc simultaneously cleans the Al oxide off both the top and bottom sheet surfaces and welds the two sheets in a single operation.  However, DSAW has never been applied to high-speed welding of thin sheet nor fully characterized for use in the welding of Al alloys. The objectives of the proposed research are to investigate, optimize and assess the merits of DSAW for welding thin sheets of Al alloys for TWB and other applications.  The potential advantages of the DSAW process such as lower cost, better weld bead quality on both sides of the sheet, lower distortion, etc., will facilitate a more rapid transition to fabrication of lightweight Al autobodies, leading to cars with improved mileage and reduced environmental impact.  Development of the DSAW process for this application will also be of significant benefit to other manufacturing sectors including fabricators of lightweight transport vehicles such as trucks, trains and aircraft.","Double-sided arc welding of aluminum sheet","Manufacturing processes and products",CANADA,CANADA,"Design and manufacturing"

"There is an increasing demand for organic molecules with diverse structural features and functionality for use in the manufacturing of new materials, in the discovery of new medicines and in the chemical industry for the manufacture of fine chemicals. Novel bioactive molecules are also useful as ""tools"" for studying and understanding biochemical processes, which would have important implications in the advancement of medical research. Some of the molecules are not made by nature and others that occur in nature are only available in small amounts. Extracting such compounds from nature can have negative impacts on our environment and the ecosystem. Organic synthesis provides a way for making these molecules available and in sufficient quantities so that studies on their (bio)chemical and physical properties can be conducted. The proposed research is concerned with the design, study and development of new methods and catalysts for making of new compounds from simple organic building blocks. The ultimate goal in these studies is to develop practical methods that can be used for the synthesis of medicinally important, biologically active compounds. New drugs, such as anticancer,  antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory drugs, can benefit health of society. The results from the proposed studies will contribute to the knowledge base in the chemical sciences and to the advancement in chemical synthesis. The latter plays a vital role in the chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing sectors in Canada and hence the economy of Canada. Another important aspect of my research program is the training of graduates and undergraduates in the methodology of scientific inquiry and research, which helps ensure that Canada has the technological edge to compete in the global economy.

"The objectives of the ongoing research program are the development of powerful design tools capable of solving practical engineering problems associated with medium-structure-wave interaction.   Three dimensional medium-structure-wave interaction analysis is a computationally intensive task, consequently it is desirable to develop efficient numerical procedures for application to engineering problems.

     The proposed research is to extend and apply the numerical procedure outlined in [1]  to the following problems: i) the dynamic response of buried pipes in a seismic environment, ii) the dynamic response of submarine pipelines to nonlinear water waves and a seismic environment, iii) the dynamic response of layered viscoelastic medium.

     The results of the work proposed here would represent a number of significant contributions.  The study on the dynamic response of buried  pipelines to seismic waves will provide important design information currently not available in the literature.

    )	The study on the dynamic response of buried submarine pipelines to water waves and earthquakes is of paramount importance in B.C. because of the proposal to construct a natural gas pipeline across Georgia Strait to Vancouver Island.   The results may be useful in the decision on whether to lift the moratorium on offshore drilling off the coast of B.C. 

     The combination of the above projects will lead to the long term goal which is the development of state of the art programs capable of solving practical engineering problems associated with dynamic medium-structure-wave systems.

"Bridges form a critical component of the transportation network upon which the Canadian economy depends.  It is therefore imperative that the condition or ""health"" of bridges be maintained at an acceptable level to ensure public safety and sustain adequate levels of service.  As the bridge population ages and individual bridge structures deteriorate, it becomes increasingly important to have an accurate assessment of their condition so that decisions can be made regarding the timing and extent of needed repairs.  Conceptually, this can be achieved through various forms of monitoring.  In general, the earlier damage can be detected and repaired, the less it will cost to maintain in the long-term.  Unfortunately, current monitoring methods are often not able to provide sufficient information to allow the detection of damage at an early enough stage in its development.  Visual inspections, which form the basis for most bridge monitoring strategies, have been found to be remarkably unreliable.  Other technology based methods are often costly and time consuming to implement and are not necessarily capable of identifying damage to the inaccessible parts of a bridge.  This proposal focuses on an alternative approach to monitoring that relies on measuring changes to the way a bridge vibrates as an indicator of the presence of damage; this approach does not suffer from the same limitations.

   Earlier research has shown that the vibration-based approach can detect damage quite reliably and accurately when large amounts of data are available and simple models of bridge structures are considered.  The proposed research will investigate ways of applying the approach to more realistic bridge structures when less data are available.  This will make the method more attractive for application on real bridges.  The goal is to develop the vibration-based approach as a practical and routinely applied monitoring method.  This achievement has the potential to increase the general safety of bridges in Canada and generate significant cost savings to Canadian tax-payers as bridge repair and maintenance is more cost-effectively performed.

"The past few decades have seen a wealth of novel electron-ordering phenomena discovered in complex oxide and intermetallic materials. These phenomena range from unconventional superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance to magnetoelectric multiferroism. Recent advances in nanofabrication and nanoprobe

techniques, together with progress in cryomagnetic instrumentation, have enabled these materials to be studied

at very short length scales with controlled geometries and under extreme thermodynamic conditions. 



My proposed research is to apply a combination of nanofabrication, nanoprobe and cryomagnetic techniques on various complex oxides and novel intermetallics. The materials include: the high-Tc superconductors YBa2Cu3O6+x and Tl-doped cuprates; the heavy-fermion superconductors CeCoIn5, PrOs4Sb12, CePt3Si; the colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) compound La0.7Ca0.3MnO3; and the multiferroic compounds BiFeO3, HoMnO3, TbMn2O5. 



Both epitaxial thin-film and single crystal samples will be studied, as well as nanostructured samples made using laser ablated deposition and electron beam lithography.  This research approach is progressive in that it experimentally extends the study of strongly-correlated electrons in complex materials to crystal-lattice length scales. 



If successful, the proposed research could enable technological innovations in new forms of electronic devices based on various quantum-ordered phenomena. Such ""quantum"" devices would have significant application

"Summary



In-stream wood or large woody debris (LWD) in forested streams is one of most important contributions of habitat and cover for fish populations. LWD has been intensively studied at the reach scale. However, little is known about variability of LWD and its ecological functions at multiple spatial scales.  Swanson (2003) suggested that a landscape perspective on LWD ecology over river networks and through time is one of the most needed future research directions. It is widely accepted that forest sustainability must be defined in temporal and spatial scales.  Studying natural disturbance is useful for understanding ecological processes and patterns at temporal scales. This is particularly important for the Canadian forests because of frequent wildfire.   

Funded by a NSERC discovery grant, my first five-year (2002-2006) research project mainly focused on LWD long-term dynamics (temporal scales) in harvested and wildfire-disturbed forest watersheds in the BC interior. This new proposed research (2007-2011) will target LWD ecology over river networks at multiple spatial scales. My specific objectives include: (1) quantification of relations between LWD loadings and their ecological functions at various stream orders; (2) comparison of the above relations between wildfire and harvesting disturbances; and (3) determination of key mechanisms controlling LWD amount and distribution over river networks.  My long-term research goals are: (1) to integrate information of LWD loadings and functions at both spatial and temporal scales to fully understand LWD ecology; and (2) to link our results with sustainable forest and watershed management in the Canadian sub-boreal watersheds.

"SUMMARY

Ammonia is a highly toxic waste product derived from the breakdown of proteins. It can cause severe damage to cells and is often fatal to the organism if blood levels exceed critical limits. In aquatic invertebrates ammonia is excreted directly from the body fluids into the environment and is not transformed into less toxic molecules such as urea or uric acid as is found in terrestrial vertebrates and birds. To avoid the toxic effects of ammonia aquatic invertebrates have evolved highly efficient excretory mechanisms particularly in their gills. One invertebrate model that has been used for the study of ammonia excretion is the green shore crab, Carcinus maenas. Ammonia transporters and transport mechanisms including molecular evidence for a Rh-like protein have been described in this species. These proteins have only very recently been identified in mammals and act as specific transporters by which ammonia crosses epithelial tissues such as the nephron of the kidney. However, their role in the overall transport process of ammonia is still unknown. The crab gill represents an excellent model system to understand the role of Rh-proteins in epithelial ammonia excretion. Combining transport physiological experiments and a variety of molecular biological techniques, this program will investigate the epithelial transport of ammonia, its regulation, and the link to salt and water balance in invertebrates. New discoveries will identify ammonia transport mechanisms, proteins and genes involved in ammonia stress responses in crustaceans and will help us to better understand the physiology of aquatic invertebrates. Further, information gained from the proposed program could be transferred to similar studies involving ammonia and ion balance in vertebrates including fish and mammals which have economical (aqua culture), environmental and medical (hepatic encephalopathy) relevance.

"Measurement of bone is complex since not only does bone have different shapes, but it has different types and layers.  For example the typical Swiss cheese network inside of bone is called trabecular bone and the hard outer shell is called cortical bone.  As bones grow, calcium and other minerals are deposited on the outside of bone and also on the inside of bone.  The inner trabecular bone is vital for keeping blood calcium constant, this is required for general health.  The outer shell is important for bone strength.  When one or both areas are reduced, bones can break.  Scientists are not only interested in dietary calcium, but other nutrients like omega fats and protein that modulate how much calcium is deposited.  Furthermore, immune cells also interact with bone causing higher risk for bones to break.  This team of researchers at McGill is looking at how nutrition, energy metabolism and the immune system might interact to result in better bones and now wish to look deeper inside the bone.  In order to look inside bone and determine how much trabecular and cortical bone exists the researchers are applying for a sophisticated x-ray machine that can be used without harming the animal.  The machine is called a micro computed tomography machine.  Adding this high-tec machine is important to all of the trainees involved since not only is it representative of the most widely accepted methodology, but it will permit them to learn on the most up to date equipment and to establish how nutrients and the immune system alter bone.","Micro computed tomography unit for measuring volumetric bone density in small animals","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal physiology and metabolism"

"Global warming will drastically alter Canada's vegetation landscape, thereby presenting challenges for forest management, preservation of natural sites, weed control and delivery of ecosystem services.  Climate change is arguably Canada's most pervasive environmental threat since all other such problems have a climatic element.  The short time scale of global warming leads many to think about its biological consequences in ecological terms. Many predict pole-ward migration from more thermally adapted populations from the south.  Others anticipate phenotypicaly plastic shifts in physiology and development in resident populations.  Such responses can ameliorate the impact on natural populations, but only to the degree allowed by their current genetic repertoire. Importantly, altered climate imposes altered selection regimes and hence the total biological response to global warming will have evolutionary dimensions.  A small number of studies, including one form my group, already indicate evolutionary responses climate change.  Evolutionary change on a decadal time frame could be widespread among species with short to medium life cycles.  I propose a research program to understand the rate of evolutionary change-particularly genetic adaptation to extended growing seasons-and how natural selection, gene flow, and non-random mating might affect it.  Projects will test specific hypotheses, including: 1. Although pole-ward migrants may bring thermal tolerance genes, introgression of these adaptive loci will be inhibited by a) gametic (linkage) disequilibrium with loci causing maladaptive reproductive phenology under the photoperiodic cycle of northern latitudes, and b) assortative mating caused by this maladaptive phenology; 2. Extended growing seasons will select for delayed flowering times in resident populations; 3. Evolutionary shifts in flowering time are accelerated by phenolgical assortative mating; and 4.  The rate of evolutionary response to climate change increases with latitude.  The program will employ several species of annual and short-lived perennial plants, and will be executed with the use of artificial warming plots at the Koffler Scientific Reserve at Jokers Hill.","Climate change and evolution of plant phenology",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Evolution and ecology"
"Modern geochemistry is concerned with quantifying and explaining the transfer of elements within and between the different major geological reservoirs of the Earth, including the mantle, the crust, the oceans, and the atmosphere. To accomplish this task requires the precise analysis of isotopic ratios and elemental concentrations in minerals, solutions, or organic matter. The recent development of multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) has opened up new important avenues for producing ground-breaking research in isotopic and tracer geochemistry. The method involves coupling a plasma source with a large dispersion magnetic sector multiple collector mass spectrometer and is capable of high ionization efficiency for nearly all elements. This has dramatically expanded the potential isotopic systems that can be measured (e.g. isotopes of Cd, Zn, Cu, Fe, Cr, Si) and has also allowed for unprecedented sensitivity and precision in the analysis of isotopic systems previously determined by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) (e.g. isotopes of Hf, Pb). The long-term objective of the proposed 5-year research program is to evaluate the geochemical evolution of our planet and its environment through the use of isotopic geochemistry and the new analytical possibilities offered by MC-ICP-MS. Important topics to be addressed include: Pb-Hf-Sr-Nd isotopic geochemistry of the Earth's mantle (mantle plumes, oceanic islands, large igneous provinces), precise isotopic analyses of reference materials, and mass fractionation in heavy stable isotope systems (Fe, Cr, Si, Cd, Zn, Mg) and their environmental applications. The proposed research program takes advantage of the MC-ICP-MS instrument and other analytical capabilities of the Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research (PCIGR) at UBC, which is a major geochemical facility that I direct and provides support for new research initiatives, contributes to the training of highly-qualified personnel, and fosters important new collaborations with scientists at the regional, national and international levels.

"The Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research (PCIGR) is a major analytical facility dedicated to innovation in geochemistry that is housed in the Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences (EOS) at the University of British Columbia. This facility serves the earth, environmental, oceanographic, atmospheric and biological science research needs of investigators from universities from across Canada and other countries, government agencies, and the mineral industry. The primary goals of the PCIGR are (1) to provide a fully integrated analytical facility to stimulate new avenues of research in the earth, ocean, and environmental sciences, (2) to establish productive collaborations with other disciplines, such as the medical, biological, and chemical sciences, (3) to attract and retain researchers from the Canadian and international scientific communities, and (4) to provide high-quality analytical services. The proposed research themes include: global climate studies, geochemical tracers in the Earth's mantle and lithosphere, marine biogeochemical cycles, paleoceanography, environmental geochemistry, timescales and rates of geologic processes, and metals in the Earth. The broad range of geochemical research that is carried out at the PCIGR is unique to Canada and truly multi-disciplinary, reflecting the range of expertise and research interests of the users of the PCIGR. The facility is centred around the analytical capabilities of 7 mass spectrometers housed in new clean rooms, an array of elemental and gas analyzers, 3 new chemical clean laboratories, and an inorganic geochemical laboratory. Isotopic and chemical systems currently under investigation include radiogenic isotopes in tracer (Th-Pa, Pb-Pb, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf) and geochronological studies (U-Pb, Ar-Ar), heavy stable isotopes in geologic and biologic materials (Fe, Mo, Cd, Mg, Cu, Zn, Li), light stable isotopes (C, O, H, N) in carbonate minerals, sediments, waters, and gases, and trace element characterization of earth, ocean, and environmental materials.","Pacific centre for isotopic and geochemical research","Earth sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Geochemistry and geochronology"

"The natural numbers have associated mysteries.For example,it has long been known that the Riemann zeta function,which is built from them,'knows' the distribution of the prime numbers,in the sense that this data is encoded in it.

  The study of natural numbers leads to algebraic numbers,which also have their zeta functions and the mystery of what they 'know'.There seems to be much more structural information of this kind which is only gradually being unravelled.

  The algebraic numbers also have symmetries,and it turns out that the zeta functions 'know'a lot about these.In particular,the Main Conjecture of Iwasawa theory predicted a very detailed such connection which was proved by A.Wiles in 1990.

  More recently,a refined 'equivariant' form of the Main Conjecture has been formulated,motivated by concrete problems about these symmetries.The main goal of this proposal is to work toward a proof of this 'equivariant'Main Conjecture.

  The investigation of the difficulties raised by this attempt are a secondary goal of the proposal.Finally,there is some work in progress,only somewhat related,which I would like to continue with,and hopefully complete.This concerns the group theoretic limitations on the kernel of capitulation in an unramified non-abelian extension of algebraic number fields.

"Complex, high-dimensional data arise in many important classification problems. For example, in drug discovery, drug-like molecules are characterized by hundreds or thousands of chemical descriptor variables. The classification problem is to model the relationship between the chemical descriptors and the active/inactive assay response desired of the drug being developed, e.g., binding to a particular enzyme. Another data challenge is that active compounds are very rare in the assay data used to train models (the rare-class of interest problem).



As another example, in real-time genotyping for clinical intervention, multiple, redundant probes are used to compensate for the quick, and hence less reliable, chemistries employed. Here, the classification problem is to choose among the probe signal variables and determine which are most useful for genotyping each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), arguably the source of most genetic variation in humans, for a particular patient sample. Automated, real-time genotyping is an important step in personalized medicine. For clinical decisions, classification accuracy needs to be very close to 100%.



This proposal has three main components: (1) new modelling methods to improve classification accuracy; (2) methods for selecting among high-dimensional or redundant explanatory variables; and (3) computationally efficient cross-validation for assessment, tuning, and comparison of models or explanatory variable sets in terms of prediction accuracy.  Although the scientific application focus is in drug discovery and genotyping, all the classification problems mentioned - rare class of interest, variable selection, model selection, and efficient cross validation - are pervasive in an extremely broad range of scientific disciplines.

"Environmental pollutants are a serious threat, not only to our ecosystems but also to human health. These chemicals collect in lakes and rivers, through run-off and waste disposal from industrial and municipal processes such as waste-water treatment plants, agriculture, mining, pulp and paper mills, oil and gas extraction, amongst others. A recently discovered group of pollutants has structural similarity to natural sex hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone. These compounds have been shown to interact with the same sites in our bodies as natural hormones, and have a disruptive effect on metabolism. As a result of this interaction with the endocrine system, they are called endocrine disrupting chemicals, or EDCs. In the long-term, numerous health defects may be associated with EDCs.

This proposal aims to examine the impact of EDCs both in intact fish and human cell line systems. The goal is to find the mechanisms by which EDCs disrupt metabolism using advanced analytical platforms for metabolite profiling. We will use a technique called 'metabolomics' which is a younger relative to genomics and proteomics technologies. Metabolomics allows us to take a snapshot of many biological processes at the same time in a cost-effective manner. By comparing the snapshots of fish or cells exposed to EDCs to those without exposure, we will gain an understanding of the metabolic shifts which take place. The tools for metabolomics are nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). The NMR analysis will build on state-of-the-art tools such as Targeted Profiling, and the MS on established libraries and novel technology development for tracking unknown peaks.

In the long-term, the results from this research program will allow us to determine the impact of waterborne contaminants using a metabolic test. This will open the door for possible of remediation of contaminated waterways or more stringent guidelines for chemical treatment and disposal. In addition, it will provide evolutionary insight into the different mechanisms of fish and human response to EDCs.

"One of the most significant global challenges of the 21st century is fostering economic growth while meeting societal and environmental objectives. This is particularly true in Canada that has developed a highly energy-intensive economy based on natural resource extraction and processing. Although this industry requires the use of significant energy, it also creates noteworthy wealth: it generated 60 billion dollars for the economy, in 2006.  There is a clear need to improve the energy use in these industries via a knowledge based approach. 



A key component to this is the development of novel processing routes which are more energy efficient. An example of this is the energy and cost savings incentives in the metallurgical industries to move away from traditional processing routes towards near net shape processing such as strip casting.  However, little is known of the effect of the strip casting process on the microstructure evolution during processing and final material properties.



This research project will investigate and model the effect of processing history on microstructure evolution for traditional Direct Chill (DC) and strip cast aluminum alloys. This work will be conducted on the commercially significant and relatively new AA6111 aluminum automotive sheet alloy. 



The research proposed in this project will lead to advanced knowledge in the area of strip casting AA6111 and the effect this novel processing route will have on final product properties. The work will lead to the education of four highly skilled people in the areas of thermal/stress mathematical modelling of thermomechanical processes as well as material behaviour during deformation.

"The rapidly growing fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine are striving to direct the growth and development of tissue replacements that capture the mechanical function of native tissues. A particular challenge is the reproduction of load-bearing elastic tissues which must stretch and recoil with minimal energy loss. The major stumbling block in tissue engineering has been the inability to grow the important structural elastic fibers that are the main rubbery component in these tissues. The proposed research takes a completely novel and interdisciplinary approach to this problem by using tools from materials science and engineering to investigate the structural and functional development of elastic fibers in natural tissues. Our belief is that the best lessons for tissue engineering design will come from understanding the complex structural-functional relationships of developing fetal tissues and how these tissue adapt to alterations in their mechanical loading conditions. 



Using materials science and engineering techniques, we will describe the structural and mechanical changes in the elastic fibers during development from fetal to adult life (in cows): starting from the formation of a microfibrillar scaffold in early gestation. We will also examine the lobster and lamprey aorta: elastic tissues rich in microfibrils, but devoid of elastin. We hypothesize that the mechanisms of elasticity of the highly microfibrillar fetal elastic tissues are similar to those found in the lobster aorta and elastic tissues of other lower animals. We will also examine the structural/mechanical changes in aortic elastin structures as this artery undergoes dramatic remodeling during pregnancy. Understanding the mechanics of elastic tissue, and how its elastic mechanisms change during development and remodeling, will aid in the tissue engineering of arterial replacements.

"To satisfy the requirement of the reduction in green house gases from automobile emissions, new powertrain systems such as batteries and ultracapacitors are being developed for plug-in electric vehicles. Attributing to their unique electrochemical properties, carbon nanotubes have drawn an ever-increasing attention since their integration in powertrain systems promises an improved energy conversion efficiency and an increased storage capacity. Specifically, there are two major merits that this nanomaterial can bring about: i) longer life time and ii) higher energy density, both of which may significantly reduce cost and preserve energy for the automotive industry and consumers. 

    While the combustion synthesis of nanotubes provides an easily scalable process due to its self-sustainable energy and material supplies, the complexity of combustion itself and the parallel formation mechanisms of the nano-sized catalyst and carbon nanotubes have challenged researchers. This research program proposes both experimental and numerical studies for optimizing the combustion synthesis and improving material purification with a coherent focus on investigations of the formation mechanism and structure characterization of catalyst nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. To optimize the combustion synthesis for large-scale production and to satisfy green engineering principles, a new flame process based on a staged combustion technology will be designed and investigated. The objective of this research is to reveal the formation mechanisms and particle dynamics of nanostructures in combustion and to achieve the selective production of nanomaterials which will be characterized and purified for applications in transportation based energy systems.

    This discovery grant will support the first Canadian research team to investigate the chemical and physical fundamentals during the combustion synthesis of nanomaterials.

These advances have been essential to address the increasing complexity of the analytical samples and the questions posed by scientists from diverse fields of study. Nowhere is this more true than in the nascent field of systems biology, which promises not only a broader understanding of biological processes, but concomitant advances in areas such as drug discovery and personalized medicine.

The challenge of finding meaning in the complex relationships embodied in multivariate measurements requires a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on elements of statistics, computer science, biology and chemistry. It is this challenge that is the focus of the applicant's proposed research program, which seeks to identify new chemometric and bioinformatics methods to address the needs of scientific inquiry. The proposed work emphasizes the necessity of understanding the intricate nature of measurement errors in modern analytical and biological techniques, and the development of methods to use to this knowledge effectively for the optimal extraction of information. In particular, research will concentrate on transcriptomics (the study of gene expression in cells) and metabolomics (the study of metabolic signatures of organisms), using data for a variety of organisms including yeast, fruit flies and a malaria parasite. Fundamental biological insights will be sought by trying to model the dymamic relationships among genes or metabolites in systems undergoing change. The ultimate goal is a better understanding of regulatory mechanisms in living organisms.

"Deposition of thin films and etching operations via the use of ""cold"" (thermodynamically non-equilibrium) low-pressure (LP) plasmas achieved fundamental importance in the semiconductor and information technology industries since the 1960s. Those two operations categories and a third, surface modification of plastics (polymers), are now also being used in numerous other industrial sectors. In recent years there has been much progress towards implementing atmospheric-pressure (AP) ""cold"" plasmas, primarily of the dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) variety, for those three process categories. Research in the applicant's laboratory of all the types mentioned above has over the years resulted in over 400 publications and in more than two dozen patents. His work is internationally known, has led to a Killam Research Fellowship (1990-92), to the creation of an NSERC Industrial Research Chair (IRC, 1996-2006), and to much technology transfer towards industry. Objectives of the proposed program extension will be to continue developing new materials, diagnostics and modelling studies designed to elucidate fundamental plasma phenomena, and development of novel applications and devices. Beside the direct use of LP and AP plasmas, the applicant is also investigating the treatment of materials within the above three process categories by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photo-physical chemistry: The potential advantage of (monochromatic) photons over plasmas is that the former can enable more ""targeted"", specific reaction pathways than the latter, thereby leading to much-enhanced processing efficiency. The availability of commercial VUV lamps, all based on LP or AP discharge plasmas, is rendering the photochemical route economically attractive. Proposed future research will primarily aim at biomaterials (""tissue engineering"") applications, in collaboration with colleagues in the medical faculties at McGill and UMontrï¿½al, and with other members of the ""Groupe de recherche en sciences et technologies biomï¿½dicales (GRSTB)"" at ï¿½cole Polytechnique.

"Canada's canola industry is worth an estimated $ 3 billion in seed and oil exports, and $13.8 billion in associated activity to the national economy each year.  Globally, rising incomes, population growth, and an urgent need for renewable liquid fuels is driving an unprecedented demand for seed oils. The overall goal of my research program is to understand how seed oil formation is controlled as a basis for developing canola with increased seed oil content or oil with desired properties for food and non-food applications. During seed development, a series of oil-building enzymes drive the formation of seed oil.  The action of these enzymes can influence both the quantity of oil formed and the composition and properties of the oil.  The proposed research program focuses on the enzymes driving the first and last of the reactions in the oil-building pathway.  We will learn how the structure of the last enzyme in the pathway affects the ability of the enzyme to do its job. In addition, we intend to study how the enzyme interacts with the membrane network within the oil forming plant cell. All of this information will be useful in designing ""high performance"" forms of the enzyme for use in canola biotechnology to increase seed oil content and/or modify seed oil quality. In research with the first enzyme in the oil-building pathway, we will investigate how the information in the ""genetic blueprint"" of the oil-forming cell is converted to functioning enzyme and how the quantity of this enzyme is controlled during seed development. My research on plant oil formation relies on methods from numerous disciplines including biochemistry, molecular biology, breeding, tissue culture and analytical chemistry. The proposed research program will also contribute to the training of highly qualified personnel in the burgeoning area of plant lipid research.

"All-optical data processing as an alternative to electronic data processing is critical to the telecommunications and computing fields, due to the theoretically orders-of-magnitude increase in operating speed. To realize this technology in a compact platform, nonlinear (NL) waveguide photonics are used. Here, an optical ""pump"" beam alters the physical environment of an optical data pulse, causing it to be passed, blocked, re-directed, etc.; the degree of NL response is proportional to the power density of the pump. Unfortunately, photonic waveguides have a minimum size that is limited by physical considerations, requiring unacceptably high pump powers in order to produce a useful NL response. Plasmonic waveguides, however, can confine optical fields into a cross-section that is one to two orders of magnitude smaller, facilitating NL effects at correspondingly reduced powers. These unique structures manipulate surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) - rather than photons - at the nanoscale (a SPP results from the coupling of the electromagnetic field with oscillating electrons at the surface of a metal.) 

     The goal of my research is to design nonlinear plasmonic waveguide (NLPW) devices for applications in low-power all-optical logic and data routing. This program aims to address numerous fundamental and applied aspects of NLPW technology. Particular issues that must be resolved include: how can we ensure the existence of guided NL plasmonic modes in the frequency/intensity regime of interest? What materials and SPP frequencies are best suited for NLPWs, both in terms of device functionality and technological feasibility? What figures of merit can best describe NLPW devices, and how are they optimized in the waveguide design stage? What assumptions of photonics modeling are no longer valid in the plasmonic realm, and how can these be properly modified? Is there a fundamental limit to the confinement of SPPs? As these and other questions are answered, the realization of NLPW devices is certain to revolutionize the fields of telecommunications and computing.

"Nanosystems in Transplantation:

Blood group antigens as immunologic tolerogens for infant heart transplantation

In heart transplantation, blood group matching between donor and recipient is necessary to prevent a rapid form of rejection called 'hyperacute' rejection, which results in loss of the transplant or patient death. Recent studies showed, however, that blood group mismatched heart transplants are possible when performed in infancy. The success of these transplants lies in the normal lag in development of certain antibodies in infants. Thus, during infancy, absence of ABO-antibodies allows safe heart transplantation from a mismatched donor. Furthermore, the mismatched transplant does not provoke new antibodies to be formed; indeed, the foreign blood group substances on the transplanted heart were shown to induce a state of'tolerance', which actually prevents development of these antibodies as the infant grows into childhood. Despite these successes, the availability of donor organs for infants is particularly low. Increasing the length of this immunological 'grace period' would allow transplants to be performed at an older age when donor organs may be more readily available. The goal of this project is to test the ability of artificial blood group substances to induce tolerance during immaturity in a similar manner as mismatched heart transplants. If successful, this would lead to a lengthening of the window during which blood group mismatched heart transplants can be performed safely, allowing more children to be transplanted. This project is collaboration between Prof. Lori West, UofA Dept. of Pediatrics, Director of Heart Transplant Research, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Prof. Todd Lowary, UofA Dept. of Chemistry/Alberta Ingenuity Centre for Carbohydrate Science, and Prof. Jillian Buriak, UofA Dept. of Chemistry/NRC National Institute of Nanotechnology. This is an exciting and entirely novel multidisciplinary project with enormous clinical potential, which combines the expertise of diverse areas of research in chemistry and medicine.

To address uncertainties in storage-yield dynamics in mountain regions, new observations are needed that characterize the hydrologic processes and biological activities govern the routing of water from higher elevation areas to neighbouring lowlands through wide valleys. In these valleys, water can be temporarily stored in shallow aquifers and/or in wetlands that are mostly created or maintained by beaver. The magnitude and rate of change in storage of shallow valley aquifers and valley wetlands will be measured in this research programme. Also, the hydrologic connectivity of the valley aquifer to the stream will be assessed through using a combination of hydrometric, hydrochemical and isotopic methods. Field-based measurements of the effect of beaver on flow routing through the valley will be made. All observations will take place in the Sibbald Lake Research Basin, located in Kananaskis Country, Alberta. Water from this basin drains into the Bow River and then to the South Saskatchewan River, which provides critical water for agricultural, industrial, and urban use. The observations made with this equipment will provide an improved science base that integrates stream-groundwater-wetland interactions and incorporates effects of biological activities (e.g. beaver) necessary to meet current and future water resource management and hydrologic modeling challenges in mountain regions.

"Plant cells are surrounded by a semi-rigid wall. This cell wall plays a critical role in almost all aspects of plant existence, ranging from plant growth, to cell and tissue cohesion, to interactions between cells and their environment. Thus, it is critical to understand the structure, production and modification of cell walls. Plant cell walls are primarily composed of polysaccharides: cellulose microfibrils are crosslinked via hemicellulose chains and embedded in a stiff gel of pectins. While cellulose is well-known for its structural role in determining the strength of the wall, pectins play key roles in cell-cell adhesion and modulating the fluidity and porosity of the wall. My long-term objective is to understand not only how pectins are synthesized and transported to the cell exterior, but also how these processes are regulated at the cellular level. Insight from my research provides valuable information that will contribute to the Canadian bio-based economy, particularly plant cell wall-based industrial, energy and agricultural products (e.g. wood, fibres, paper). 

     To study plant cell wall biology with a focus on pectin polysaccharides, I have established the mucilage secretory cells of the Arabidopsis thaliana seed coat as a model system. Seed coat mucilages are primarily composed of pectin and, in nature, are believed to promote germination through the formation of a hydrophilic gel that holds water around seeds. By taking advantage of this pectin production in the seeds of the genetic model plant, Arabidopsis, I am able to use a combination of genetics, molecular biology and cell biology to investigate cell wall biology as well as mucilage production in general. The main streams of my current research proposal are to (1) characterize the roles of some newly identified genes affecting mucilage (pectin) production and secretion, and (2) investigate the cell biology of mucilage secretion in living mucilage cells using fluorescent markers. The results from these projects will help eluciate the mechanisms of pectin synthesis and secretion by the addition of new players in these processes as well as greater understanding of the pathway of pectin secretion within plant cells.

"Humans interact with objects all the time.  Vision is the sense that is most commonly used to acquire information about objects.  Although we have learned a great deal about the visual control of action over the last decade, we are still far from a complete understanding.  Interestingly, research has shown that our perception of objects is quite distinct from our ability to interact with those objects.  For example, perceptual illusions do not typically affect our actions even though they create biases in our perception of the target object's features.  The situation changes, however, when people interact with objects that are blocked from view, or that are viewed with one eye closed.  In these situations, perception of the object seems to be more important for guiding action.  The studies to be carried out here will help to understand the complex interactions between conscious perception and visual control of action.  Fundamental understanding of these interactions may help to provide guidance to rehabilitation therapists working with individuals who have visual or neurological disorders.","Perception and action in human visual behaviour",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Motor systems and performance"

"The unique structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which contains the genetic makeup of living organisms, provides a useful template from which to design and build innovative molecules with important applications in science. Indeed, modified DNA pieces have been designed for, and are used in, medicine (drugs that bind to regions in DNA responsible for disease), biotechnology (bioprobes used to study the structure and function of enzymes) and nanotechnology (DNA mediated synthesis of materials and devices on the nanoscale). Despite these useful applications, modified DNA is detrimental when formed within cells, where DNA damage can be formed due to external forces (X-rays, UV light) or internal processes (replication errors, lipid peroxidation) and has been linked to diseases such as cancer.

     The proposed research uses computational chemistry to study the properties and reactivity of natural and modified DNA components with important roles in biology, biochemistry and medicine. Computational chemistry uses computer calculations to obtain information about chemical systems. Computational chemistry is a useful tool to study modified DNA since calculations can be readily carried out for both normal, stable molecules and reactive species, where experiments on the latter are difficult or impossible. Therefore, calculations can be used to complement and/or guide experiment.

     Our research will study the chemical removal of damaged DNA that is facilitated by enzymes in our bodies. We will also study the pathways through which the damage forms. By understanding both how nature repairs the damage and how the damage occurs, scientists may be able to develop more effective techniques to repair or prevent DNA damage. We will also study a wide range of chemically modified DNA pieces that have applications as drugs or tools for biotechnology in anticipation to identify new molecules to be made and tested in a traditional experimental laboratory.

"My research areas are mathematical modelling and scientific computation with application to hydrogen fuel cells. Using mathematical modelling, I develop equations that approximately describe the operating fuel cell. The equations are approximate because not all aspects of what is happening in the cell can be included. The resulting equations cannot be solved precisely, but approximate solutions can be found using computers (scientific computing) . We now have a model of an operating fuel cell that can be simulated on a computer. The model is not exact. However, it can be used to investigate how the fuel cell works less expensively than experimental testing. Optimizing fuel cell designs can be done more quickly using the computational model. What the likely failure modes of the fuel cell are and how tolerant the operation is to component tolerances - all these can be modelled computationally. Confidence in the model is only built by comparing it to some experimental measurements. When the model does not match the experiments, the model must be modified (more things not originally included must be added). Some additions to the model involve new mathematics. I work to understand the new terms better analytically. If they appropriately describe the process I want them to describe, I work to figure out how to compute them efficiently. I propose specifically to develop computational models of the start-up of Polymer Electrolyte Membrane hydrogen fuel cells. As hydrogen is introduced into the cell, a situation can exist where there is a reverse current near the air outlet. This current degrades the fuel cell catalyst layer, and is one of the major limitations of fuel cell lifetime in current designs. Capturing this effect in a computational model would allow virtual (fast and inexpensive) testing of mitigation strategies. My main mathematical interest is in understanding models of combined air and water flow in porous media and efficiently computing approximate solutions. The line dividing areas where there is water and where there is only air is known as a free boundary. I am interested in computational methods for general free boundary value problems.

"We propose to develop a unique high-throughput screening tool that will be useful for early-stage

pharmaceutical discovery. The new tool will rely on digital microfluidics (DMF), a technology in which

droplets are manipulated on an open platform without any moving parts, valves or tubes. DMF enables fluid

handling operations such as translating, merging, mixing and splitting of droplets, which can be utilized to

perform large, parallel-scale bioassays. We propose to build a prototype instrument in which DMF-driven

arrays of droplets containing mammalian cells are addressed with compounds from chemical libraries, and the

potential drugs evaluated on the basis of observed changes in cells. The new method will facilitate

100-1000-fold reduction in reagent use, and will be compatible with standard laboratory instruments and

infrastructure. We will demonstrate the utility of the new technique by implementing a pilot screen to discover

""hits"" with (potential) anti-cancer activity.

This proposal is built on our preliminary work, in which we developed the first cell-based assays in droplets on

a DMF platform. Working with The Innovation Group at the University of Toronto, we recently filed several

patents describing these (and other) innovations related to digital microfluidics. This work has attracted the

attention of several prospective industrial partners including Tecan Group Ltd. (an international leader in the

liquid handling and multiplexed analysis markets) and the pharmaceutical giant, Eli Lilly. We hope that

NSERC will fund this proposal, which will support the development of a new Canadian-grown technology that

has the potential to revolutionize high-throughput screening and drug discovery.","Digital microfluidics for multiplexed cell-based screening","Human pharmaceuticals",CANADA,CANADA,"Bioanalytical chemistry"
"The work proposed here takes the form of two related streams, and is focused on developing lab-on-a-chip methods to solve critical problems in bioanalysis.



Stream 1:  Many important biological analyses require both (a) extensive sample processing and (b) high-resolution separations. For example, in a common type of clinical analysis used to diagnose and prognosticate disease, samples of serum are collected and subjected to a rigorous processing regimen which can require several days to complete, followed by separations and mass spectrometry. Unfortunately, there are no standardized and automated methods capable of integrating these techniques, which results in non-repeatable results, limiting their clinical utility. We propose to integrate and miniaturize sample preparation and separations using hybrid devices relying on droplets and microchannels. If successful, this new method will represent an important advance in the field of clinical proteomics, and more generally, will be a useful new tool for the wide range of applications requiring sample processing and separations.



Stream 2: Integrated robotic workstations are revolutionizing the life sciences, enabling high-throughput screening (HTS) on an unprecedented scale. Such technology does not come cheap, however - robotic workstations are expensive, and the consumables costs effectively limit this powerful technology to a few pharmaceutical companies that have the means to use it. In response to this challenge, we propose to develop high-throughput, low-volume screening techniques relying on droplets in miniaturized devices. If successful, this advance will make HTS accessible to all scientists, regardless of resources, which should lead to better and faster drug discovery, as well as new discoveries in biology and medicine.

"Names are the currency of biodiversity. Knowing the name of an organism not only allows one to identify it, but provides access to all other knowledge about that organism. Although we share the planet with millions of species of insects, only a fraction of those species has scientific names, and the percentage of species for which we have reasonable ecological and evolutionary knowledge is vanishingly small. The primary objective of my research program is the systematics of flies (Diptera), one of the four largest insect orders on Earth, and Canada's most species-rich group of insects. We describe new species in a range of Diptera families and provide identification tools that allow other workers to attach names to specimens. 

    )	The description of species is, however, a beginning, not an end. Systematic knowledge is the foundation for the other primary foci of my program. Once species are known, reconstructing their phylogenetic relationships provides a predictive framework for understanding the evolution of other traits of those species. I will generate phylogenetic hypotheses on two large, widespread tribes of grass flies (Chloropidae) that occupy a broad range of ecological roles, in order to frame hypotheses on the origins and evolution of that ecological diversity. 

    )	The ability to identify flies to the species level also gives greater resolution in ecological studies. We have found that higher Diptera are very diverse in apparently homogeneous habitats, but those assemblages can be made up of very different sets of species from site to site. I will explore the underlying reasons for this pattern by studying the dispersal ability and colonization patterns of chloropid flies and related Diptera in habitat patches at multiple scales from small, similar, local patches (bird nests) through habitat fragments (peatlands, old field quadrats) up to continental scales (an east-west transect in North America) to test whether patterns apparent at one scale apply at other scales, and to determine to what extent phylogenetic history, ecological similarity, and neutral processes contribute to the assembly of species assemblages of flies.

"Each year approximately 60,000 Canadians suffer some form of brain damage. A major effect of brain damage is to leave the individual motorically incapacitated in some way. One of the most serious forms of disability is the complete or partial loss of skilled use of a limb. Skilled movements include movements of reaching for objects, manipulating objects, and using the limb and hands for feeding. My research is directed toward understanding how skilled limb movements are produced and controlled. I am especially concerned with understanding how various regions of the brain contribute to skilled limb use. I am developing an animal model of skilled limb use which eventually will show how these movements evolved, how they develop as an individual matures, how they are controlled in the adult, and how they are modified during learning. I employ three approaches to the research. I study the evolution of limb use by examining limb use in different animal species. The results are mapped onto known phylogenies. I use anatomical procedures in order to understand the neural basis of skilled limb use. I use functional brain imaging procedures to identify functional neural correlates. These studies indicate how different regions of the brain contribute to skilled limb use and how undamaged portions of the brain substitute for damaged portions. This research also includes the development of therapies for brain injury.

"The objectives of the proposal are to develop theories, tools and techniques that facilitate the construction of 

systems which solve problems using Swarm Intelligence. In order to achieve an understanding of information processing in swarm-based systems, we propose that a new information field view be developed. This, we expect, to be based upon the investigator's own Ph.D. thesis, the work of Situated Cellular Agents of Bandini et al and extensions of our own work in understanding crowd dynamics based upon interacting information fields. As practical examples of the utility of the proposed theoretical formulation, we expect to apply swarm algorithms to problems in the area of robotic soccer and continue work in the understanding of crowds. Our focus in the former problem will be dynamic role assignment, while in the latter problem understanding how  information can be more effectively communicated within a crowd in order to effect, for example, more rapid 

egress from a building. We expect to use evolutionary algorithms, such as Genetic Programming, in order to 

develop agent behaviours for swarm-based robots in a manner similar to the SwarmBot project, which uses 

neural networks for robot behavior. In understanding sensor networks we expect to develop algorithms that 

ensure robust information gathering in scenarios where individual sensors fail; again, techniques from 

Evolutionary Computation are expected to be provide behaviours. As a further demonstration of the utility of 

swarm processing, we expect to solve problems in the area of Autonomic Computing. Here, we anticipate that 

autonomic managers -- agents by another name -- will learn to self organize to automate the management of 

next-generation computer systems.

"The North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered whales in the world, with a census population of about 350 individuals. I am testing the hypothesis that the low reproductive success of the species is due to the low genetic diversity at Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) loci. We have DNA profiles (35 microsatellite loci, the mitochondrial DNA control region sequence and gender - ZfX/ZfY) from 550 samples representing 390 individuals. This represents approximately 70% of the species and includes 150 mother calf pairs, of which 90 calves have been assigned paternity. A preliminary survey of exon 2 variation of the MHC DRï¿½-like gene with 169 samples identified 10 alleles using SSCP analysis, cloning and sequencing. Up to four alleles were present in each individual indicating a duplicated locus. By following inheritance patterns of known family groupings, six alleles were assigned to one locus (DRï¿½-1) and remaining four alleles were assigned to the second locus (DRï¿½-2). Haplotypes were assigned to 28 informative males with assigned paternities and the paternal contribution to the calf determined. We tested the hypothesis that fetuses with MHC haplotypes more like their mother would be more likely to be terminated. In twenty cases the calf received the paternal MHC haplotype that made it less like its mother and in 8 cases the haplotype that made it more like its mother. This transmission bias is highly significant, while the transmission of alleles from the neutral microsatellite loci was essentially Mendelian. This proposal is to characterise more class I and II loci in the MHC and develop haplotypes to increase the number of informative fathers. We presently have 62 fathers that are not informative and are profiling another 100 samples from the recent field seasons that should increase the paternities by at least 20. We will characterise MHC loci for which primers have been developed in other whale species and target homologous loci such as the human HLA-G locus that is directly involved immune tolerance during pregnancy. We will also look at MHC genotypes in mating groups to assess whether mating is random as predicted from the promiscuous sperm competition hypothesis for the species.

"Rocks record, to varying degrees, the structure, kinematics (movement history) and processes indicative of the deformation imposed by tectonic events.  This record of deformation is, in turn, central to the understanding of both the surface and interior dynamics of Earth and is a component of several areas of earth science research including structural geology, tectonics, geodynamics, mineral physics and neotectonics). The long-term objectives of this research program are three-fold: (1) to develop an understanding of the dynamics of earth deformation as seen in variations over time, and in space, of the record recorded in rocks (2) to determine the underlying causes of and responses to deformation; (3) to develop an internationally competitive research lab for the application of materials science techniques (nanogeology, transmission electron microscopy) to questions of the chemo-mechanical behaviour of rocks and minerals.  This process-oriented structural geology research has as an underlying goal the correlation of microscopic chemo-mechanical processes of rock deformation with the larger features produced by global tectonics. The research program utilizes an integrated field and laboratory approach to combine observations into the fullest possible description of Earth dynamics. Our ability to both describe and understand the origins of movements within Earth are an important step toward predicting both immediate and long-term linkages of tectonics to other aspects of the planetary system (e.g. earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, climatic influences, natural hazards).

"Mechanisms underlying the control of exercise ventilation remain an anomaly in human  physiology. Numerous hypotheses on the function of this control system are unable to fully explain the disproportionate increases in pulmonary ventilation relative to metabolic needs during intense exercise. We hypothesized that during exercise core temperature (Tc) is a significant influence on pulmonary ventilation.  Evidence supporting this novel view was from our demonstration of Tc thresholds for pulmonary ventilation in both passively (i.e. hot immersion at rest) and actively warmed (i.e. exercise) humans and proportional relationships between Tc and pulmonary ventilation during more pronounced hyperthermia.  This proportionality suggested a causal relationship that was supported by our further studies that indicated positive interactions between Tc and known modulators (i.e. arterial PCO2/pH & PO2) of pulmonary ventilation.  An emerging view became that elevated Tc stimulates ventilation and this is followed by a second phase or vestigial panting response when thermo- is prioritized over chemo-regulation. The objective of the proposed research is to further explore the nature and mechanisms underlying this hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation.  To attain this objective we will assess how modulators of ventilation and Tc interact in their influences on thermo- and chemo- regulation during hyperthermia.  A breath-by-breath end-tidal forcing  system  will be employed to allow clamping of partial pressures of end-tidal carbon dioxide and oxygen. The novelty and significance of this research will be to contribute to the resolution the long-standing anomaly of how and why humans hyperventilate heavy exercise.  Elucidating how modulators of ventilation and temperature interact in thermo- and chemo- regulation of will help broaden the understanding of the function of these two physiological control systems in humans.

The discovery of new pharmaceuticals is an important intellectual and commercial endeavour. In this application, funding is requested to advance the science behind fundamental biological and chemical processes. Objectives of the proposed research include the identification of new bacterial protein targets for antibiotic action, the chemical synthesis of enzyme inhibitors as potential antibiotics, and the characterization of the fundamental reactivity of negative ions in the gas phase. The latter will answer important questions in our understanding of processes used for the analysis of ions by mass spectrometry, the major tool used in drug metabolism studies during drug development. Our studies focus on amino acids, an important group of biomolecules that not only are incorporated into proteins, but also serve as integral components of the bacterial cell wall and act as neurotransmitters in mammals. In addition, amino acids are major sources of carbon, nitrogen and energy for anaerobic bacteria associated with periodontal disease, a disease that leads to degradation of gum tissue and increases the risk of coronary heart disease. The metabolism of amino acids in anaerobic bacteria differs from that in humans; our studies will further define these differences with the goal of developing effective and selective metabolic inhibitors that are potential antibiotics. Overall our research program in Bioorganic Chemistry will provide important insights into bacterial metabolism and mass spectrometry of biologically relevant molecules, yielding new mechanisms for the interpretation and application of fundamental processes.

"A unique problem that will directly affect how we interact with computer devices is upon us and quickly growing with the adoption of more powerful computing environments by the lay person. As the representation of information is rapidly changing from a two-dimensional (2D) representation to the ever more common three-dimensional (3D) representation the general population's lack of experience with 3D data and representation is creating interesting interaction and user interface issues.

The key area that we are concerned with is human understanding of representations of the human form itself in multimedia applications. As interaction with humans is something we are so accustomed to, it is clear that our ability to understand the human form in virtual worlds is likely to be one of the most impor-tant conditions necessary for said virtual worlds to be universally successful. The application possibilities of a human being able to understand and mimic a 3D representation they encounter in a virtual world or game environment are quite varied and include:

 - Games for Health and Active Play, Occupational Therapy

- Training systems for activities such as Yoga, Pilates, Karate and more

- Learning Cultural Dance and Customs, raining for Procedural Actions

- Entertainment Applications and Virtual World Interaction

Our proposed research aims at defining how 3D pose and orientation of the human form can best be represented in game and virtual environments in order to maximize understanding by the user/player. We believe such a framework for understanding a presentation of human form will be a valuable asset for fu-ture applications that use a 3D interface. The knowledge gathered from this study will help developers devise new and creative applications for personal sensor network technology that offer a more effective model for representation of form, interaction and interfaces accordingly.","Presentation of orientation and pose of the human form in interactive 3D systems","Computer software",CANADA,CANADA,"Information systems design"

"Human behaviour, and thus human populations, are largely shaped by culture: information or behaviour that individuals learn from one another. However there are other species, perhaps particularly among the whales and dolphins, for which culture is essential. The primary objective of my research is to understand the role of culture in whales. My principal study species is the sperm whale, a matrilineal, cosmopolitan animal of biological extremes. Female sperm whales are members of cultural clans which have tens of thousands of members, span thousands of kilometers, and, even when using the same waters, have characteristic vocal dialects and behavior. Clans are affected differently by El Nino, will be affected differently by global warming, and reproduce at different rates, all because they learn different behavior from other members of their clan. We use a 12m ocean going sailing boat, as well as whale-watch and other vessels, to study whale cultures. During a project in the Sea of Cortez, Mexico, we will measure the physical behavior and record the social sounds of social units of female sperm whales. We will then use a new statistical technique that I have developed to apportion the variability in this behavior to genetic, ecological and cultural causes, thus quantifying the influence of culture on behavior in this species. In an ongoing study in the West Indies, my students study behavior and vocalizations at the level of the individual sperm whale. We look at the diversity and development of individual behaviour and social sounds, describe social relationships between pairs of whales, and relate social relationships to kinship. Thus we look at the social roots of culture. A project off Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, carried out in conjunction with a local whale-watch operator, is designed to examine these same issues in another matrilineal whale species, the pilot whale, although this work is much less advanced. I will also use computer models to make theoretical predictions about how the social structure of a species influences extent to which culture affects behavior and the characteristics of that culture. My research tell us primarily about the nature of the whale, but also will help us understand why we humans are so supremely cultural.","Culture in whales","Wildlife management",CANADA,CANADA,Behaviour

The use of numerical modeling allows manufacturers not only to develop new product and reduce costs but also to shorten the product development cycle, essential to maintaining a competitive advantage in industries where success is critically dependant on technological innovation. As the Information Technology industry moves from predominantly stationary terminal devices (desktop pc's etc.) to a wireless enabled, mobile paradigm, the need for innovative, extremely small yet reliable storage will continue to expand. 



The proposed research will apply and develop numerical simulation techniques to model the behaviour and properties of magnetic multilayers. These materials constitute a key element in the development of future generation data storage media and sensors and the emerging field of spintronics. The proposed research will therefore advance the fundamental science critical to sustaining the rapid pace of development in thin (nano) film technology that has widespread industrial application.  Furthermore, it will also provide the training required to supply the personnel necessary to transfer to industry the knowledge and expertise in materials and device modeling that has been developed through the considerable investment of the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) in high performanace computing (HPC) at Canadian Universities.

"This research involves using lasers to study the atmospheres of Earth and Mars. The basic method is that the laser will emit pulses of light into the atmosphere and the backscattered light will be recorded as a function of time, or equivalently distance. Vertical profiles of laser backscatter are recorded sequentially in time and this provides a continuous view of the dust and cloud layers that drift past. This technique is called lidar, for light detection and ranging. The research program consists of four separate projects. The main project involves a lidar system on a spacecraft that will land on Mars. This is the Phoenix mission that will be launched in August 2007 and land in May 2008. The lidar will be used to investigate the atmospheric processes that determine the climate and movement of water within the Martian atmosphere. The other projects involve measurements from airplanes in the atmosphere of the Earth to observe the effects of thunderstorms. One of these projects concerns studying the role that tropical thunderstorms play in transporting water to very high altitudes and influencing the climate. Another project will investigate a different type of thunderstorm that forms above forest fires in the north of Canada and injects pollution into the stratosphere. The forth project is focused on thunderstorms in southern Ontario and the effect on local air quality and long range pollution transport.

"Earth's largest repositories of methane are  in marine and terrestrial gas hydrates and within/beneath permafrost layers. Although estimates are uncertain, marine gas hydrates store ca. 1.5 x10^15 m^3 and terrestrial hydrates up to 0.06-0.7 x10^15 m^3. Combined they double conventional gas resources of ca. 0.4 x10^15 m^3. Our biogeochemical research of marine hydrates offshore Oregon and Vancouver Is. Margins, and onshore Arctic Mallik 2L-38 hydrate well, documented the character, environmental and economic aspects of hydrates. In concert, we investigated the rapid methane changes at Preboreal /Younger  Dryas/Preboreal (YD/PB) transition and Late Glacial Maximum using methane stable C- and H-isotope  ratios in Greenland ice. Our ice research indicates that marine gas hydrates and tropical wetlands are not responsible for the Late Pleistocene methane changes. My hypothesis for the YD/PB rise is the release  of methane stored in near-surface permafrost soils. Warming causes permafrost layers in front of ice sheets to  thaw and release trapped methane. Today, we are experiencing a similar retreat in permafrost. If my YD/PB hypothesis is correct, then in the  coming decades we shall experience a similar rapid rise in atmospheric methane as the subArctic warms. This  may be combined with the release of methane from shelf gas hydrates. The implications are dramatic shifts in  present day global greenhouse gas budgets, impacts on current radiative budgets and influences on climate  change.  In my coming Discovery Grant period, I wish to intensely investigate the controls and rates of soil gas fluxes,  especially methane, from changing discontinuous permafrost regions and shelf hydrates of Canada's Arctic.  Using biogeochemical field measurements (including eddy flux correlation, gas composition, isotopes,  biomarker compounds, and microbiological assays) coupled with modeling, I seek to determine if  permafrost-and hydrate-derived methane: 1) is being influenced by changes in subArctic conditions, 2) is or can be released with sufficient quantity and isotope composition to be consistent with our YD/PB Canadian and Greenland ice signals, 3) will be of a magnitude that can significantly affect our future climate.

"A large proportion of matter consists of molecules that are either partially or completely chain-like, often with distinct components in each chain. They include polymers, which are relatively long chains, and phospholipids, which are relatively short ones. These molecules are very important, in systems as diverse as plastics and rubbers, cell-wall membranes, and drug-delivery systems.



The molecules can have complex structures, with different sections made of different species. These sections often repel one another, and interact differently with their environments. As a result, they can self-assemble into inhomogeneous structures whose sizes are on the order of nanometers. There can be subtle phase changes within these structures, induced by changes in such things as temperature, composition and pressure.



My research strives to understand and predict the equilibrium behaviour and nanoscale structures of these systems. The field is inherently interdisciplinary, at the interface of chemistry and physics, with an additional flavour of biophysics for some of it. The approach is computational, using a variety of computer-based theoretical techniques, but it includes careful experimental comparisons whenever possible. The overall goal is to understand the details of the phase behaviour and, most importantly, the reasons for these details.

"The diversity of life is organized into separate entities that we recognize as species.  Species are groups of populations that rarely or never interbreed with other such groups.  Barriers to interbreeding are important in nature because they allow closely related lineages to acquire distinct traits. My work focuses on understanding the causes and effects of barriers between species. In particular I am interested in those cases where new barriers have arisen that greatly reduce or prevent interbreeding between a derivative population and its progenitor.  The plant groups that I study are members of the sunflower family in which some populations have switched from sexual to asexual reproduction.  When this switch occurs, in addition to having dramatic consequences on a population's ability to generate genetic variation and adapt to changing conditions, asexuality serves as a reproductive barrier.  Different asexual clones are reproductively isolated from one another, as well as being isolated from their sexual counterparts. The research that I propose here aims to uncover the environmental conditions under which different asexual clones can grow.  Are they generalists that all tolerate roughly the same conditions equally well?  Or are they specialists, each able to tolerate a small slice of the environmental pie?  I am also interested in why two strategies, sexual and asexual, persist in nature.  Sexual populations, with their ability to generate variation, might be predicted to be able to outcompete asexuals.  On the other hand, if asexuality produces a highly successful clone, it may be able to spread quickly (because it won't require males, or pollen transfer) and outcompete sexuals.  It is also possible that the barrier to gene flow experienced by asexuals allows them to better match local environmental conditions.  A sexual population may be at a disadvantage if constantly faced with gene flow from populations better suited to different conditions.  In order to address these questions, I use descriptive approaches and genetic markers to understand the origin and reproductive dynamics of sexual and asexual populations, and I supplement these with experiments to test the fitness of different populations under a range of field and greenhouse conditions.

"Astrobiology is broadly defined as the scientific study of the origin, evolution, distribution, conditions and destiny of life in the universe. This new, transdisciplinary science is based on two scientific revolutions - the recent realization that microbial life is extremely hardy and can thrive in very harsh environments previously thought uninhabitable on Earth and the explosion of space technologies that are driving the robotic exploration of Mars and other planets in the search for life in our solar system. The Canadian Astrobiology Training Program (CATP) will create the first Canadian cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training program in Astrobiology, which by its very nature will be accomplished through collaborative and integrative research approaches containing elements of geology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, microbiology, and robotics. CATP trainees (~70 graduate & undergraduate students, PDFs over 6 years) will be exposed to innovative research and training approaches, combining fieldwork at unique Canadian analogue sites, including those in the high Arctic, with laboratory work at cutting edge analytical facilities at participating university, government, and industry partners. Shared expertise within and among institutions will be provided by means of course and seminar videoconferencing, and interdisciplinary supervision. Professional training will be enhanced by training rotations with our collaborators at CSA, MDA Space Missions, and our international partners, including NASA Ames. CATP HQP trained in various aspects of astrobiology will be at the forefront of the search for life beyond the Earth. Indeed, CATP will address the recognized lack of HQP in space science and lead to new scientific opportunities and promote Canadian participation in future missions to Mars with the ultimate goal of having Canadian scientists actively participating on such missions within 2-5 years as well as the Mars sample return mission in ~2018; both are direct initiatives of the 2008 CSA Exploration Roadmap. The skills acquired through this program will be directly transferable to various other disciplines, such as Earth and environmental sciences, robotics, medicine, and astronomy.

"The human adenoviruses are one of the many agents that cause the common cold. Despite their lack of

importance from a clinical perspective, these viruses have been used very successfully as models to study molecular biology. We are using this common cold virus as a probe to better understand how cell growth is regulated. When a virus replicates, it first infects a cell, then the genes of the virus are expressed and the virus begins to take over the cell. After the virus has gained control of the cell it begins to make many copies of itself and eventually kills the cell. In human adenovirus infection, a viral protein known as E1A is one of the viral proteins that take over the cell. We are studying this protein and using it to teach us about important control points in the cell, particularly those involved in regulating cell division.","Regulation of cellular and viral functions by the adenovirus E1A protein","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Cell division"

"Polymers are long, chain-like molecules that can occur naturally (e.g., DNA) or can be produced in the lab via synthetic techniques (e.g., polystyrene). The rubber and plastics in our everyday lives are made of polymers.  Block copolymers are produced by specialized synthetic techniques that chemically bond the end of one polymer species, or block (e.g., polystyrene) to a different polymer species (e.g., polyisoprene). The tendency for unlike blocks to repel would lead the system to separate into macroscopic domains of each species, if it weren't for the chemical bond between the blocks. The best the block copolymer can do is to separate its blocks into domain structures on a scale set by the size of the polymer, that is, tens of nanometers. The ability to spontaneously organize (self-assemble) into these microstructures make these materials potentially useful in applications requiring such resolution.  For example, there is an ongoing, world-wide effort to investigate the use of block copolymers as structural templates for lithography, and for the production of ordered arrays of metallic nano-dots and nano-wires. These templates hold the promise of shrinking microelectronic circuits to the 10 nm scale, below that accessible to traditional photolithography. One aspect of my research centres on understanding how confinement of a block copolymer into a cylindrical nanopore influences the self-assembly process and creates new microstructures. This may lead to potentially novel applications. When processing these materials it is also important to have a fundamental understanding of the time it takes the system to form these structures, that is, the kinetics of self-assembly. This is another research focus of my group. Key questions are: What is the relation between microstructure and dynamics? What are the kinetic pathways for, and barriers to, the formation of a given structure? How do we formulate a non-equilibrium theory to answer these questions? My group tackles these problems using a combination of sophisticated analytical methods and high-performance computing. This work is expected to result in major advances in our understanding of the dynamics of  block copolymers, and will enhance Canada's overall research effort in novel, soft-materials.","Theoretical study of block copolymer self-assembly","Polymers, rubber and plastics",CANADA,CANADA,"Soft condensed matter"
"The Mantle is essentially composed of anhydrous minerals (contain no water) but geological processes carry water down into the Mantle along subduction zone mainly in rocks called serpentinites.  Water can also have access to the Mantle along fracture systems that develop when Mantle rocks are obducted onto crustal rocks when tectonic plates collide.  I am studying a series of mantle and upper crustal rocks called an ophiolite complex that has been thrust up in Cornwall, UK.  These rocks have been studied before but no one has recognized the importance of a complex and extensive vein system in these rocks.  These fractures have allowed water into the heart of the ophiolite complex altering the rocks, filling the fractures with new minerals and lubricating the rocks so that they could be obducted to their present position.  The mineralogy of the veins reflects the falling temperature regime in which they form: high-temperature veins with feldspar, amphibole and clinochlore, medium-temperature veins with talc, clinochlore and serpentine and low-temperature veins with clinochlore, saponite and sepiolite.  Determining the mineralogy and the chemical composition of these vein minerals will allow me to determine the conditions they formed under and the source of the water. 

   Many of the minerals in these veins are serpentine minerals, hydrated magnesiun silicates.  The structure of these minerals are made up of two sheets of slightly different sizes and three solutions to this problem produces three structures: a cylindrical coiled structure, chrysotile, an alternating wave structure, antigorite and a planar structure, lizardite.  I will be determining how the bonds within these different structures relate to one another and to the many serpentine nanostructures that form, protoserpentine (poorly crystallized), conical chrysotile, cylindrical chrysotile (asbestos), polygonal serpentine tubes, polyhedral serpentine spheres, lizardite and antigorite crystals.  The serpentine nanostructures are similar to carbon nanostructures, but they are larger and easier to study so that the details of these structures may help solve problems in carbon nanostructures.

"My research activities will focus on two interrelated areas: galactic astronomy and the nature of dark matter.  Beautiful, majestic, and remarkably diverse, galaxies occupy a special place in astronomical lore.  While many galaxies appear to be isolated and quiescent, they are continually evolving, forming bars and spiral arms, swallowing up satellite galaxies, and merging with one another.  My collaborators, thesis students, and I are building idealized models of disk galaxies to study these complicated processes.  We fit observational data for actual galaxies by tuning the parameters of the model and study their evolution using numerical simulations.  We have built a suite of models for our galaxy, the Milky Way, and found that they develop bars and spiral structure similar to what is seen in nature.  In the future, we will incorporate gaseous disks and globular clusters into the model.  We will also study galaxy-galaxy interactions.



The most intriuging aspect of galaxies is that most of their mass is invisible and entirely different in form from the ordinary matter that makes up stars and planets.  This dark matter is distributed in an extended ""halo'' which surrounds the visible galaxy.  A major thrust of my research is to understand the nature of dark matter halos and to properly incorporate them into our galactic models.



While dark matter within galactic halos was originally thought to be smoothly distributed, simulations have revealed a wealth of halo substructure.  Recently, researchers have claimed that subhalos with masses as small as that of the Earth might exist in the Milky Way.  There is good reason to question this result; the standard tools used to study dark matter fail for objects this small.   R. Thacker (St. Marys), P. Elahi (PhD student at Queen's), and I are using novel theoretical techniques and high resolution simulations to address this very challenging problem.  The results may have important implications for dark matter search experiments.

"The proposed research focuses on the structural and functional dynamics of the cellular machinery that is responsible for the translation of genetic information into functional proteins, a process called translation. Translation takes place at the ribosome, a large macromolecular complex, which in a complex and precisely timed fashion interacts with several additional protein factors to achieve the fast and efficient protein synthesis observed in the living cell. To study the functional and structural dynamics of translation factors on the ribosomes; a purified in vitro translation system will be studied applying a multidisciplinary approach combining techniques ranging form classical biochemistry and fluorescence spectroscopy, to computational techniques such as molecular dynamics calculations. 

The detailed understanding of the dynamical properties and mechanisms inherent to the processes taking place in macromolecular assemblies are crucial for a wide variety of applications. The ribosome is a particularly relevant and interesting model system. It is the site of protein synthesis and the target for numerous antibiotics and rational drug design projects. Furthermore, the proposed program will strongly contribute to our understanding of the principles behind protein-RNA interactions as well as their folding and miss-folding. Understanding the dynamical properties in macromolecular assemblies will also have a strong impact on our knowledge of how protein and RNA functions together and will pave the road toward the development of macromolecular nanomachines setting the stage for biomolecular engineering.

"Our solar system contains the answers to some of our most fundamental questions. What is our origin? Could there be more of us (life) out there? Yet the current state of our solar system depends critically on the details of its as-yet-poorly understood formation process. This process occured 4.5 billion years ago but many clues remain, some in unlikely places. Fundamental to the question of origins are the small bodies of our solar system: asteroids, comets and meteoroids. The large bodies such as the Sun and planets are also important of course but have been subjected to substantial alteration over their lifetimes. Consider the Earth: the physical, chemical, geological and even biological processing it has undergone is tremendous. Smaller bodies, being geologically quiet, have remained largely unchanged since early times. Much key information that has been erased from the larger bodies remains ""fossilized'' in the smaller ones. 

     I propose to study the properties of these small bodies both observationally and by means of theory. The observational program will include  1) determining colours variations of asteroid families (collections of asteroids which arose from the break-up of a single larger parent body) to measure the effects of space weathering on their surfaces and learn about their composition 2) optical spectroscopic measurements of comets as part of a comparison of the make-ups of comets which formed in different parts of the solar system 3) on-going monitoring of asteroids which may be extinct comets 4) continued analysis of the large CFHT Legacy survey archive for colour and hence compositional information on the sub-km asteroids 5) high-resolution optical video astrometry and spectroscopy of meteors for the purpose of reliably linking individual meteors to their parents. On the theoretical side, my team will continue to investigate the dynamics of unusual resonant asteroids, important because they provide possible fixed benchmarks regarding early compositional variations across the solar system.

In Statistics, ""robustness"" refers to the ability of a procedure to retain its validity when the assumptions underlying its derivation are violated.  This notion is particularly important in experimental studies, where the experimenter may have only a vague knowledge of the structure of the response generating the data.

"The northern forests of Canada, known as the boreal region, is a vast area with a unique assemblage of biodiversity. Canada is home to a large proportion of the world's boreal forest, which supplies an important function for carbon storage, and is home to unique species as well as the breeding grounds for hundred of migrant songbirds. Increasingly, the boreal region is under threat from external stressors such as climate change, as well as more immediate threats due to resource development (logging, mining, hydroelectric development) and recreational use. Conservation of species and their associated habitats in the boreal requires an understanding of species ecology. This includes an understanding of their specific habitat requirements as well as an understanding of ecological processes such as predator-prey relationships. Protected areas can facilitate biodiversity conservation, but only when appropriately implemented. Research in landscape ecology that integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with conservation questions will contribute significantly to biodiversity conservation in the boreal region and to our understanding of spatial dynamics of ecological processes and species-habitat interactions. Such research will contribute to better design of protected areas in order to conserve boreal species and ecoystems over the long term in the face of environmental change.



The proposed research program investigates the effects of human activity on biodiveristy in the boreal region. It examines these issues at a large spatial scale, using principles from the field of Landscape Ecology, and tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), computer modelling, and field-work. It is anticipated that the proposed research will lead to a clearer understanding of species-habitat dynamics in order to better manage wildlife and to design protected areas that will be effective contributors to biodiversity conservation in the boreal region of Canada.

"The research relates to the clean, safe and efficient utilization of fuels, an area of high economic priority. The prime focus of the first project is to examine the complex interaction of the key factors that control the stability of non-premixed (diffusion) gaseous jet flames, especially at the extreme limit conditions of lift-off and blow-out and to gain improved understanding of flame stabilization mechanism near critical blowout conditions of both lifted and attached flames. An experimental investigation of the flow characteristics at the flame base using direct visualization and measurements by laser diagnostic techniques will be supplemented with CFD modeling incorporating detailed chemical kinetics. The prime objective is to enhance the stability range and efficiency of the combustion of wide range of gaseous fuels including those of low heating value such as biogases and coa-bed methane and at the same time reduce emissions.

The second project aims at the complete combustion of very lean fuel-air mixtures that include those below the lower flammability limit and also the partial oxidation of very rich mixtures through catalytic reaction. The former addresses the need for efficient utilization of fugitive gas and biogas releases in air and the latter provides for convenient approach to the production of hydrogen and synthesis gas in relatively small units primarily for use as fuel supplements in various combustion systems, e.g. engines. Both experimental and modeling approaches are to be employed.

"The objectives of this research program are:

1) To develop improved combinatorial algorithms for problems in Bioinformatics, particularly for structure prediction of biomolecules, building on the algorithms that have been developed in my lab so far

2) To extend jViz.Rna, a visualization tool for RNA secondary structure 



The algorithm RnaPredict, developed in my lab and based on evolutionary computation, has been demonstrated to predict certain known RNA secondary structures with very high accuracy (up to 90%) and to have a higher prediction accuracy on certain short and medium length sequences than mfold, the current benchmark for ab initio RNA secondary structure prediction. Particularly, RnaPredict is not as prone to predicting false positives as mfold is. Rnapredict uses a number of advanced operators and representations. I plan to further evaluate, improve, and extend RnaPredict. I have developed a visualization tool for RNA secondary structure which has a number of benefits over existing tools, including: wide support of input and output formats, ability to produce high quality graphics for reproduction, interactive output for further manipulation by the end user, ability to display pseudoknots in a classical structure plot, and the ability to overlay two different structures for comparison. jViz.Rna also produces quantitative and qualitative comparisons between two structures. The quantitative comparison is currently taking into account sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure. I plan to extend jViz.RNA to incorporate a comparison of structures based on common substructures using dual graphs.

"Geotechnical engineering research on three topics that are of global significance, with particular applicability to seismic design, mining, and pipeline engineering is proposed.  The focus is to undertake novel and leading-edge research that would advance the fundamental knowledge while addressing real-life needs.  

EARTHQUAKE RESPONSE OF SILTS: There is significant controversy regarding the current approaches to assess the earthquake response of fine-grained soils.  Evidence from recent earthquakes has also emphasized the need for understanding the response of natural silts.  With this background, laboratory research is proposed to study the mechanical response of silts.  The research will directly contribute to advancing the knowledge and improving design methods/guidelines in earthquake geotechnical engineering.

RESPONSE OF BURIED PIPELINES TO GROUND MOVEMENT: Polyethylene (PE) pipes are becoming increasingly popular in buried natural gas distribution systems, and the performance of these systems in areas subjected to ground deformations is an important engineering consideration.  Due to lack of fundamental knowledge, in the evaluation of PE piping, the current practice mainly relies on the methods developed for steel pipes, and this approach has significant limitations.  Research is proposed to understand the performance of buried PE pipelines under ground movements using full-scale model testing and numerical modeling.  The findings will provide input to developing guidelines for safe operation of PE gas pipeline systems.     )	

MECHANICAL RESPONSE OF MINE WASTE:  Mixing mine waste rock and tailings for disposal is a relatively new concept in mine waste management to prevent problems such as acid rock drainage and liquefaction.  Current understanding of the mechanical response of mine waste mixtures is very limited.

The natural environment contains smooth surfaces defined by edges that define where one object, or surface ends, and the other begins. Many experiments have shown that human visual system is adept interpolating such surfaces using a single cue to depth, stereopsis. However, stereopsis is also extremely useful in providing very precise estimates of relative depth between two regions. How does the visual system resolve the conflict between smoothing depth estimates across surfaces, and detecting the depth discontinuities between them? The hypothesis that is central to this proposal is that the brain uses unmatched elements along an object boundary to signal that an edge is present, and so define a discontinuity that cannot, or should not, be smoothed. 



Taken together, this series of experiments will form a foundation for understanding how precise identification of depth discontinuities co-exists with smoothing of extended surfaces.  This conceptual model is original, but consistent with existing literature on stereoscopic interpolation, stereoscopic transparency, and binocular half-occlusions. The integration of these areas of research will represent a significant advancement in our understanding of how humans perceive objects and surfaces in the natural environment.

"Animals and plants routinely face dilemmas. An animal, for instance, might have to choose between remaining committed to its present source of food (a ""sure thing"" so to speak) and leaving the food source in search of a richer one (possibly a ""gamble"").  Likewise, a plant might have to ""choose"" between using the energy it receives from the sun to produce seeds and using that same energy to grow taller.  Of course, each fork in the road has an effect on the evolutionary success of the imaginary animal or plant.  In some cases -- actually some of the most interesting cases -- decisions to stay or leave (grow or reproduce) have ripple effects, simultaneously altering the evolutionary success of a number of individuals nearby.  In biological terms, these dilemmas are said to have ""social consequences"" and so they are appropriately dubbed ""social dilemmas.""



Social dilemmas crop up everywhere. Understanding how these dilemmas are resolved has implications not only for ecology and animal behaviour science, but also for agriculture, the study of cancer, economics, politics, and even human resources management.  My research focuses on the social dilemmas that emerge as a consequence of sexuality, and those that are encountered in spatially or socially complex environments.  I ask questions like, ""How should a parent divide an investment of food or care between sons, on the one hand, and daughters on the other?"" and ""How 'nice' should an influential and 'well-connected' individual (or tumor cell) be?""  The answers to such questions can vary depending on the biological details we consider.  Unfortunately it is not always clear how some of the details that researchers consider relate to the ""Real World.""  My overall goal is to pinpoint the most important details and generate useful predictions that can be tested in laboratories and, later, in Real World settings.

"The objective of the proposed research is to complete the development and ex vivo testing of a multi-point pressure sensing system integrated into an angiographic guidewire.  This system will be used as a diagnostic tool to assist in therapeutic decisions for percutaneous coronary interventions such as balloon angioplasty and stents.  The system will consist of multiple pressure sensors deployed along the length of a single angiographic guide wire.  Individual sensors will be based on a common fibre-optic device, the in-fibre Bragg grating. In clinical use, patients will be catheterized by percutaneous femoral approach and the guide wire will be positioned such that the sensors span the target stenosis   This system will simultaneously measure dynamic pressures at multiple stations along the length of a stenotic region or, in the case of serial lesions, stenotic regions.  It will, therefore, provide physicians with much more detailed and accurate information about the severity of stenoses than existing pressure sensing technologies. Upon completion of this work, the system will be suitable for in vivo testing in an animal model.","A multi-point sensor to measure pressures across vascular stenoses","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical technology"

"For organisms to grow and develop they must continually increase the numbers of cells within them.  To achieve this cells can divide into two.  For the two resultant cells to survive they must have a complete complement of the organisms genetic material, otherwise they will die or become misregulated.  Therefore cell division must only occur once the genetic material has duplicated and separated, otherwise there would be an unequal distribution of the genetic material between the 2 newly forming cells.  We have evidence to suggest that the chromosomes in each cells contribute to spatially organizing a cell so that it will only divide to produce two cells with an equal genetic content.

"The proposed studies center on one of the most fundamental aspects of nervous system function, neuronal excitability. To ensure that information processing proceeds correctly, i.e., to maintain system's reliability, neurons need to maintain their excitability within certain operating ranges. Yet, over the course of their life time they face many influences that may perturb their excitability. While it is evident that overall most neurons are quite capable of keeping their response characteristics fairly constant until late in their existence, our understanding of how they accomplish this is limited. Recent evidence suggests that homeostatic regulatory mechanisms, i.e., negative feedback regulatory systems that use principles not unlike indoor temperature control systems, allow neurons to sense and regulate the desired level of their excitability by inserting or removing the membrane proteins that mediate this excitability. The long term goal of my ongoing research is to understand how these homeostatic mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of nervous system function in the aging.  In my work I use the pond snail Lymnaea, which I raise to very old age in my laboratory. The unique strength of this animal model system lies in its many individually identifiable nerve cells and functionally defined neuronal networks, which allow me directly link whole animal functional changes to alterations occurring at the molecular, cellular and network level. The specific objective of the proposed research program is to answer the question whether the decline in learning and memory performance arises from the actions of homeostatic mechanisms that constrain neuronal activity to protect increasingly vulnerable aging neurons and circuits against potentially fatal overuse. Using this powerful model system, the proposed research asks fundamental questions like: Why can some neurons retain their vitality during an entire life time whereas others of the same type, age and function become compromised? What is the secret of ""successful aging""?   These questions are of fundamental academic interest, yet the answers may aid in devising strategies to deal with one of the increasingly urgent problems of our society: the consequences of human aging.

"The research that my collaborators and I carry out is in the general area of computer vision, the attempt to endow machines with a sense of sight. From a theoretical point of view this is an important endeavor as it bears on fundamental issues in complex information processing, and may yield results that bear on our understanding of visual information processing in natural systems (e.g., humans), as well. From a practical point of view, machines that can see have the potential to interact with humans in a much more natural and useful fashion than is currently the case. The research encompassed in this particular proposal represents a collaborative effort between Canadian academia (York University) and industry (General Motors of Canada). It is concerned with rigorously characterizing the performance of video camera-based computer vision technology for estimation of relative 3D distance and direction to environmental objects from a moving vehicle. Distance and direction to environmental objects are required for collision avoidance, obstacle detection and parking. Analogous to the role of vision in human perception, video-based sensing in automobiles is anticipated to play a key role in the quest to build a human-like perception around vehicles; performance specification, as set forth in the current proposal, will be key to realizing this potential. This research contributes to Canada in three important ways. First, it will enable advanced automotive technology via incorporation of video-based sensing on next generation vehicles and thereby enhance the competitiveness of the Canadian automotive supply chain. Second, it more generally will advance the discipline of computer vision through rigorous performance evaluation of 3D distance and orientation estimation techniques and thereby pave the way for incorporation of such methods in vision machines; this allows Canada to compete successfully in a critical area of science and technology. Third, it provides students with hands on experience and skills in vital areas of investigation, computer vision and, more generally, computer science and engineering.

"Covalent DNA lesions play important roles in the treatment of cancer. Therapeutic alkylating agents, among some of the oldest anti-cancer agents, may be monofunctional or bifunctional; the latter category includes nitrogen mustards, chloroethyl-nitrosoureas and methyl methane sulfonates. These agents form interstrand cross-links, which if left unrepaired, prevent DNA strand separation and normal mitosis, interfere with transcription and induce apoptosis. A problem presented in cancer treatment is the development of resistance to the effects of these antitumor agents, often due to enhanced repair of the damage. Our group, through the synthesis and investigation of oligonucleotides that contain mimics of clinically relevant lesions formed during chemotherapy, hopes to advance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in their repair, an important step towards elucidating how some patients develop resistance to the effects of these chemotherapeutic agents.

"The program addresses mechanisms of host-parasite adaptation and especially genetic and environmental factors that contribute to observed variation in innate and immunologically specific host resistance mechanisms in outbred animals. The underlying objective is to identify regulatory mechanisms that control outcomes in immune response with a view to describing points of intervention through which to enhance health and productivity. To this point, the program has confirmed that the genetically controlled element of variation in immune response is heritable and allows breeding for enhanced immune response and growth. The environmental influence on variation in these traits is however much larger. The proposed research seeks to understand this component. Expected benefits include expanded knowledge of critical immune response functions that allow individuals to resist infection and allergic disease. The approach differs from many in that it uses outbred animals rather than the less realistic inbred laboratory rodents. For this reason, it is expected to be of greater possible relevance to domestic or feral animals and to humans. It is possible that novel preventative or therapeutic approaches may derive from these studies. Likely targets would be enhanced vaccination practices and improved husbandry, especially of neonates, with anticipated enhancement of resistance functions and / or reduced susceptibility to allergy.","Genetic and environmental regulators of immune response in pigs","Agriculture and primary food production",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal biology"
"The overall goal of my research is to determine how fishes produce and excrete metabolic wastes such as ammonia and urea, and how they cope with potentially toxic build-ups of these products.  Highly toxic ammonia arises from the breakdown of protein, and must be excreted or converted to less toxic products such as urea. Ammonia accumulates in fishes following feeding, but also when excretion via the gill is blocked by altered water chemistry (e.g. > pH) or elevated water ammonia arising from natural (e.g. decomposition of organic material) or anthropogenic sources (e.g. sewage and industrial effluent, agricultural run-off). In mammals, elevated ammonia results from liver disease, and can cause brain damage or death. Although ammonia targets the central nervous system (CNS), its mechanism of toxicity is unresolved. My long-term goal is to determine how build-ups of ammonia and other metabolic wastes adversely affect physiological processes in fishes. Much of my work will focus upon sea lampreys, who spend the first part of their life as filter-feeding larvae before metamorphosing into parasites that feed on the blood of fishes. My previous research demonstrated that feeding profoundly stimulated ammonia and urea excretion in parasitic lampreys as they fed on the blood of sharks and trout. Building upon this work, my OBJECTIVES for the next 5 years are to:

(i) Use simulated and actual feeding studies to determine how urea and other wastes are tolerated and excreted by lampreys after ingesting teleost blood or urea-rich shark blood, (ii) Identify the mechanisms of acute ammonia toxicity and tolerance in the CNS of ammonia-sensitive trout and ammonia-tolerant goldfish, and

(iii) Determine how prolonged sub-lethal ammonia exposure affects the fish CNS. The integrative approach I will use to complete this research will include whole animal models, cultured brain cells, molecular techniques, and electrophysiological methods.  Since lampreys represent the original jawless fishes, my work will answer fundamental questions on the mechanisms and evolution of waste excretion in vertebrates. Novel mechanisms of ammonia tolerance may also be identified that allow some fishes to withstand high levels of this neurotoxin.

"The convergence of multiple functions in portable electronic devices is resulting in greater power requirements

and the incumbent Li-ion battery is becoming limiting. Although existing batteries can accommodate the

current power demand, operating time remains a hurdle. The advancement of battery technology is not

projected to accommodate the increasing runtime gap. An attractive alternative is the direct methanol fuel cell

(DMFC). Liquid methanol is a sustainable electrochemical fuel that has a higher energy density than the Li-ion

battery (i.e. more energy per unit volume = longer operation). Additionally, it is easily handled, stored and

distributed through existing infrastructure. There is however certain technical barriers, such as fuel crossover,

poor kinetics, low efficiency and cost that limit the widespread adoption of conventional DMFCs. The novel

membraneless DMFC with simple power control addresses these issues through a simplified system design and

has demonstrated significant advantages over the conventional configuration.

The objective of the proposed project is to build a prototype battery recharger based on a membraneless DMFC

with a simple method of power control. The recharger prototype provides a tangible demonstration of a

potential early product incorporating the technology and is a key step in the commercialization pathway of the

technology. This will provide significant validation to the technical progress and commercial potential of the

technology, and aid immensely in the ability to attract early stage partners and funding for the further

development of the technology into a product.

It is well-recognized that the clean technology and clean energy sector are key economic opportunities for the

future. Canada has a leadership role in the fuel cell sector. The advancement of the novel membraneless

Integration of metal hydride hydrogen storage into the fuel cell; (3) Development of a processor for hydrogen

production, purification and compression. This involves the development of new advanced materials and new

approaches to hydrogen storage and processing. This technology addresses a number of the issues for

conventional solid oxide and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cels, and allows new approaches to fuel

Canada is one of the world leaders in the research and development of fuel cell and hydrogen technology, and is in an excellent position to exploit and benefit from this leadership.

   Fuel cells need to be competitive on an economic and product basis with established and highly developed combustion processes and other forms of power generation. Significant technical challenges still remain today in a number of areas including reliability, durability, cost, operational flexibility, technology simplification, fundamental understanding, and life cycle impact.

"Engineering materials are intrinsically complex.  They contain a range of phases and/or voids distributed throughout the structure, and the properties of a material are largely determined by how these phases interact.  Despite this complexity it is possible, through careful experiment and the development of microstructurally based modeling, to understand the fundamental processes that control material behaviour.  I have therefore proposed a range of topics that address fundamental issues related to the role that microstructural complexity plays in controlling the thermal and mechanical properties.  Four projects are proposed.  In the first, the fundamental nature of damage coalescence leading to ductile fracture will be assessed using model materials coupled with x-ray tomographic imaging at synchrotron sources.  The samples for these experiments are made by drilling holes in thin sheets of metal using a femtosecond laser system and then diffusion bonding these sheets to form bulk metals with embedded holes.  A second project will address the effect of this laser processing on surface microstructure and properties.  In particular we will address the nano-grained structure that we have found along the surface of holes drilled into metals such as copper and aluminum.  The other two projects deal with high temperature behaviour of materials.  In one, we will study the relationship between creep deformation and oxide scale formation, looking especially at FeAlCr intermetallics.  From previous studies on other materials we expect that compressive creep will significantly accelerate the growth of the oxide.  This study is aimed at validating models we have developed in recent years.  The final project concerns the creep of ceramic matrices reinforced with refractory fibres - whether SiC whiskers or carbon nanotubes.  A model for this process is being developed which will guide experiments.  The aim is to address the role that a percolative network of fibres plays in enhancing creep resistance.

"This research program uses a combination of psychophysical and functional imaging techniques to examine intermediate levels of visual processing in the ventral visual pathway of the brain, the pathway responsible for object recognition.  Part of the proposed work addresses basic theoretical issues concerning the way information about shape is encoded in the visual system (e.g. that an apple is round, while a pear is elongated) and how that shape code is combined with other cues to object identity (e.g., apples are often shiny and red, while pears are more likely to be matte brown).  My work uses both abstract patterns and familiar objects including human faces, and fruits and vegetables.  I want to learn how categories of objects are differentiated from one another in the brain and whether faces form a unique category treated differently from other objects, as some have suggested.   This proposal goes beyond these basic questions to look at two problems with immediate practical significance.  Firstly, how do we recognize the age of a face? What are the cues in a face that tell us how old the person is, and which of these cues are we best at detecting?  If we can understand this, it will provide a basis for improving algorithms for predicting how a face will age over a period of years (important in missing persons and criminal investigations).  Secondly, how do our higher level visual abilities change as we get older?  We know that some aspects of vision may deteriorate with age due to changes at the level of the eyeball; however, we know less about whether there are changes in the way visual parts of the brain process spatial and temporal aspects of the constantly changing visual scene.  Understanding this has importance in both designing supportive environments for the elderly, and for assessing competencies such as driving ability.","Behavioural and imaging studies of face and object perception",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Sensory systems -- visual"

"It is becoming increasingly common in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to collect patient-level cost data along with the measures of effectiveness (health effects).  This added dimension to RCTs has motivated the development of new statistical methodology designed to answer questions of health policy in addition to those of purely clinical importance.  Initially attention was focussed on estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.  More recently, due to the acknowledged problems associated with ratio statistics, attention has shifted to making inference about incremental net benefit (INB), using test of hypothesis and confidence intervals.  An advantage of expressing the results of a cost-effectiveness analysis of an RCT in terms of INB is that it allows the use of decision analysis for interpreting the results.  Faced with positive, but uncertain, INB, the clinical decision maker must choose to adopt the new intervention now or delay the decision while another trial is performed.  Value of information methods based on decision analysis can be used to determine which choice is optimal, and if another trial is to be performed, the optimal sample size.

    )	In recent articles my colleagues and I have proposed replacing tests of hypotheses and power arguments for the interpretation and design of RCTs, which we consider arbitrary, with methods based on a Bayesian decision theoretic approach which determine the sample size that maximizes the difference between expected cost of the trial and the expected value of information it provides. The research proposed centres on further developing value of information methods for interpreting RCT results and determining optimal designs for future RCTs.  In particular, the following topics will be covered.

"Ordinary algebra studies the laws of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of ordinary numbers.  Branches of modern algebra study certain ""nonstandard"" systems of algebra which arise in various contexts.  A simple example is Boolean algebra, which is the system of laws modeled by the boolean operators AND, OR, XOR, and NOT as they act on the two boolean truth values 0 (""false"") and 1 (""true"").  Much more complicated systems of algebra, most of them bizarre, some of them useful in physics, chemistry, theoretical computer science and engineering, can be invented, studied, and modeled.  Universal algebra is the general study of patterns in, and the limits of, nonstandard laws of algebra and their models.  



The research for which I am seeking funding aims to make progress towards resolving deep theoretical conjectures framed in the language of universal algebra.  The first is the ""Constraint Satisfaction Problem Dichotomy Conjecture"" in theoretical computer science.  A large class of computational problems, including problems arising from machine reasoning, scheduling and database theory, can be formulated in a precise framework known as a ""constraint satisfaction problem"" or CSP.  The CSP Dichotomy Conjecture postulates that each CSP is either computationally tractable or impossibly hard; refinements of the conjecture guess the location of the line dividing the former kind from the latter.  My proposed research will help prove that large classes of CSPs are tractable.



The second and third conjectures that I will study arise within the ""pure"" theory of universal algebra.  Helping resolve these conjectures will extend mathematicians' knowledge of general nonstandard algebraic systems, which in turn may prove to be useful in unpredicted future applications.

"Association formation contributes to the survival and fitness of both humans and nonhumans. It refers to the learning of relationships about different features of the environment when they occur closely together in either time or space. When an infant learns to discriminate the end of one word from the beginning of another word, or when an animal learns to reject a particular food because it is associated with past illness, an inter-event connection has been formed. Our research is directed at revealing the conditions under which associations are formed in order to create precise mathematical models of the processes involved. Past experiments from many laboratories, including our own, suggest that association formation is a complex process which does not always produce a result consistent with the actual statistical association between the events in question. We study these departures from statistical normality in conditioning experiments with rats and in timing and categorization tasks with human volunteers. Our research has shown that, under special circumstances, some events may become strong associates despite the relatively weak statistical relationship between them. These observations have encouraged the development of neuron-like mathematical accounts of the associative learning process, called error-correction theories. Further tests of the predictions of these models should reveal new phenomenon and lead to the development of even better theoretical accounts.

"What prevents animals, including humans, from producing as many offspring of the highest quality as they like? Evolutionary biology provides the answer that there is a 'cost' to reproduction wherein the benefits of increased investment in a current reproductive bout are offset by costs in terms of current condition, future fecundity and survival. In birds, considerable evidence from studies where investment in egg production has been experimentally-manipulated supports this concept. However, one area of knowledge where we still have only a very rudimentary understanding is with regard to the causal mechanism(s) underlying costs of reproduction. Historically, it has been assumed that the cost of reproduction is energy or nutrient-dependent and that it involves a relatively simple resource-allocation mechanism where resources required for reproduction are reallocated away from other physiological functions (e.g. immune function) which in turn have negative effects. More recently it has been suggested that costs of reproduction might instead be caused by reproduction itself or the regulatory (physiological) mechanisms underlying reproduction. This project will investigate two ideas related to this: a) that anemia associated with egg production decreases the aerobic or exercise performance of females, and b) that reproduction increases susceptibility to oxidative stress (""cellular damage"") and that this links sex and death. Our approach is experimental and integrates evolutionary biology, ecology and physiology. For example, we will use drugs to increase or decrease the level of anemia in laying birds and then directly test effects on flight performance, breeding success, and offspring growth. This project will provide novel, comprehensive data on causal mechanisms underlying costs of reproduction. Furthermore, although this work might seem esoteric through the application of physiological approaches our work will provide novel insight into key questions concerning effects of environmental variation (climate change) on avian populations (e.g. Mediterranean blue tit populations and Arctic-nesting eider ducks), including species of conservation and management concern (e.g. marbled murrelets).","Regulatory mechanisms and cost of reproduction","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Evolution and ecology"

"Materials properties can often change drastically with variations in temperature, and understanding these changes is crucial to many applications.  Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a widely used technique that probes changes in the transfer of heat into and out of a material as a function of temperature.  This, in turn, makes it possible to detect phase transitions (e.g. melting points) with a high degree of accuracy, and to obtain considerable detail regarding how ordered or disordered a material is at different temperatures.  This technique is also sensitive to chemical reactions, which are invariably accompanied by heat being absorbed or released.  Researchers at SFU will employ this instrumentation to probe the ordering a wide variety of materials, including liquid crystals, fuel cells, photovoltaic materials (i.e. solar cells), drug-release platforms and biological cell membranes.","Differential scanning calorimeter","Materials sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Materials structure, properties and testing"

"Although researchers are generally agreed that the source of the metals and sulphur in porphyry and epithermal mineral deposits is a felsic magma, and that the medium of metal transport is an aqueous fluid of magmatic origin, the concentration of this fluid in the magma, its composition, including the concentration of volatile species that transport metals, its nature (liquid or vapour) and the timing of its exsolution are poorly known. Silicate glass inclusions, which are trapped at depth in minerals forming during the crystallization of the magma, provide an ideal source of information for answering these questions. From the perspective of volcanology, such inclusions also provide essential information on the nature and composition of the exsolving volatile species (H2O, CO2, SO2) that control the rate of magma ascent and the style and intensity of eruptions. In order, however, to be able to properly interpret the controls on the exsolution of these volatiles, and more specifically, their partitioning between the silicate melt and the aqueous fluid, experiments are required at known pressure and temperature conditions for magmas of known composition. Research designed to address these issues is being conducted at McGill University and Simon Fraser University and depends heavily on the ability to be able to analyse the volatile composition of silicate glass. Historically, the preferred means of obtaining such data was secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). However, recent developments in micro-FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) spectroscopy make the latter a very attractive, inexpensive and superior means of obtaining such data. This proposal is a joint initiative of the applicant and co-applicants, who are collaborating in several projects requiring a capability for volatile analysis of silicate glasses. The application requests funds to obtain a micro-FTIR spectrometer and infrared microscope for this purpose, which will be housed at McGill University. The equipment will be used to support the research of the applicant and co-applicants and that of 13 graduate students and two post-doctoral fellows.

"Stabilizing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will be one of mankind's greatest challenges during the next few decades. This will require curbing emissions as well as CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Several CCS routes have been proposed, but it is generally accepted that CO2 mineralization is the most durable and safest option. This is the process of carbonate mineral formation that occurs during the weathering of rocks, and is fastest with orthosilicate minerals such as olivine. Although olivine-bearing rocks (e.g., peridotites) are exposed occasionally at the Earth's surface and their natural carbonation is well-understood, a self-propagating, artificially-induced carbonation process has not been established, and rates of reaction between CO2 and rock have been studied only for limited conditions. The challenge for industry, presented through CO2 cap-and-trade policies, will be to develop technology to safely dispose of CO2. The steel industry, which is responsible for ~7% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, has limited options for reducing its CO2 output and will certainly

need CCS technology to fulfill its obligations. Fortunately, by-products of steelmaking have been recognized as potential materials for CO2 mineralization. Converter slag and olivine-bearing rocks represent analogous systems for reactions with CO2-H2O fluids. Both involve orthosilicates (larnite [Ca2SiO4], in the case of slag) in a reduced system dominated by divalent iron. This proposal aims at locating optimal conditions for CO2-mineralization of Ca/Mg orthosilicates by extending the hitherto studied range to those of supercritical CO2-H2O mixtures. The project will focus on the nature and kinetics of orthosilicate dissolution and carbonate mineral deposition, the key steps in the CO2 mineralization process, and will employ a flow-through tube reactor, to overcome some of the drawbacks of the batch-, and stirred-tank reactors used in previous studies. It will quantify CO2 uptake rates in terms of fluid composition, flow rate and pressure/temperature. If successful,

results of the project will form the basis for designs of CO2 sequestration technology for in-situ carbonation of peridotite bodies, as well as ex-situ carbonation of industrial by-products such as slags.","An experimental study of rates of Ca/Mg orthosilicate dissolution and carbonation in supercritical H2O-CO2 fluids","Climate and atmosphere",CANADA,CANADA,"Environmental geology"
"High sulphidation epithermal deposits are an important source of gold that has been receiving increased attention since discovery of the giant Yanacocha deposit (Peru) in the mid-1980s with a resource of >50 million oz. gold. However, in comparison to their relatives, low sulphidation epithermal and porphyry copper deposits, high sulphidation epithermal gold deposits are poorly understood. As mining companies are become increasingly dependent on genetic models to guide their exploration strategies, there is greater need to improve our understanding of ore-forming processes. Although there is agreement that these deposits form within volcanic edifices and that condensed magmatic vapours are responsible for ground preparation, there is much less agreement on the nature of the ore fluids, the manner in which the gold is dissolved, and the timing of mineralisation. In many cases, there is evidence for late introduction of gold and for these deposits, researchers have variously proposed that the ore fluid is of magmatic origin, meteoric liquid that absorbed magmatic vapour, or magmatic vapour that contracted to liquid without passing through the two-phase region; both bisulphide and chloride complexes have been invoked as agents of gold transport. However, in some cases, there is evidence that ground preparation and gold mineralisation were pene-contemporaneous, implying that gold was transported by vapour, possibly as a hydrated chloride or sulphide species. This proposal is for a comparative study of a pair of high sulphidation deposits (Bowone-Binebase, Indonesia) in which gold mineralisation appears to have been early (associated with pyritisation), and an active volcano (Kawah Ijen, Indonesia) which shows evidence of high sulphidation alteration, including pyritisation. The objective of the research is to develop a genetic model by characterising petrographically and geochemically the mineralisation and alteration, reconstructing the physicochemical conditions of ore formation, determining the composition of Kawah Ijen fluids, and experimentally investigating their gold transporting capacity. If successful, the project will help refine existing models for high sulphidation mineralisation and strategies for its exploration.

"Sharply increased global energy consumption, due in part to the booming economies of China and India, coupled with high oil prices and concerns about global warming, have encouraged many countries to turn their attention to nuclear energy. As a result, the price of uranium (as U3O8) has risen from 10 US$/lb in January 2003, to ~60 US$/lb in June 2008, and types of uranium deposits that were previously uneconomic are now the focus of intense exploration activity. One of these deposit types is leucogranite (pegmatitic)-hosted uranium mineralization exemplified by the giant Rï¿½ssing mine in Namibia. These deposits are thought to form as a result of the melting of clastic metasedimentary rocks pre-enriched in uranium. However, the conditions under which uranium is incorporated in these melts and the controls of its subsequent crystallization as uraninite are poorly known. There is evidence that the uraninite mineralization is in part hydrothermal, but there is only poor understanding of the factors that control the transport and deposition of this uranium. Furthermore the relative importance of magmatic and hydrothermal processes in concentrating the uranium to economic levels have not been evaluated. This proposal is for a comparative study of newly discovered leucogranite-hosted uranium prospects in the George River domain of northern Quï¿½bec-Labrador with the Rï¿½ssing deposit. The objective of the study is to develop a comprehensive genetic model for the George River uranium prospects and contribute new understanding of the genesis of the Rï¿½ssing deposit. In order to do this, we propose to evaluate the petrochemistry of the leucogranites, establish the uranium mineral paragenesis, evaluate the hydrothermal alteration and its relationship to uranium mineralization, determine the fluid chemistry (for both George River and Rï¿½ssing), investigate uranium solubility/speciation in aqueous fluids experimentally, and reconstruct the physicochemical conditions of uranium mineralization at the magmatic and hydrothermal stages. This study will help guide exploration for leucogranite-hosted uranium mineralization, and could lead to the development of significant uranium resources in a potentially important new metallogenic province in northern Canada.

"A variety of technological advances ranging from improvements in automobile catalytic converters to the development of more powerful lasers, and the discovery of new supermagnetic materials are creating a strong demand for yttrium (Y) and heavy rare earth elements (HREE).  Currently, these metals are supplied mainly as byproducts of the mining of less sought after carbonatite-hosted light REE from China.  Consequently, instead of the HREE supply being determined by demand, it is determined by that of LREE.  There is thus considerable impetus to discover independent resources of Y and HREE.  The focus of this study is the Thor Lake Y-HREE deposit, NWT, which if brought into production, would be the only operating REE mine in North America, and would have reserves sufficient to meet the continent's demand for Y and HREE for the foreseeable future.  Deposits of Y and HREE are hosted primarily by reduced peralkaline intrusions.  However, there is little agreement over why Y and HREE concentrate in these intrusions, why there is a preference for the HREE, and whether the deposits are purely magmatic or partly the product of hydrothermal processes.  The Thor Lake deposit is characterized by intense hydrothermal alteration involving Na, Fe K and Si metasomatism, and is thus ideal for investigating the possible role of hydrothermal processes in concentrating Y and HREE.  The objective of the proposed research is to evaluate hydrothermal Y and HREE enrichment and develop a comprehensive genetic model for the deposit.  In order to do this, we propose to establish the rare metal mineral paragenesis and its relationship to alteration using optical/SEM microscopy, identify the protolith to the altered rocks and the potential source of metals using whole rock geochemistry, geochronology and melt inclusions, determine the composition and origin of the hydrothermal fluids using fluid inclusion and isotopic analyses, and evaluate the Y-HREE transport capacity of the fluids through experiments and thermodynamic calculations.  The results of the study will shed new light on the origin of a poorly understood class of deposits and identify new guidelines for their exploration in Canada and abroad.

"Although vein-type mesothermal/orogenic deposits host the bulk of the gold mined in Archean terrains, large tonnage, disseminated gold mineralization exploitable by open pit methods represents a potentially important resource that has been largely overlooked. This proposal seeks funds for a project that aims to develop understanding of the genesis of this type of mineralization using as a case study Canadian Malartic, a very large (>170 million tons), low grade gold deposit which is currently being explored by Osisko Exploration Limited. As this deposit is partly hosted by a porphyritic intrusion, it is attractive to speculate that Canadian Malartic is a unusual example of an Archean porphyry deposit and, indeed, this is the model on which Osisko is basing its exploration. However, these deposits are rare and many have subsequently been shown to lack essential characteristics of porphyry deposits.  Another possibility is that Canadian Malartic represents an example of the still poorly understood intrusion-related class of deposits that has been described in Phanerozoic and Proterozoic settings. Finally, Canadian Malartic may be an unusual variant of the more typical mesothermal/orogenic class of deposits.  In order to develop a well-constrained genetic model for the Canadian Malartic deposit, it will be necessary to establish: 1) the composition of the porphyry; 2) the nature and distribution of alteration/mineralization; 3) the timing of mineralization relative to magmatism, deformation and metamorphism; 4) the composition of the mineralizing fluids and their relationship to magmatism; 5) the physicochemical conditions; and 6) the effects of various changes in the hydrothermal system on the solubility of gold.  We propose a multifaceted approach to meet these objectives, involving whole rock geochemistry, petrography, geochronology, alteration studies, ore mineralogy, fluid inclusion and isotopic studies, and thermodynamic modelling.  Based on this model, the project will help identify vectors that can be used to enhance the efficiency of exploration for this type of deposit within the Canadian Malartic area, as well as elsewhere in the Abitibi region and other Archean terrains.

"Although considerable progress has been made in characterising volcanic eruptions, a more complete understanding of the physical processes responsible for volcanic activity requires the integration of multi-temporal and multi-spatial geophysical and geochemical studies. The intrusion of fresh, gas-rich magma into a reservoir is thought to be essential to the occurrence of an eruption and to cause the latter by interacting with the ponded magma. However, the extent of this interaction and rate at which it occurs are still poorly understood. The main objective of my research is therefore to gather multi-temporal geochemical and geophysical data aimed at determining the depth and physical properties of magma chambers and associated hydrothermal systems as well as investigate conduit processes beneath persistently active volcanoes and calderas in a state of unrest. I will use these data to develop integrated models relating ground deformation and gravity variations to changes in the volume and volatile composition of a magma reservoir. A problem in studies of this type is that changes in the upper edifice of active volcanoes (e.g., hydrothermal systems) can ""mask"" changes occurring at depth. I will therefore try to constrain the spatiotemporal influence of these near-surface effects by conducting complementary studies of volcanic systems. I will continue collecting time series data at persistently active volcanoes by monitoring gas emissions, geodetic and passive geoelectrical responses at Masaya (Nicaragua), Poï¿½s (Costa Rica), and Kawah Ijen (Indonesia) and will initiate similar multi-parameter studies at Kilauea volcano (USA). I will continue to integrate ground-based geochemical and geophysical measurements which allow for characterization of the near-surface processes involved in persistent volcanism and therefore enable better modeling of the deeper magmatic processes that are likely responsible for triggering eruptions. The proposed research has the potential to significantly advance understanding of how volcanic systems develop from a state of dormancy through unrest into a state of persistent activity and finally to one of eruption.","4D multi-parameter investigaitons of volcanic eruption processes","Earth sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Earth science (see also marine geology 4604)"

"Wireless network technology continues to advance at a phenomenal pace. Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) such as WiFi are now widely deployed, and have become a vital part of our networked information infrastructure, providing users flexible and ubiquitous wireless Internet access.



Despite the prevalent deployment and use of WLAN technologies, wireless networks are not without performance problems. These problems arise because of multi-layer interactions between Internet protocols and the characteristics of wireless network environments (e.g., mobility, transient connectivity, time-varying channel conditions). Many of these protocol performance issues will pervade new wireless technologies too.



The general objectives of the proposed research program are to identify protocol performance problems in broadband wireless networks, and to propose and evaluate innovative solutions to these performance problems. These objectives will guide the research exploration across a range of wireless technologies, including WiFi, WiMax, ad hoc, wireless mesh, and hybrid wireless/cellular network technologies.



The research will use a combination of experimental, simulation, and analytical approaches. Empirical measurement and experimental evaluation will be a mainstay in the research, using the facilities provided by the Wireless Internet Performance Laboratory at the University of Calgary.

"It is a well known fact that the major cost in modern hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) is incurred in developing and managing the energy storage system and on-board power generation. An effective way to economise HEV operation is to design an optimally efficient electric drive train. Keeping this fact in mind, the major goals of this project are two-fold. The first goal is to model the noteworthy DC/AC traction inverter and motor losses (efficiencies) over typical city and highway driving schedules. A brush-less DC (BLDC) motor will be modeled and designed for propulsion. This leads to the subsequent key target of the proposed project, which includes the design and implementation of a novel hybrid control strategy, in order to maximize the electric drive train efficiency.

The groundwork calculations and estimated electric drive train efficiencies, summarized in the first part of the project, form a solid basis for development work in the area of HEV system-level control. Based on this knowledge, a novel control strategy will be designed, the principal objective of which would be to eventually maximize the efficiency of the electric propulsion system. The HEV control strategy will essentially use the motor for fulfilling vehicular power demands and maintaining a specific charge within the batteries. The core challenge would be to find the most optimal operating region (from the speed-torque operating data) that governs maximum motor efficiency. Some of the critical control parameters could include, battery state-of-charge (SOC), all-electric driving capability, and the optimal hybridization factor (HF). Therefore, the key experiment would be to investigate the best possible combination of various control variables, in order to maximize system efficiency.

In summary, the in-depth efficiency modeling and design implementation proposed in this project, based on the development of a novel HEV control strategy, will support the escalation of maximum efficiency levels of electric drive trains for future advanced vehicle applications.

"All organisms must balance energy intake against output on some timescale to survive and reproduce. Therefore, factors affecting energy balance will exert strong influence on evolution and, indeed, all ecological processes. The long-term goal of my program is to understand variation in mechanisms used by small, free-living mammals to maintain energy balance in the face of environmental change. This is important for understanding the evolution of physiological traits, and predicting consequences of climate change for wildlife and ecosystems. In the short-term, my group will focus on variability in two related sets of mechanisms: a) traits associated with whole-animal energy expenditure, such as metabolic rate and thermoregulation; and b) activity of the so-called ""stress axis"", which helps mediate predictable seasonal changes in energy use, and responses to acute environmental stressors (such as predation risk) via stress hormones. We will test hypotheses about responses of these traits to environmental change in long-lived mammals with low reproductive rates (bats, Chiroptera) vs. short-lived species with high reproductive rates (shrews, Soricidae) to assess the influence of life history on physiological variation. Theory predicts that long-lived species should be more flexible in response to environmental change because of selection pressure favouring adaptation to the broad range of conditions experienced during their lives. Individuals of short-lived species should be less flexible but these species may be subject to more rapid evolutionary change because of shorter generation times. We will study whole-animal metabolism by measuring rates of O2 consumption, CO2 production and body temperature in wild-captured animals, and stress axis activity by assaying stress hormones in blood or feces. Over the long-term we will test the hypothesis that inter-annual variation in these traits, within populations of bats and shrews, is correlated with both direct and indirect effects of climate change.

"Clusters of galaxies are equivalent to the towns and cities in which individual galaxies live and grow. My research is based upon finding new galaxy clusters and studying the galaxies they contain. I achieve this using space borne X-ray observatories - named ""Newton"" and ""Chandra"" - which capture images of the hot clouds of gas associated with galaxy clusters. The heat contained in the X-ray gas is a clue to how massive the galaxy cluster is - like a mass ""label"" - it is similar to reading the label on a sweater and working out how big it will be. I then use a wide variety of telescopes - in the optical and infrared, from ground and space - to study the ""life history"" of each galaxy in each cluster. What results is a huge map of changing galaxy properties (big-small, old-young) each attached to a galaxy cluster, and each cluster with a label telling us how massive it is. To achieve this, my graduate students and I are working with a large, international team of astronomers; just like the national census tells us abouts trends in our nation, this ""galaxy census"" tells us about how the universe came to look like it does today.

"How cells ""sense"" a change in ambient oxygen has long been a central question in biology. Increases (hyperoxia) or decreases (hypoxia) of oxygen in the cellular milieu impose a ""stress"" upon cells to which they must respond. Adaptation to changes in oxygen concentration in a cell's environment involves the initiation of gene and protein expression. The mechanism of control of these processes is dependent upon oxygen-dependent modification of protein structure and function. The proposed research supported by this NSERC Discovery Grant will lead to progress in two general areas. The first will uncover novel proteins in cultured mammalian cells that are subject to oxygen-dependent posttranslational modification. The second will be to further characterize the role of these proteins in cellular survival of oxygen stress. The focus will be on adaptation to hypoxic conditions. All organisms encounter changes in ambient oxygen to a greater or lesser extent. In humans, adaptation to high altitudes and ischemia (cessation of blood flow to organs and tissues, such as during cardiac arrest, stroke or organ transplant) requires the ability to respond to hypoxia.



   The proposed research will focus on a specific oxygen-dependent modification of proteins known as hydroxylation. Hydroxylation is carried out by specific enzymes known as hydroxylases. The removal of oxygen prevents protein hydroxylation and can stabilize proteins subject to this modification. Such proteins may have enhanced function (or may only function) under hypoxic conditions. A proteomic approach has been utilized to reveal new protein substrates of hydroxylases. Identified proteins will be characterized for altered function under hypoxia with both in vivo and in vitro studies. The role of novel hydroxylated proteins to the overall survival of cells to hypoxia will be assessed by gene knockdown. Results will ultimately contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms by which organisms adapt to low oxygen conditions.","Role of protein hydoxylation in cellular response to hypoxia 67493","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,Biochemistry

"Historically, waste management engineers have collected very little information about their municipal solid waste collection operations. The installation of global positioning system (GPS) data recorders and other automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems on solid waste collection vehicles has changed that situation significantly. In 2003, the applicant began working with the City of Hamilton to collect AVL data from five different waste collection vehicles operating on a variety of different collection routes. This work has demonstrated several practical uses for the collected data, but it is also clear that much more can be done with this rich data source. The purpose of the proposed research is to assist municipal solid waste managers with both their day-to-day operational decisions and their long-term planning needs by developing decision support tools for managing solid waste collection operations. The specific objectives of this research are:

1.     to analyze fundamental spatial data on the movements and operations of a number of solid waste collection vehicles in a variety of different collection schemes using a geographic information system (GIS);

2.     to relate those data to other data sets such as census information and weigh-scale records;

3.     to develop an integrated set of modeling tools for analyzing municipal solid waste collection systems; 

4.     to apply those tools to a range of different waste collection operations with a view to improving the efficiency and reducing the cost and environmental impact of waste collection operations;

5.     to communicate the results of the research to waste management engineers; and

6.     to train graduate students in systems engineering methods and municipal solid waste management.

This research is expected to result in more efficient and less costly waste collection operations. Specifically, this research should help to minimize the size of waste collection truck fleets and the amount of time required to collect municipal solid wastes. The end result will be lower capital and operating costs, lower fuel consumption, and reduced air emissions from waste collection vehicles.

"Nearby galaxies provide astronomers with the opportunity to study the interplay between the interstellar medium and star formation in a wider range of environments than can be accessed in our own Galaxy. Galaxy mass, star formation rate, morphology, metallicity, and their larger scale environment may all have an impact on the physical and chemical properties of the interstellar medium. Nearby galaxies also play an important role in allowing astronomers to probe the relationship between global galactic properties and interactions on parsec to kiloparsec scales. Understanding how local processes affect the global appearance of galaxies is crucial to a physical interpretation of more distant galaxies in the early universe, for which only globally-averaged quantities can be measured.



I will carry out a program of far-infrared and submillimeter-wave radio observations to study the earliest phases of massive star formation across a range of galactic environments from quiescent spiral disks to high luminosity merging galaxies. Some specific aims are (1) to use measurements of the physical and dynamical properties of the dense molecular gas in galaxy mergers in combination with numerical models to understand how the interaction triggers an intense burst of star formation; (2) to measure the physical properties of the dense gas and dust in normal galaxies as a function of galaxy type, metallicity, star formation rate, mass, and environment with the ultimate goal of determining how star formation is regulated in galaxies; and (3) to obtain accurate measures of the pre-stellar clump mass function, both for low and high mass stars, which will provide a critical constraint on numerical models of star formation in our own Galaxy.

"Our lives involve a constant stream of perceptual information.  In parallel with this cascade of sensory information, we are constantly preparing and executing responses.  To successfully complete tasks, we need to select the task-relevant perceptual information and the task-appropriate responses.  Furthermore, we need to retrieve task-relevant memories to facilitate our perceptual and response processes.  



The focus of my research is to understand how control processes influence our perceptions, memories, and responses.  The general approach is to conceive of a task as consisting of three components: (1) selection and perceptual processing of the task-relevant stimulus, (2) retrieval of task-relevant memories, and (3) preparation and execution of the required response.  By combining functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging with behavioural techniques and by comparing control mechanisms underlying perception, memory, and response systems, my long-term goal is to develop a comprehensive model of cognitive control.  Such a model is expected to benefit control research by linking traditionally distinct domains of perception, memory, and response.



An ability to control perceptions, memories, and responses is critical to behavioural success.  This can be seen by the cognitive control difficulties experienced by people diagnosed as attention-deficit, obsessive-compulsive, schizophrenic, and autistic.  An improved understanding of control mechanisms is essential for devising treatment for those with control deficiencies.  An understanding of cognitive control also has implications for non-clinical populations.  The modern, computerized Canadian workplace places high demands on our cognitive systems.  It is important to understand the extent to which overloading of this system leads to degradation in task performance.

"The objective of this work is to develop new methods for simulating physiological mechanics in cadaver hips and for measuring movement and force distribution in those joints. The rationale for this work is that mechanical factors are thought to underlie the development of hip osteoarthritis, a prevalent and disabling

disease, but it is not clear what mechanical changes lead to hip osteoarthritis or how to correct them surgically. This is because biomechanical studies of the hip to date have been limited by the simulations of joint mechanics and by the methods available for measuring joint movement and force distribution.

     We will develop a loading simulator for applying physiological loading to cadaver hip joints. The novelty of this simulator is that the full range of hip movements will be simulated, in contrast with many previous designs that have simulated only a static standing posture. The simulator will hold the pelvis securely and will

use electromechanical actuators to apply forces to the distal tendons of the major muscle groups of the hip, which will move the femur through its primary ranges of movement and load the joint. 

      Movement of the joint will be measured using a three dimensional optoelectronic measurement system.  We will also develop new sensors to quantify force distribution at the hip joint. The novelty of this approach is that we will develop sensors for continuous measurements of force distribution, which has been difficult to achieve in the hip joint. We will assess existing force distribution sensors, networks of fibre Bragg gratings, and instrumented screws to hold simulated deformities in place as potential options. We will validate these technologies in test-retest assessments of repeatability in cadaver hip specimens and by comparing measurements to reference standards.  Once these systems have been developed and applied, we will apply them to study the biomechanics of the natural hip.

"Virtually all biochemical reactions occur through multiple steps with 'transient intermediates' along the way. These transient intermediates play a crucial role in the biological activity of proteins and may represent a vast untapped pool of potential drug targets. The trouble is, transient intermediates are often so short-lived that they are often difficult to detect directly, let alone characterize in detail. Research in my group focuses on the development of new tools for studying transient protein intermediates. We do this by combining microfluidics for rapid, precise liquid handling and the analytical power of electrospray mass spectrometry. Our overriding objective is to enable complex, structure based studies on transient protein intermediates leading ultimately to i) better understanding of transient species and their role in biology and ii) identification of new targets for drug therapy.

"Synthetic compounds and natural substances that are released into domestic wastewater can mimic endogenous hormones, and can potentially affect human health and aquatic organisms. A complex array of pharmaceuticals and personal care products have been found in wastewater effluent. The recent detection of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in surface and ground waters has raised concern about the potential ecological and human health impacts from exposure to low levels of these substances. Conventional sewage treatment does not effectively remove compounds such as pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals have been designed for inherent biological activity and we expect that they may be biologically active in many species, including fish. This research is focused on documenting the presence and removal rates of non-traditional contaminants from wastewater. We will be determining the processes that are effective for removal of pharmaceuticals from

wastewater and which pharmaceuticals remain under current treatment. Exposures of zebrafish to wastewater effluent and individual model pharmaceuticals commonly found in wastewater effluent, will identify what impacts we might expect in fish species in receiving waters, including impacts on reproduction. The wastewater treatment plant that these studies will be focused on will undergo major upgrades that include promising new technologies for removal of pharmaceuticals. These studies will provide us with data and generate methods such that we will be able to assess whether new wastewater treatments will provide improvements in removal of pharmaceuticals and reduce environmental impacts of wastewater effluent.","Pharmaceuticals in wastewater effluent and their environmental impacts","Waste, waste management and recycling",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal reproduction"

"Our research focuses on how Hepatitis C virus replicates in human cells.  Because viruses are obligate intracellular parasites they must avoid cellular defense mechanisms and take over basic cellular operations in order to grow.  Thus studying how viruses replicate often reveals novel cellular processes.  We are interested in how the replication of HCV is influenced by host cell RNA interference (RNAi) activity.  Andrew Fire and Craig Mello first discovered RNAi in 1998 and were recently awarded a Nobel Prize for their work.  In plants, RNAi is an important antiviral defense mechanism in which single stranded viral genomic RNA is targeted for destruction by the presence of double stranded viral RNA intermediates.  In mammalian cells RNAi works quite differently.  Naturally occurring short double stranded RNAs, called microRNA activate similar machinery, but instead of targeting viral RNA for destruction they inhibit messenger RNA from being used for protein synthesis.  We are interested in the influence of RNA interference activity on the human virus Hepatitis C.  We disabled RNAi activity in cells and were surprised to find that virus replication decreased.  This suggested that instead of limiting virus replication as it does in plants, RNAi activity appears to benefit the replication of HCV.  Subsequent evidence suggests that this RNAi activity may be novel since it does not resemble other RNAi functions.  Our research program is designed to further our knowledge of this undefined cellular regulation mechanism and determine how HCV, a model virus of the Flaviviridae family of single stranded viruses uses this system for its own benefit.  In particular we will study the biochemical interactions between HCV and RNAi related proteins, and to find genetic links between HCV and RNA interference activity.   These studies will further our knowledge of cell regulation and virus replication and may reveal links between virus replication and pathogenesis.

"Complete skeletons of fossil fishes found in exceptional fossil deposits yield a wealth of information. In my lab we focus on these deposits to learn about the origins, relationships, mode of life, and anatomical features of species that lived during Silurian and Early Devonian time (400 to 430 million years ago), when early vertebrates with jaws and their jawless relatives were abundant and diverse. These exceptional fossil deposits are in the Mackenzie Mountains, N.W.T. and other parts of northern Canada.

    One locality contains at least 60 species of early vertebrates, including jawless forms and early jawed vertebrates related to sharks and bony fishes. Most are complete skeletons. Some of them allow us to examine growth of the skeleton. Others tell us about the evolution of body features such as paired fins, teeth, ears, and guts. These studies involve careful comparisons with fossils found elsewhere in the world and use modern computerized methods of reconstructing the tree of life.

    An Eocene (50 million years old) locality contains thousands of specimens of fishes preserved in annual layers of lake sediment. A new approach pioneered by a graduate student from North Dakota reveals growth rates of fishes calculated from fossil scales and vertebrae. Through a postdoctoral fellowship in my lab, we will apply this method to excellent collections from the Eocene locality to learn how growth rates responded to climate changes over centuries and millennia. We will extend these methods to other fossil deposits, learning how growth rates of fishes changed during long-term climate change.

    Study of extraordinary deposits shows us more about extinct vertebrates than study of fragments of fossils. The results can then be extended to less favorable situations. Dating of rocks by fragments of fossils and tracing of faunal changes over time will be more reliable when the fossil species and their biology are better known. Fish scales and vertebrae teach us about the biology of ancient species and can lead to predictions about responses of living species during climate change.

"The listing of boreal caribou as a threatened species under the federal Species at Risk Act (2007) and equivalent provincial legislation has obligated industry to demonstrate that their current and proposed land use activities will not impact the long-term viability of the species. It has also forced the federal and appropriate provincial and territorial governments to develop a recovery strategy for the species. In order to support this work, we propose to further develop a Genetic-Habitat toolkit to provide Manitoba Hydro a suite of applications ranging from the immediate establishment of baseline data, population and demographic genetic structure to characterize herds on the landscape and connectivity among herds; to longer-term assessments (i.e. population size estimates) and multi-year monitoring of impacts resulting from development (i.e. changes to dispersal patterns, demographic herd signatures, connectivity and kinship). These applications will supply Manitoba Hydro with options for generating comprehensive results through the different phases of planning, specifically:  routing and construction of new transmission lines, the generation of new facilities; and in monitoring impacts of existing facilities. Applying this toolkit will ultimately provide early warning of potential problems associated with anthropogenic activities along with options for mitigating these impacts. This work will be achieved through a partnership of relevant stakeholders, specifically industry (Manitoba Hydro), the provincial (Manitoba Conservation) and federal (Parks Canada) governments and academia (Trent University and the University of Manitoba).","Landscape genetics of boreal caribou using non-invasive fecal samples","Wildlife management",CANADA,CANADA,"Population genetics"
"We are currently in a period of global warming that is having dramatic effects on species distributions worldwide. Geographic expansions of northern range boundaries are occurring for many species, while the range margins at their southern peripheral distribution are impacted by less suitable habitat and increased isolation resulting from anthropogenic activities and increased biotic stress. These distributional changes will have profound effects on biodiversity and ecological processes and require a detailed understanding of the causes and consequences of range shifts at the population level. This project will study flying squirrels (Glaucomys sp.) that have undergone an important ""natural experiment"" in Ontario.  Southern flying squirrels expanded their range by approximately 200 km over a 10-year period, however, in 2003-04, the combined effects of a cold winter and low food caused the population to contract by an equivalent distance in one year.  This project will survey any surviving southern flying squirrel populations or hybrid northern x southern flyers that may have been adapted to the acute local climatic event. Candidate adaptive genes potentially involved in thermoregulation that promoted local adaptation to the colder winter at the range front or in any surviving pockets will be characterized.  We will also examine the synergistic effects of warming trends and habitat fragmentation on flying squirrels as they expand through the developed Ontario landscape.  It will be important over the next few decades to increase our understanding the combined effects of climatic warming and increasingly random harsh weather conditions, such as the 2003-04 Ontario winter, on range expansions and local adaptation in wildlife populations.

"Breathing is perhaps the most vital, robust and rhythmic behavior in mammals yet key questions regarding the nature of the rhythmogenic neuronal circuit that generates the breathing rhythm remain largely unresolved. These include: (a) How extensive is the rhythmogenic circuit? (b) Can it be reduced to a number of discrete, but interacting neuronal oscillators?  And (c) how did the circuit evolve?  Motivated by (a) the fact that breathing is quintessential to human health and well-being, (b) the need for greater knowledge about central control of breathing in non-mammalian species and (c) the fact that a comparative approach has been instrumental in illuminating neuronal mechanisms underlying the physiology of other systems, the proposed experiments focus on neuronal control of breathing in lower vertebrates and address the evolution of the rhythmogenic circuit.



Recent data suggest that the breathing rhythms in fish, frog and mammals is generated by pairs of neuronal clocks, or oscillators, located within the brainstem. This raises the possibility that one or both of the breathing oscillators in mammals first arose in an ancient air-breathing fish, 400 million years ago.



The overall aim of this proposal is to test this possibility and expand our understanding of respiratory rhythmogenesis in lower vertebrates by:

(1) Using a novel ""sheep-dip"" technique to quickly identify and determine the pharmacological properties of functionally important rhythmogenic regions within the isolated brainstems of frogs and other lower vertebrates, and

"Our lab uses field experiments to examine the role of belowground biotic interactions in controlling the distribution and diversity of plant species along environmental gradients. We have two main model systems: the invasion of native grassland by woody plants, and the invasion of grassland by non-native grasses.



One focus is the seasonality of productivity. Data based on leaf phenology suggests that climate warming will have large effects on productivity. 80-90% of productivity in temperate vegetation, however, is belowground. Thus the reliability of using leaf data to predict whole-system phenology is unknown. We predict that the correlation between root and shoot phenology increases significantly with decreasing productivity, and will test this at large spatial scales (southern vs northern Saskatchewan) using one species, aspen, and along a compact arctic alpine gradient with high turnover of growth forms.



Another focus is the impact of aboveground herbivory on belowground productivity and carbon sequestration. We will examine the impact of aboveground herbivores and seed predators on the species composition, diversity and belowground function of grasslands in field experiments arrayed across southern Saskatchewan.



Lastly, we will continue to explore the extent to which contrasting species influence ecosystem processes. This has implications for soil fertility and carbon storage, and is relevant because management (forestry, ranching, restoration) and climate change are driving strong changes in species composition.

"In this project, we will investigate methods of improving the scalability of computer-aided design tools that map circuits to Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  Field-Programmable Gate Arrays provide a low-risk, low-cost implementation path for a wide variety of digital circuits.  To map circuits to these devices, engineers employ a suite of compilation tools.  These tools require significant computing resources, especially when mapping circuits to state-of-the-art FPGAs.  As the capacity of FPGAs grow, the problem will become even more severe.  Unless the scalability of FPGA CAD tools is addressed, the long run times and large memory footprints will become a hindrance to future FPGA scaling, leading to increased costs and design times for companies which use these devices.  



This work will benefit the research and industrial communities in two ways.  First, the techniques themselves may be useful for FPGA vendors and CAD tool developers as they create algorithms that map circuits to future devices.  These devices will be larger than those that exist today, and a technique for controlling the growth in memory requirements will be essential.  Our techniques will be demonstrated in a routing tool that is very representative of those tools used in industry, meaning that our techniques will be applicable as industry adopts our ideas in their tools.



Second, we will make an implementation of our ideas publicly available to other researchers.  We will incorporate our ideas into a popular academic router, which is already used by researchers world-wide.  This will enable researchers to investigate programmable logic architectures that are much larger than what they can currently study.  In the long term, this will lead to innovations that will further accelerate the development of FPGA technology.

"The RTI funding requested here will go to support geologically directed microbial evolution experiments aimed at addressing an apparent contradiction that underlies studies of life on early Earth.  That is, how can studies of life on early Earth rely on ancient microbes to metabolize exactly like modern microbes when it is known that microbes can evolve on laboratory timescales?  Specifically, we are asking for support for an ultra-low temperature freezer in which a culture archive of the experiments will be maintained.  This 'fossil' record will be available for reanimation at any time during the experiment, enabling us to directly compete ancestral microbial populations against their descendants.  The equipment supported under this RTI award will be part of a host of research projects, ranging from PhD-level experiments to short-term undergraduate research experiences.  In particular, it will become a centerpiece in the McGill Stable Isotope Laboratory's training program for post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate trainees under the NSERC Collaborative Research and Training Experience Canadian Astrobiology Training Program.

"The broad objective of the proposed research program is to track 'electrons through time' using cutting-edge measurements of total sulfur and oxygen isotopes. Redox transformations, and the associated flow of electrons, link the co-evolution of the solid earth and its fluid envelope. The global biota mediate most of these transformations, enabling the redox trajectory of the earth surface environment to be interpreted as a record of biotic evolution. In the stable isotope laboratory of McGill University's Earth and Planetary Sciences department, we use laboratory experiments and studies of well-constrained modern environments to calibrate sulfur and oxygen isotopic tracers of paleoredox changes. Once calibrated, these tracers are then applied to well-characterized sample sets from the rock record. The focus of upcoming work, for example, will range from biogeochemical cycling in modern methane hydrates to piston-cylinder investigations on magmatic degassing. A common theme will be the extraction of sulfur and oxygen fractionation factors that characterize material cycling in these environments. Concurrent with laboratory investigations, field studies will span the full range of Earth history, from the recent products of volcanic eruptions to some of the oldest rocks of Earth (the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt). Successful completion of this work will provide a double benefit to the field of Earth System Science. First, the calibration of isotopic tracers for redox transformations will provide a

direct, albeit uniformitarian, way to interpret the biogeochemical cycling in ancient earth surface environments. Second, field studies will provide a ground-truth for the calibration results, likely leading to novel demonstrations of ancient biogeochemical processes as well as inspiring new calibration efforts.","Isotopic interconnections in the earth system","Earth sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Earth-systems science"

"Ecosystems are considered to be open systems composed of inter-related heterogeneous subunits. These subunits contain food webs that vary in time and whose trophic interactions provide the pathways of energy and matter from lower trophic levels to consumers and predators. At the same time environmental spatial complexity and interconnectivity via active and passive transport processes (e.g., dispersion of organisms, energy transport through resources) are now recognized to alter population and community dynamics and ultimately maintain biological diversity. This research program aims to understand the control of secondary (zooplankton) productivity by considering the degree of trophic connectivity among spatially discrete habitats of the estuarine landscape and how such exchanges vary on a seasonal scale. A number of interrelated short-term goals will be addressed, focussing on particular aspects of tropho-dynamics and habitat connectivity in the estuarine transition zone of St Lawrence Estuary: (1) Seasonal succession of zooplankton assemblages in habitats arrayed along (e.g., salinity) and across (shoal vs. deep habitats) the estuary at different times of the year will be determined. (2) Secondary production by focussing on trophic linkages within species assemblages of various habitat types will be determined. (3) Potential subsidies and the degree of trophic coupling among habitats will be quantified, focussing on a subset of species that play a major role in energy transfer. (4) Rates and strength of trophic linkages will be measured using in situ and laboratory experiments. (5) In the longer term, we aim to develop a coupled biological-physical model to estimate the relative importance of in situ local production and subsidy transport among habitats to overall estuarine secondary production. This research proposes two main projects, one focussing on overall zooplankton production, grazing and predation of zooplankton in the heterogeneous space of the estuarine transition zone. The second one focuses on temporal and spatial variability, its causes and importance of relationships between dominant copepods and intermediate sized predators (mysids) to overall secondary productivity.","Zooplankton trophodynamics and spatial patterns in estuarine transition zones",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Evolution and ecology"

"Over recent years there have been numerous discoveries in the area, of materials fabrication on the nanoscale. Researchers now believe that inspiring functionality can be built into systems made by organizing many molecular building blocks into one unit. The most advanced properties of such assemblies include their ability to repair themselves or adapt to changing conditions. If we are to bring such technology to the public domain. the next challenge is to learn how to process such systems effectively on larger scales. In the present work. we will examine this opportunity using two approaches. Firstly, we will address the processing issue by designing and fabricating tiny silicon chips that use a technique called microfluidics to enable chemical synthesis of nanoscale building blocks to be controlled and run continuously, providing a stream of products.

"My research is concerned with the relationship between brain function and cognition with an emphasis on the hippocampus, a structure within the medial temporal lobe, and its role in learning and memory.  Specific experiments focus on the effects of lesions to the hippocampus on anterograde and retrograde memory, as measured by various laboratory tests. As well, I am investigating the functional significance of neurogenesis, the process of new cell growth, which occurs primarily, if not exclusively, in the hippocampus. At the theoretical level, we have developed a model of memory formation and representation which attempts to explain the dynamic relationship between the hippocampus and extra-hippocampal structures in mediating different types of memory.  The proposal is that memories, when they are initially formed, are detailed, context-specific and represented in the hippocampus.  An important feature of the model is that these episodic memories are represented in the hippocampus over the long-term, and for as long as they exist. Over time, generalities from these memories are abstracted and integrated with pre-existing knowledge to form semantic (schematic) memories in brain (neocortical) regions outside the hippocampus. In this way, episodic memories, which are context-specific and hippocampus-dependent are transformed into context-general and hippocampus-independent memories which capture only the 'gist' of the original experience but are capable of supporting retrieval of essential information.  Potentially, both types of memory can co-exist so that, in principle, a normal individual could recall the episodic or semantic version of an experience. However, if the hippocampus is damaged, episodic memories are unavailable and only the generic form can be recalled.","Learning and memory changes associated with brain impairment","Health, education and social services",CANADA,CANADA,"Life sciences research related to human health and disease"

"Impulsivity is both a beneficial and detrimental human characteristic, allowing us to seize a valuable opportunity or to make a disastrous decision we live to regret.  A high level of impulsivity is a key symptom in psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD).  Improving our understanding of the biological basis of impulsivity could provide valuable insight into the nature of these illnesses.  Recent evidence suggests that the neurotransmitter noradrenaline may be important in the regulation of impulsivity, and novel drugs which modulate the activity of this system may offer alternatives to stimulant medication for AD/HD.  Increases in noradrenergic activity have also been shown to trigger mania in bipolar patients.  We have recently found that the drug yohimbine, which increases noradrenaline levels in the brain, also increases impulsive responding in rats.  We intend to determine which noradrenergic receptors in which brain regions are responsible for effecting this change in impulsive behaviour.  We wish to use this knowledge, together with what is known regarding the effects of other pharmacological agents active at different neurotransmitter systems, in order to understand how drugs which alter impulse control may converge on similar intracellular signaling pathways.  Such information could generate a ""molecular footprint"" for impulsivity, linking behaviour to molecular biology, which could in time open up new avenues for therapeutic treatment for impulse control disorders.

For example, every user of such a program wants to be sure that secret data (credit card number, pin, etc.) are not accessible to unauthorized persons. Another example might be software controlling a nuclear plant. It is desirable that such a program does not fail. One method for developing reliable software products is program verification, i.e. providing a mathematical proof of correctness versus a given specification. For the reasons mentioned above a certification of a software product following the European ITSEC (Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria) at level E4-E6 - the three highest certification/assurance levels of that standard - requires the application of formal methods including correctness proofs of at least parts of the system.

      The existing tools and methods are very limited in providing mechanisms to transfer properties, their proofs and proof methods from one construction to another. One is forced to start on a very basic level, which generates a huge amount of proof obligations. In real world examples proving all obligations is often not feasible or at least too expensive. A system and its underlying methodology, which allows less expensive development of verified programs would be of great benefit for software developers and finally for all users. My objective is to establish such a system and methodology, and, thus, to transfer theoretical results to real world applications.

      The overwhelming success of object-oriented programming languages is based on reuse of software components. I will apply the same idea to the corresponding proof system. Properties of programs and their proof will be integrated into the class hierarchy such that a suitable inheritance mechanism transfers operations as well as the related properties and proofs to subclasses.

"Mammalian memory is an intricate and complex cognitive process involving the integration of disparate types of information. The research proposal emphasizes the hierarchical and distributed nature of declarative memory (memory for facts and events) in the brain. Rats will be used to study the neurobiological underpinnings of various aspects of declarative memory, including how different types of information processed in different brain regions are integrated to form complex memories. A primary interest of the proposed research is the neural basis of object recognition memory. This behavioural task will be used to study the anatomical, pharmacological, and molecular bases of declarative memory acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval. Moreover, variations on the basic object recognition task will be used to introduce increasing levels of complexity to facilitate the study of information integration in the service of higher-order declarative memories. This approach has the potential to provide great insight into not only the 'building blocks' of declarative memory, but also the progressive decline of memory in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, in which rather specific memory deficits (e.g., failing to recognize objects such as faces) expand into a much more marked global amnesia affecting all aspects of autobiographical and factual memory.

"Cells that make up fat, bone cartilage and muscle, can be generated from a single stem cell called a mesenchymal stem cell.  Research has shown that vitamin A can prevent to formation of new fat cells and can help produce more bone cells.  We have shown that vitamin A can act, at a molecular level, through a protein called C/EBPbeta.  C/EBPbeta's role is to use DNA to make new proteins required to convert stem cells into mature bone or fat cells.  We have discovered that another protein, Smad3, is expressed at higher levels in stem cells treated with vitamin A, and we believe this protein is involved in preventing C/EBPbeta from interacting with DNA, something it needs to do to be active.  This proposal aims to understand how vitamin A blocks fat cell formation and enhances bone cell production through Smad3 interference with C/EBPbeta activity.  We will (1) assess Smad3 interference of C/EBPbeta activity during fat cell and bone cell formation; (2) Characterize how Smad3 and C/EBPbeta interact in the cell and finally (3) identify new genes that are regulated by this process.  The results of this work will help us better understand how vitamin A controls cell functions and how mesenchymal stem cell maturation is regulated - in essence providing invaluable information about how fat and bone cells are formed in the body.","The control of C/EBPbeta DNA-binding affinity by retinoic acid and Smad3 during mesenchymal stem cell differentiation","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Gene expression"

"Mathematics is the study of patterns.

The most fundamental and elementary type of pattern is a symmetry. There are finite `groups' of symmetries, such as the group consisting of the 48 distinct symmetries of a cube, and there are also infinite groups of symmetries such as the group of symmetries of the tiling of the Euclidean plane by squares. While finite groups of symmetries can be understood quite well, some infinite groups are so complex that they are provably impossible to understand. Nevertheless, many important problems in geometry and topology can be boiled down to understanding the infinite group of symmetries of some infinite geometric object. This research aims to understand certain infinite groups using geometric and topological reasoning. The work involves a beautiful interplay between algebra, geometry, and topology, which will shed light on all three disciplines.

"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful analytical techniques available for characterizing chemical compounds.  It is routinely used in academic and industrial labs around the world to help chemists identify the molecules they have made or isolated.  Specifically, NMR is a spectroscopic technique that allows scientists to detect radio frequencies that are emitted when atoms are exposed to very strong magnetic fields.  Just as different AM or FM radio stations transmit their broadcast signals at different frequencies, different types of atoms will emit their radio waves at specific frequencies too.  These characteristic ""broadcast"" frequencies are called chemical shifts.  Chemical shifts are often used by NMR spectroscopists as specific markers to identify the type of atom in a given chemical compound.  It has been known for a long time that chemical shifts can also provide information about the type, location. local geometry and even the motion of atoms relative to other atoms in a molecule.  However, deciphering this information from raw chemical shift data is quite difficult, especially for large molecules such as peptides and proteins. Recently, my laboratory has made some exciting progress in ""decoding"" the structural and dynamic information that can be measured from protein chemical shifts.  We want to extend this work and to see if we can apply this knowledge to more rapidly and accurately determine the 3D structure and dynamics of proteins using only chemical shift information. With conventional methods, it typically takes very skilled NMR spectroscopists more than six months of painstaking, manually intensive work to assign, generate and refine a protein structure.  We believe that our new, chemical shift-based approach could potentially shorten this time from six months to as little as six minutes.  This novel approach could also open up the possibility of characterizing proteins and protein complexes that are too difficult or too large to study by conventional NMR.  Such an improvement in speed and accuracy could have profound implications in the application of NMR to biology, chemistry and pharmaceutical research.

My research is in the area of universal or general algebra, the branch of mathematics which studies the structure of objects from algebra and theoretical computer science. In universal algebra, properties of classical algebraic structures such as groups, rings and fields are abstracted and generalized, to give a common structure of operations on sets of objects, subject to various rules or identities. An algebra, therefore, is a set of objects, with some collection of operations on the objects; and an identity of the algebra is a rule or equation satisfied by all the objects in the set. I study the structure of such algebras and identities. I also study new structures called co-algebras, which can be used to model finite-state machines in theoretical computer science.

"Saline lakes are found on all continents and account for almost half of the total volume of inland surface standing water on Earth. Saline lakes are also a common feature across the Canadian prairies, and current climate models predict that prairies will get drier, which should result in further increasing salinities. The effects of salinity on aquatic communities are species-specific and depend on the capability of an organism to cope with increasing osmotic stress, but overall biodiversity and species richness decrease with salinity. Generally, salinity tolerance for biota increases from fish to zooplankton to macroinvertebrates and, accordingly, dramatic shifts in energy pathways and food web compositions will occur as salinity changes. While shifts in species composition have been described, causal relationships and energy pathways remain unknown. Also, to better understand the consequences of human and environmental impacts on future water quality and availability, more research on saline lakes is essential. During a multi-year survey of 20 prairie lakes with salinities ranging from fresh to hypersaline, traditional limnological methods will be used to characterize the abiotic environment and littoral and pelagic communites. Stable isotope methodology will be applied to identify littoral vs. pelagic energy sources, trophic pathways and productivity patterns. This combined approach will allow me 1) to elucidate how changes in fish, plankton and littoral composition will affect energy flow and overall productivity in fresh vs. saline lakes, 2) to quantify the relative importance of littoral subsidies to the pelagic communities across lakes, and 3) to identify which environmental parameters are most influential for these processes. Once food web patterns are established, I will predict changes in food web composition and productivity as salinity increases in lakes across the prairies due to a drier climate predicted by climate change scenarios. Because salinity-induced changes in food web composition are most pronounced in systems with low salinities, which represent about half of all lakes across the prairies, the effects of climate change on lake ecosystems should be detectable much faster in prairie lakes than elsewhere.

"The use of biofuels as renewable alternatives to oil has ignited the interest of government, the public and scientists.  One of the most promising sources of such biofuels is the complex of sugars that are locked in the stems and stalks and leaves of plant material in the form of the glucose polymer cellulose.  Ever-increasing efforts are being put into the development of environmentally friendly ways of degrading the cellulose component of biomass sources such as wood chips, wheat straw and waste paper into glucose, which can then be fermented to ethanol in traditional ways.  This enzymatic degradation process is hindered by the very real fact that plant cell walls are complex, thus a mixture of enzymes is needed to carry out this process efficiently.  Further different mixes are needed for different sources of biomass.  Considerable effort is thus expended in devising ""cocktails"" of enzymes that are optimal for this purpose - either ""in vitro"" or ""in vivo"" with recombinant organisms.  Another problem is that degradation efficiency often drops substantially during conversion - but it is difficult to know if all enzyme activites are being lost or, more likely, a single rate-limiting enzyme.  Tools are needed to monitor these enzymes.  We have developed a limited set of specific 'tags' to selectively ""colour code"" or ""mass tag"" a subset of the enzymes involved in biomass degradation and have shown that these can be used to quickly identify the amount and type of such enzymes produced by micro-organisms that are degrading biomass.  In this project we shall synthesise a full set of such colour-coded tags to allow rapid, simultaneous analysis of the full set of enzymes present in complex mixtures of enzymes used in biomass-converting reactors.  Such reagents will allow the rapid monitoring of biomass-degrading systems so that enzyme compositions can be optimised during the process.  They will also be useful for the profiling of biomass-degrading enzymes in the natural environment in a search for useful new enzyme combinations, for applications to bioenergy and to other processes requiring enzymatic conversions.  These include the pulp and paper, food processing and textiles.","Development of tools for facile monitoring of biomass-converting enzymes","Alternative energy resources",CANADA,CANADA,Enzymes

"Technological innovation and biological discovery are intimately related. The last ten years have seen a complete paradigm shift in the life sciences, occasioned by transformative technologies that allow us to rapidly and quantitatively analyze samples on the DNA, protein, and cellular levels.  Exploiting and furthering these advances requires a new generation of biologists, physical scientists, and engineers.  Biologists must increasingly be quantitative and must be intimately familiar with the capabilities and limitations of emerging technologies.  Similarly, engineers and technologists must have first hand knowledge of the current opportunities and bottlenecks in science.  The traditional boundaries of biology, physical science, and engineering are thus becoming blurred, and there is an urgent need for training programs that bridge the nexus of technology and biology.

      In response to this we will establish a cross-cutting training program focused on the development and application of high-throughput technologies in biological research. We have assembled a like-minded coalition of world-leading researcher labs from the physical, life and engineering sciences to create a unified graduate training program.  The training of graduate students from engineering, chemistry, physics, and biology will be combined through a series of research rotations, industrial internships, international exchange, and a tailored curriculum including hands-on training workshops, new course offerings, and professional development activities.  Students from diverse backgrounds will work side-by-side and will gain first-hand exposure to modern technological innovations in the context of outstanding biological and biomedical research topics.  Trainees will receive hands-on training with state-of-the-art instrumentation, ranging from high-end mass spectrometry, to next-generation sequencing, to nanofabrication.   We anticipate that this graduate program will become a flagship of interdisciplinary training at the international level, uniquely positioned to train the next generation of scientists.

"The ambitious goal of modern subatomic theory is the unification of all of the fundamental forces. Although the standard model is believed to explain the basic principles of all non-gravitational interactions of subatomic physics, the unification of gravity with these fundamental forces has proven to be a difficult and elusive problem. Gravity must be quantized in order for this unification to be carried out. As of today, it is still not 

clear what the correct quantum theory of gravity is;  however, string theory provides a renormalizable field theory containing gravitons and is, thus far, the most successful theory that unifies gravity and the subatomic forces in a quantum setting. However, it is still unclear how Einstein gravity emerges from string theory. Recently, important clues about this connection have been provided by the derivation of black hole entropy from string theory, matrix model dualities and in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, 

important questions still remain. What is the connection between causality in Einstein gravity and string theory? Can the diffeomorphism invariance of Einstein gravity be faithfully encoded in a boundary conformal field theory? How does a classical large scale 4-dimensional spacetime emerge from a quantum string state? 



My research interests are toward answering these fundamental questions. My approach is to examine the roles that topology and global geometry play in classical and quantum field theory. In particular, I look at connections between the global structure of string theory and Einstein gravity. I am using global techniques to obtain a deeper understanding of black hole entropy, causality and diffeomorphism invariance in the AdS/CFT correspondence. I also investigate the use of techniques from string theory and gravity in solving various problems in mathematics. My goal is to exploit the commonality of global structure in both classical gravity and string theory to obtain a deeper and more fundamental understanding of their connections.","Geometry and topology of classical and quantum fields","Physical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Theory of elementary particles and fields"

"Dealing with the overwhelming amount of information readily available today is one of the biggest challenges for individuals, as well as organizations.  Current database and information retrieval systems enable users to quickly obtain vast amounts of information in textual form -- but a serious bottleneck remains by reading, interpreting, and using the collected information.

    Clearly, users are in dire need of more advanced, semantically-oriented systems that help them analyzing, transforming, and creating knowledge from large amounts of (textual) data. Foundations for this kind of support have been developed for many years in fields like text mining, ontology, and the Semantic Web. Yet widespread support has not yet materialized in the tools and desktop environments available in current systems. This is due to a gap between current knowledge analysis research, which aims at algorithmic foundations and is rarely concerned with software engineering questions, and software engineering research that likewise barely targets the systematic engineering of knowledge-intensive systems and their particular requirements.

    This research aims to close this gap. It is one of the first to address both software engineering of semantic systems, as well as knowledge management foundations using ontology and text mining approaches. Foundations and applications are developed in close collaboration with domain experts. One particular domain is software engineering itself, which thus becomes both foundation and target for semantic system development. The research will progress from short-term objectives, analyzing requirements and developing foundations for fields like biomedical research, cultural heritage data management, and business intelligence, to long-term foundations in semantic system engineering. A central focus and testbed of our research targets the conceptual and technical integration of semantic technologies with common desktop environments, including word processors, email clients, Web browsers and software development environments, which will fundamentally change the way users interact with their systems.","Engineering of semantic software systems and applications of semantic technologies in solftware engineering","Information, computer and communication technologies",CANADA,CANADA,"Information technology"
"In 2006, the Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) Ministers of Agriculture announced the need for a National Agriculture and Food Traceability System (NAFTS), starting with livestock and poultry. An Industry-Government Advisory Committee (IGAC) was established to lead the development and implementation of a national traceability system for the livestock and poultry components of NAFTS. 



IGAC reviewed and established seven project charters on critical issues, one of them being Traceability Research and Development (R&D). Currently, most of the traceability research conducted in Canada is aimed at the identification and movement reporting of animals. Few resources are allocated for the development of traceability technologies. As for agriculture and food research in general, there is currently no process to develop and share research priorities; to communicate projects' results and the list of on-going projects; nor is there a forum where collaborative work can be facilitated.  



In order to address those gaps, IGAC endorsed the recommendation that the University of Manitoba host a conference and workshop that will result in the development of a national research and development strategy for agri-food traceability. The event is scheduled for June 2 and 3, 2009 in Winnipeg and has a target audience including users of technology (e.g. producer groups, auctions), service providers including traceability database managers, Canadian and international researchers (research stations, universities), research grant officers (university and FPT governments), research network members, and policy makers, regulators (FPT Governments). The identified outcomes of the event will include: increased knowledge of latest findings and technologies allowing and assessment of current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for Canada; identified knowledge gaps and research priorities; networked stakeholders; and an agreed-upon vision statement and performance outcomes that includes HQP training and skills needs.

"The Canadian agricultural landscape includes some 4,804,496 hectares of tame or seeded pasture and 15,391,072 ha of natural land for pasture (Stats Can 2007).  The majority of this forage is used by the Canadian beef cattle industry as a source of feed for cows, bulls and growing/young stock. Understanding how cattle adjust their grazing behavior to contend with changing environmental and forage dynamics is paramount to a healthy grassland ecosystem and to optimize livestock production. Due to the challenges of working with free-ranging animals, little work has been done with respect to metabolic and behavioural strategies used by grazing animals, and to our knowledge, there is no published work pertaining to fall and winter grazing under environmentalc onditions typical of Canada. The fall and winter periods present a unique opportunity to evaluate animal response to dietary and environmental stressors. 

The proposed research will provide new information regarding metabolic and behavioural responses of grazing animals to 1) low protein diets, 2) low forage availablility and 3) cold exposure.  Initial work with confined animals will be followed by field trials that will assess animal strategies to optimize energy balance and fermentation efficiency. Once validated, these results will be used to improve models that predict animal performance and environmental impacts in pasture and grasslands typical of those found in Western Canada. Due to past difficulties in working with the free-ranging animal, our knowledge of grassland ecosystems has lagged behind that of other types of agricultural land. Given the large acreage of grassland in Canada, contributions with respect to food production and new challenges related to climate change and agroenvironmental schemes to protect our natural resources, this research is essential as it will provide important insights into the plant-animal interface and our abilty to improve management of grassland ecosystems.

"Complex spatial and temporal dynamics and pattern formation are ubiquitous features of spatially extended nonlinear dynamical systems modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs), with applications in physics, chemistry and biology.  Such systems frequently feature the nonlinear interactions of many unstable degrees of freedom, complicated dynamics over a range of scales, energy cascades, and chaos in space and time.

    For most nonlinear, high-dimensional systems of interest, such as the celebrated problem of fluid turbulence, a detailed analytical understanding remains well beyond reach.  Nevertheless, even then one can sometimes obtain mathematically rigorous estimates for bulk properties.  The Rayleigh-Benard problem of a fluid layer heated from below attracts attention for its mathematical richness and its diversity of applications. For the problem of estimating bulk heat transport through the fluid in terms of the temperature drop across the boundaries, I have recently derived a reformulation for the realistic case of boundaries of finite conductivity.  My discovery that in the limit of large temperature difference, one should assume the boundaries to be insulating rather than conducting, has considerable implications which I propose to address.

    The main theme of my proposal is the study of model one-dimensional PDEs displaying spatiotemporally complex and chaotic behaviour, with the goal of obtaining insights relevant to more realistic higher- dimensional problems.  In particular, I seek to identify the relevant statistics to measure, and to clarify potentially universal properties of spatiotemporal chaos.  My approach is to have careful analysis - including rigorous estimates on averaged quantities - suggest appropriate numerical investigations, and vice versa, to obtain a detailed scale-by-scale understanding of the dynamics.

    The systems I am currently studying include a model for pattern formation with mean flow: the observed separation of scales and anomalous scaling seem to indicate a new type of spatiotemporal chaos.  A related model has recently found exciting applications to crystal growth and the formation of suncup patterns in snow.

"Nearly all previous experimental studies on the intense-field induced dynamic response of atoms and molecules suffer from the fact that signals are collected from all over the focal volume, so that important input parameters of the experiment such as intensity, time profile and phase of the radiation field are not well-defined. Particularly in short laser pulse interaction, it cannot be excluded that the distribution of the intensity of a laser focus is influenced by a complicate dependency of spatial time/pulse/laser-frequency distributions in the focus region due to a distortion of the laser wavefront or the influence of dispersive optical elements. This general problem can be solved with a new generation of time-of-flight mass spectrometer which offers the ability to record the ion yield of a well defined volume outside of the focus regime, where the laser intensity is nearly constant. This will allow us to measure the ion yield and the intensity distribution at focus as well as the pulse length/intensity/wavelength dependence form short pulse laser ionization processes.  Secondly, we want to use an electron - imaging spectrometer to understand a possible influence of Rydberg states on the ionization process. The measurement of the wavelength dependency will be completed with the search for non-linear inner shell ionization processes in atoms.","Visualization of short laser pulse ionization and dissociation processes","Not available",CANADA,CANADA,"Atomic and molecular studies"

"Probabilistic methods belong to the most important tools in theoretical computer science. While the design of efficient randomized algorithms is one of the obvious applications, probabilistic methods are also extensively used in other areas, such as combinatorics or in complexity theory. In this research program, I intend to develop and apply probabilistic methods in three areas of theoretical computer science.



(1) Algorithms: For hashing and dictionary problems, there is a gap between the type of algorithms that are used in practice and algorithms that have good theoretical properties. The best randomized dictionaries provide lookup and update operations in constant time (with high probability). But often the constants in the time and space bounds are huge, or the algorithms are too complicated to be accepted in practice. My goal is to find simpler algorithms, mainly for hashing applications, that have good running time guarantees, but where the constant factors in time and space are such that the algorithms become interesting for practical purposes.

(2) Distributed Computing: Problems on asynchronous shared memory models have been studied extensively, but with respect to randomized computation, many questions still remain unanswered. On the other hand, probabilistic methods seem to be a suitable tool to overcome the problems associated with asynchrony. My goal is to devise new randomized shared memory algorithms for selected problems such as mutual exclusion, or the simulation of strong atomic operations by weaker ones.

(3) Complexity Theory: The ""number on forehead"" multiparty communication model is an important computation model, that is not well enough understood. Good lower bounds in this model would have significant consequences for circuit, propositional proof, or branching program complexity. I intend to apply probabilistic methods, especially those based on universal hash families, in order to develop better lower bound methods and to gain a better understanding of the multiparty communication model.

"Our long-term objective is to understand how physical loading induces adaptations in bone structure, composition, and mechanics. Non-damaging dynamic strain increases bone mass by lamellar bone formation. Excessive loading, however, can cause bone damage leading to woven bone formation. The molecular signals for bone formation (osteogenesis) can originate from different sources. Bone cells convert mechanical stimuli into osteogenic signals to make new lamellar bone (mechanotransduction). We have found that fatigue loading (damage) induces the expression of osteogenic signals from blood vessels during early woven bone formation. However, it is not clear what role mechanotransduction plays in the woven bone response to damage. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that differentiate lamellar from woven bone, we are using the rat forelimb compression model. We will address two specific aims: (1) to determine the role of mechanotransductive signaling in lamellar versus woven bone formation we will compare gene expression and investigate the effects of inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2 - an important molecule in bone formation and mechanotransduction), and (2) to assess the contributions of dynamic strain versus damage we will reinforce the rat ulna (surgical pinning) after fatigue loading. We will use a finite element model of the rat ulna to assess the effects of surgical pinning reinforcement on the bone mechanical behaviour. Differences in bone formation will be assessed using computed tomography (CT), and bone formation indices (bone histomorphometry). Expression of genes associated with bone formation and mechanotransduction will be measured by quantitative reverse transcription-real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). These studies are a key to the ongoing development in our research program to understanding how the range of physical stimuli, dynamic loading to fatigue damage, induce bone adaptation. Understanding the mechanisms of bone repair will serve as a basis for future development of strategies to enhance tissue engineering for surgical implantation, and to promote rapid bone formation in fracture repair.","Osteogenesis - woven versus lamellar bone in response to mechanical loading","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,Biomechanics

"In mathematics and physics a soliton is a self-reinforcing solitary wave caused by a delicate balance between nonlinear and dispersive effects in the medium. Phenomena in physics where solitons occur include: special water waves, atmospheric waves, and waves in non-linear optics. Solitons are industrially relevant in transmission through fiber optical systems that increases the performance of optical telecommunications. Partial differential equations (PDEs) that have soliton solutions show many characteristic properties, as the existence of so-called Baecklund transformations that generate more complicated soliton solutions from simpler ones and the existence of non-linear superposition principles of solutions. The relatively young field of Discrete Differential Geometry is able to derive all these properties of such PDEs from a deeper principle: the consistency of a discrete (n+1)- dimensional grid that is built from n - dimensional discrete faces that satisfy a so-called face relation. PDEs with soliton solutions, together with their Baecklund transformations and superposition principles can be derived through suitable limiting procedures from those (n+1) - dimensional grids. One aim of this proposal is to study such face relations (e.g. the determination of major classes of 3- and 4-dimensional face relations) and for that purpose to develop computer algebra algorithms and refine techniques that are needed to solve the related algebraic conditions of unprecedented size, involving 10^17 terms (these techniques will have other applications afterwards and are of potential interest for commercial computer algebra systems as well); hence, to make a statement whether 4-dimensional integrable solitonic systems exist, and thus to contribute to a deeper understanding of the integrability of PDEs. This research will be done in collaboration with leading international experts in this area from the TU Berlin and LMU Munich.

Other intended projects that also require the solution of large overdetermined systems of equations are: - the symmetry classification of supersymmetric PDEs, - the study of symmetries and conservation laws of physically relevant PDEs, and - the integrability analysis of hyperbolic systems.

"This research program will perform microbiological analyses on uranium mine tailings at the Deilmann

Tailings Management Facility (TMF) at Key Lake, Northern Saskatchewan. Cameco Corporation has funded a

number of research projects and other investigations to evaluate the long-term geotechnical, hydrogeological,

and geochemical aspects related to the stability of the tailings and on solute transport, with specific emphasis

on the behavior of elements such as Ra-226, Se, Mo, and As. More detailed information on the related

biogeochemical factors is required to understand evolution of the tailings and to allow predictions of the

long-term impact of the tailings on the surrounding environment. The role of microbial activity on the

biochemical cycling and mobilization of metals is well documented. However, the high pH and low

temperature of the tailings at the TMF's at Key Lake and nearby mines present a notably different environment

than uranium tailings in other regions of the world, therefore an in-depth study at Key Lake will provide

valuable information for TMF management and an opportunity to gain a better understanding of microbial

behaviour in extreme environments. The research will involve scientists from three universities, the National

Hydrology Research Centre and Cameco Corporation and will provide funding for two postdoctoral fellows, as

well as two Ph.D., one MSc and three undergraduate students. These HQP will conduct their research in a

multidisciplinary environment spanning mining, environmental science and microbiology, and will be applying

leading-edge genomics, synchrotron based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) measurements

and imaging tools to discover, characterize and experimentally assess microbially-induced processes in tailings

evolution.","Description of microbial activity and potential effect on solute transport in long-term uranium waste management",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,Microbiology
"Intensified awareness of environmental protection has renewed interest in microbially-mediated processes for restoring contaminated environments and converting waste and other substrates into value-added products such as ethanol. Microbes in these processes are often in close association with surfaces, where the cells grow as biofilms. A lack of information about the factors controlling metabolism of biofilms in natural and engineered environments limits our ability to fully exploit or manage their activity. Similarly, our inability to control biofilm survival and proliferation in clinical settings has resulted in an alarming increase in hospital-acquired infections and multi-drug resistance. My current NSERC Discovery grant has enabled me to develop novel approaches to study biofilm form and function, which provided a platform for establishing a number of academic and industrial collaborations during the four years since moving to Ryerson from South Africa. The goal of the proposed Discovery grant is to conduct fundamental research complementary to three of these collaborations:

1) To improve understanding of biofilm ecology and associations between cellulolytic bacteria and their substrate in consolidated bioprocessing for the conversion of biomass to ethanol.

2) Generate data on microbial growth and metabolism to be coupled with geochemical models to predict the potential role of microbial (biofilm) activity in the long-term environmental impact of uranium tailings management facilities.

3) Develop new approaches to study biofilms at solid-air interfaces. Because of the demonstrated relevance of these biofilms in the food processing environment, nosocomial outbreaks in health care facilities, and their role in the survival of microorganisms in the hospitality industry and industrial housing complexes, there is a need for such development.

"The focus of my research is the design and implementation of efficient and robust numerical algorithms for large scale, hard, optimization problems.  Such problems arise in many important applications, e.g. molecular conformation, inverse imaging, machine learning, and, in particular, these problems arise in the relaxations of hard combinatorial optimization problems. In many instances, these problems are both large scale and ill-posed, i.e. hard to solve numerically.



The techniques that I use involve continuous optimization, nonlinear programming, NLP, and in particular, semidefinite programming, SDP.  For SDP, my research contributions include strong duality results, stable algorithms, and the study of relaxations for various applications.  For NLP, I have derived trust region algorithms for large scale unconstrained minimization, as well as stable sequential quadratic programming methods.

"All living things have specialized molecules, called enzymes, to carry out specific biological functions. A number of enzymes have evolved to use radicals (highly reactive lone electrons) to perform biological transformations.  The advantage of radicals lies in their highly reactive nature, and therefore ability to carry out reactions that are chemically difficult and require a lot of energy. However, radicals react indiscriminately, which can damage the enzyme.  Enzymes are dynamic systems; hence, the timing of internal motions must be exquisitely synchronized with chemical events to prevent the radical extinguishing itself.  The goal of the research laboratory is to study how enzymes orchestrate radical chemistry with large structural rearrangements.  To do this, the laboratory will study an enzyme that contains a vitamin B12-derivative, which it uses to initiate radical chemistry through breakage of an unusual carbon-cobalt bond.  The radicals are then propagated to another vitamin-derived molecule (vitamin B6), nestled in the enzyme at a distant location. Fast-reaction spectroscopic techniques along with chemical synthesis of novel compounds similar to B12 will allow for an in-depth investigation into the kinetic and dynamic behaviour of the enzyme.  From this research, models for radical-based catalysis will be derived that can be applied to other enzyme systems. The research will also enable us to re-engineer enzymes to carry out other chemical transformations that are applicable to drug synthesis or other industrial purposes.  However, to study an individual enzyme, it first must be separated from all of the other thousands of proteins and enzymes in the bacterial cell.   A high-pressure liquid chromatography system, like the ï¿½KTA FPLC is designed to do just that.    The system is fully automated and is able to separate proteins at high resolution, quickly and reproducibly.   The system is widely used in industry and academia, and HQP who gain expertise on the ï¿½KTA system will be better prepared for future careers in research and development.  An ï¿½KTA FPLC, or a comparable system, is currently not available at UBC Okanagan.

"    )	Mutations in plants can lead to altered flower morphologies, or homeosis.  For example, petals can be replaced by sepals and pollen-producing stamens can be replaced by petals.  A comprehensive nuclear genetic model for flower development has been derived for Arabidopsis, and orthologues of critical genes can be identified in other species.

    )	Homeotic phenotypes are observed in carrot, but in contrast to nuclear gene control in Arabidopsis, the mutation in carrot is conditioned by a cytoplasmic factor, likely in the mitochondrion.  The occurrence of  cytoplasmic homeosis suggests that cytoplasmic-nuclear signaling occurs in flower development. The research proposed here will work towards the development of a genetic pathway for this process, which has not been elucidated in any plant species.

    )	Carrot can serve as a novel model system because the cytoplasmically-controlled homeotic phenotypes evolved in natural populations and inbred lines are available with distinct nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions: the replacement of stamens with petals, or both petals and stamens with bract-like organs.  The phenotypes result from two nuclear genotypes interacting with one cytoplasmic accession.  In other species, the cytoplasmic regulation of flower development results from backcrossing into alien cytoplasms or protoplast fusion, and distinct phenotypes related to specific cytoplasmic-nuclear interactions are not clearly observed, as in carrot.    )	

    )	The long-term objective of this research is to discover all the genetic components important for mitochondria to nucleus signaling affecting flower development.  Ultimately, the research program could directly link expression of a mitochondrial factor to orthologs of genes in the Arabidopsis floral development model, advancing basic knowledge in an emerging area of plant biology.  In the short term, genes related to redox will be studied, and differential gene expression assessed, in floral meristems of cytoplasmic mutant and wild type carrot lines.

"In practice, inference concerning a scalar parameter of interest generally is achieved by using first-order asymptotic methods.  These methods, however, can give misleading inference when the sample size is small.  In recent years, higher-order asymptotic methods have been studied extensively.  Regardless of the extreme accuracy (in terms of tail probability approximations) of the higher-order methods, they are not popular because of the limited ""accessibility"" of these methods.  The first aim of this propoal is to implement the higher-order methos to some standard statistical and algebraic softwares such as R, Splus, Maple, and Matlab for some commonly used parametric models.



For semi-parametric and nonparametric models, higher-order methods have not been popular due to the complexity in calculations.  Even first-order empirical likelihood ratio method frequently encountered numerical calculation problems.  The second aim of this proposal is to develop a method that can generally solve the numerical calculation problems associated to the first-order empirical likelihood ratio method, and then ""correct"" the first-order empirical likelihood ratio method to obtain more accurate tail probability approximations.



Bayesian inference depends on the assumed prior density.  A different choice of the prior density may have different inferential results for the parameter of interest.  The third aim of this proposal is to apply the theoretical results in parametric higher-order methods to develop a systematic way of obtaining a prior density which will have the property that the Bayesian's p-values being the same as the frequentist's p-values.  Moreover, the higher-order methods can be applied to obtain the Bayesian's p-values without the necessary MCMC or high dimensional integrations.



The last aim of this proposal is to perform systematic comparisons among bootstrap, MCMC, and higher-order methods.  In particular, a study of the similarities and differences among these methods in tail probability approximations will be carried out.","Asymptotic inference based on likelihood function","Mathematical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Parametric inference"

"In recent years, considerable attention has been given to organizing the computing resources in a data centre as a common infrastructure to be shared by multiple applications. Each application has its own workload and performance goal. The workload is time-varying because the demand from users may change over time. In managing the resources in a data centre, an important consideration is to achieve efficient resource utilization and high probability of meeting the performance goal of individual applications. Virtualization technology can be used to improve flexibility in resource management. Applications are deployed on virtual machines which are implemented on physical resources. By dynamically allocating these resources to virtual machines, the system can adapt to changing workloads and provide good performance to individual applications.

  

The proposed research is concerned with the design and evaluation of dynamic resource allocation algorithms for data centres. The system performance seen by each application is affected by the amount of resources allocated to the various virtual machines. Utility functions are used to provide a basis for performance optimization. These functions can be used to represent user satisfaction or revenue generated. The objective is to maintain a desired balance between maximizing a utility function based on workload and response time performance and minimizing the cost of resource usage. The latter is relevant to power management because using fewer resources means lower power consumption. It is expected that effective algorithms and tools for dynamic resource provisioning and self optimization in large data centres that support a diverse set of applications will be developed.

"Over the past several years, software development has moved from producing standalone, traditionally engineered systems to assembling and evolving Systems of Systems or ultra-large-scale systems. This direction is prevalent in many well-known application domains, including commercial enterprises, healthcare, e-government, and military, where constituent legacy systems are increasingly integrated to provide modern, coherent, valuable forms of services to an astute, network-connected audience.



This current, practical reality poses significant problems for software maintenance in various ways, including sheer size, lack of a controlling authority, escalating levels of demands, accelerating schedules, geographic distribution, emergent behavior, diversity of technologies, and regulatory constraints. In the unfolding paradigm, systems are grown together opportunistically and collaboratively as needs dictate, not completely planned in advance with a full set of requirements. Nevertheless, software maintenance research has largely isolated each constituent system in its own silo for analysis, often fragmented, with relatively less attention paid to following impacts, information flows, and behaviors across multiple, loosely-coupled systems and mixed implementation technologies and languages.



The expected significance of the research program is improving our general ability to deal with the large-scale, software-intensive systems so prevalent today in industry and government. Without a more complete understanding and a body of long-term experience with Systems of Systems issues, researchers and educators in the field of software engineering will become less and less relevant against the industrial practice. The proposed research program will seek the right concepts, techniques, and processes to help address the mounting challenge.

"At present, modern communications are faced with two important challenges: a) the ever increasing demand in transmission capacity, and b) the demand of higher quality and lower costs in transmission and reception. MIMO wireless systems are important due to their enormous potential in meeting these challenges. The use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver in a MIMO system increases both the reliability of communication as well as the transmission rate (or capacity) for the same bandwidth and with no additional power expenditure. However, current practical MIMO implementations are still far from predicted theoretical performance due to limitation of the present hardware technology to meet the complexity of sophisticated MIMO transceiver techniques. 



The goal of the present proposal is to devise MIMO transceiver algorithms by applying advanced DSP techniques so that the advantages offered by the MIMO concept can be realized and implemented in practice. Specifically, research work will be carried out in the following areas with the immediate goals of:



a)  To develop novel convex optimization algorithms, and to fully exploit and develop our knowledge in matrix transformations for facilitating the use of simple and implementable receivers, resulting in optimum designs of transceivers for single-user and multi-user MIMO communications under imperfect channel state information.

b)  To fully develop simple optimum space-time block codes for MIMO systems equipped with simple low-cost receivers, and to exploit the time diversity of these codes to overcome the performance disadvantage of the simple receivers.

c)  To fully develop our knowledge in the area of robust adaptive beamforming applied under the circumstances of incomplete or imperfect channel state information in MIMO communications.

"A fairy tale from the Grimm brothers (Rumpelstilskin) talks about turning straws into gold. In this proposal,

new technologies will be developed in areas of nano- and bio-technologies to turn agricultural (corn stovers,

wheat straws) and woody (wood chips and sawdust) feedstocks to green gold (biofuels in the form of ethanol).

The green gold technology is significantly different from the traditional black gold (petroleum) technology in

two aspects. 1. The process of extracting crude oil from the ground and using gasoline as the transport fuel

release significant amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG). These GHGs have been linked to global warming

which can have significant impacts to mankind in the near future. The use of ethanol as the transport fuel can

minimize GHG emission. 2. In contrast to crude oil which can one day be depleted, bioethanol can be

generated from renewable sources. Currently, three technologies are involved in bioethanol production. These

include sugar ethanol from sugarcane in Brazil, grain ethanol from corn and wheat in North America and

cellulosic ethanol from corn stovers and wheat straws from many countries. Since Canada is not ideal for

sugarcane cultivation and the grain ethanol approach has caused a major concern with the perception of food

for fuel, cellulosic ethanol is the best choice for Canada. However, the enzymes (cellulases and hemicellulases)

required to break down cellulose to glucose are relatively complex and costly. New technologies to improve the

activities of these enzymes and to lower the production cost would be needed. In this proposal, a tiny protein

platform will be engineered to capture different enzymes to form a nano-enzyme complex which can work

cooperatively to break down cellulose. These enzymes will be assembled on the platform in a predetermined

order. Degradation intermediates will diffuse from one enzyme to the other in close proximity. Highly efficient

enzymes are selected to incorporate into the platform. All these components will be recombinantly produced

using a microbial factory (Bacillus subtilis, a non-pathogenic bacterium) developed in my laboratory. These

technologies, if successfully developed, will allow cellulosic ethanol production to be truly cost-effective.","Development of an engineered cellulosome-based cellulase/hemicellulase system for efficient, cost-effective hydrolysis of cellulose from agricultural and woody feedstocks","Alternative energy resources",CANADA,CANADA,"Protein manipulation and expression"
"This proposal has two projects. The first project focuses on streptavidin engineering.  Streptavidin is a four-subunit, biotin binding protein.  Because of the tight binding, streptavidin serves as an immobilization agent for biotinylated proteins. A new streptavidin designated M6 has been designed by us.  It has only one subunit per molecule and can bind biotinylated proteins in a reversible manner.  M6 has a single cysteine residue and can form a disulfide bond with recombinant proteins carrying a cysteine containing biotinylation peptide tag designated CPFB. Therefore, M6 has the ability to immobilize CPFB tag containing recombinant proteins. By the addition of a reducing agent and biotin, CPFB tag containing recombinant proteins can dissociate from M6. This feature makes the M6 system suitable for the development of reusable chips, bioreactors and other applications.  The first objective for this study is to test whether we can develop reusable chips using the M6 system.  One drawback for this system is that the CPFB tag has to be biotinylated.  If the biotinylation step can be omitted, the system can be even more versatile. Therefore, the second research objective is to replace the CPFB tag with another tag that can bind to M6 without the requirement of biotinylation. A cysteine residue will be introduced to that tag and the formation of disulfide bond between the tag and M6 will be examined.  The third objective is to see whether it is possible to make the monomeric streptavidin to have the biotin binding capability as good as the natural streptavidin through protein engineering.  The long-term objective for the second project is to use a non-disease causing bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, as a surface display system to display biomolecules on the cell surface.  The displayed molecules can be enzymes to digest polymers present in our environment or antigens for vaccine preparation. We will study enzymes (sortases) that can covalently link cell wall proteins to cell wall and their substrates in B. subtilis. The physiological roles of these wall bound proteins will be determined.  A surface display system will be developed based on the knowledge generated from this study.

"Communication between cells is the core issue of biological science. In the brain, communication takes place at a specialized structure named the synapse. In addition to functioning as an information gateway between brain cells, it is well known that the strength of synapses can undergo long-term changes in an experience-dependent manner. This plastic property of synapse, which is termed as synaptic plasticity, is the cellular model for learning and memory. Thus, understanding the biological mechanisms of synaptic plasticity will greatly advance our knowledge of how memory is formed in the brain.



Synapses consist of two structural components: namely the presynaptic terminal and the postsynaptic membrane. Given that these two components are separated by a nanometre wide gap, it has been suggested that they communicate within a synapse to regulate synaptic functions. In this grant proposal, we hypothesizes that this form of intra-synaptic communication is necessary for the formation of synaptic plasticity. Using a newly developed method to simultaneously measure changes in pre- and postsynaptic components, we will investigate if there is crosstalk between pre- and postsynaptic components during the formation of synaptic plasticity. The mechanisms underlying this crosstalk will also be investigated. Findings from this study will greatly advance our understanding of the cellular basis of learning and memory.

When a sensor is added to an RFID tag, it opens many other possibilities in commercial applications. For example, the use of temperature sensor and RFID tag can facilitate patient monitoring in hospitals and healthcare facilities. In this strategic research project, we will develop advanced RFID systems with sensing capabilities. The long-term goal of this project is the development of a new framework for commercially viable RFID-based sensor systems. The research team consists of researchers from the University of British Columbia, who have complementary expertise in circuit design, signal processing, communications, cryptography, and network protocols design. We propose to work towards the following inter-related objectives: (a) Design of energy-efficient RFID circuit blocks in order to minimize the overall power consumption and the size of tags; (b) Develop multiple-input multiple-output RFID systems that can increase the read range and reliability; (c) Develop novel data fusion algorithms that can improve the tag detection reliability and the operating range; (d) Design tracking and localization algorithms for mobile tags in order to improve the accuracy; (e) Develop efficient medium access control and cooperation protocols that can increase the success rate of detecting all the co-located tags; (f) Develop security and privacy mechanisms which have low computation complexity for tags. For proof-of-concept and technology transfer, we implement our proposed techniques in a testbed.

"The next generation fixed wireless broadband access networks are being increasingly deployed as wireless mesh networks (WMNs) in order to provide ubiquitous access to the Internet. Research and development of WMNs is motivated by several applications including broadband home networking, community and neighborhood networking, and metropolitan area networks. The aggregate capacity and performance of WMNs can be increased by the use of multiple channels. A multi-channel wireless mesh network (MC-WMN) consists of a number of stationary wireless routers, forming a wireless backbone. The wireless routers serve as access points for wireless mobile devices. Some of them also act as gateways to the Internet via high-speed wired links. Each router is equipped with multiple network interface cards. Each interface operates on a distinct frequency channel in the IEEE 802.11a/b/g bands. Using multiple radios in each wireless mesh router can improve the network performance significantly. However, there are various challenging research issues to be resolved in order to support quality-of-service (QoS) for multimedia services. Due to the limited number of available channels within the 802.11 frequency bands, interference between different neighboring links can occur if those links use the same channel. Other issues such as interference from other co-existing systems, user mobility, and constraints on control overhead and computational complexity also need to be considered.  The objective of this research is to investigate and develop algorithms for reliable and efficient information transfer over MC-WMNs. In particular, five specific research tasks are identified: (1) Development of adaptive logical topology formation and interface assignment algorithms; (2) Design of load balancing and routing protocols; (3) QoS provisioning in MC-WMNs; (4) Determine the capacity region of MC-WMN; and (5) Support security and user privacy in MC-WMNs. We foresee that MC-WMNs will be widely deployed as one of the wireless access network technologies in future. Results are intended to find practical solutions and applications for the benefit of Canadian and global telecommunication industries.

"The capability to predict nonlinear aeroelastic behavior has been the subject of intense research for many years, since the ability to forecast instabilities in the aeroelastic response of aircraft structures is of great importance in the aerospace engineering industry. The majority of the current prediction methodologies are based on a deterministic approach, in which a mathematical model (governing system equations with initial and boundary conditions) is derived, and a solution is computed by numerical simulations. In real world problems, uncertainty does exist and this could be due to the lack of information in the modeling, errors resulting from imprecise material properties or values of system parameters, noises in experimental measurements, etc. The other potential source for uncertainty could arise from numerical errors, such as discretization. Hence, for realistic modeling and simulation, the effects due to uncertainty can not be ignored. The proposed research will focus on incorporating uncertainty in aeroelastic response prediction. This is a challenging task because stochastic formulation must now be introduced in the aeroelastic model, and a novel simulation methodology has to be developed to avoid using the conventional but very inefficient Monte Carlo method.



Another topic in this proposal is to develop reliable tools for applications in computational acoustic (CA) simulations. A major issue in the aerospace industry is the noise caused by jet and turbofan engines. Developing robust and efficient CA techniques is the fundamental requirement for a successful application in noise predictions. However, unlike CFD (computational fluid dynamics), the progress in CA is less mature. The proposed research will identify the difficulties in CA, and investigate various computational methods for reliable solutions of acoustic wave propagation and the applications in aero-acoustic models such as the cavity simulation.

"Having the right requirements is critical to the success of developing and using information systems. However, getting the correct requirements can sometimes be rather complex. For routine, procedural, common tasks (e.g., payroll), this might be less of an issue because people have many reference points and past experience to based on. The situation is different when dealing with information systems that are, for example, unique, critical to bringing out the niche of the business, and reflect new ways of doing business.

Various approaches have been proposed to reduce this challenge of getting the right requirements. We believe that, in the business world, an understanding of how business strategy relates to information systems is necessary for reducing incorrect, missing, and changing requirements. This includes concepts such as market, employee skills, and share values, which are generally not explicitly represented in existing approaches.

We plan to utilize past work in business strategy, requirements engineering, and other related areas in our work. This includes, for example, frameworks on understanding and implementing business strategy (e.g.,

Mc-Kinsey's 7-S framework) and ""why"" constructs in Zachman's Enterprise Architecture framework. We propose to develop a representation for documenting business strategy, a methodology for acquiring it, a procedure for utilizing it in information systems design, and a CASE tool for supporting the above activities, as well as to conduct empirical studies to learn about the usefulness and limitations of this approach.

The novelty of our approach is in using intelligent agent concepts (e.g., goal, belief, reasoning, and learning) as a conceptual modelling paradigm and Bunge's Ontology to guide the decompositions of agents. Intelligent agents enable us to encapsulate details without losing the bigger picture, and decomposition allows us to get to those details when needed.

We expect the results of this work will reduce information system project failures, ease business-IT alignments, and better facilitate information systems integration.

"Cryptobia salmositica is a blood parasite found in all species of Pacific salmon on the west coast of North America. The parasite causes disease and mortality in fish. In parts of the Pacific Northwest the percentage of infected downstream migrants (young fish) may vary from 3-21% and infected fish die as readily in sea water as in fresh water. There have been outbreaks (e.g. on Vancouver Island) of the disease with high mortalities in juvenile and pre-market salmon cultured in freshwater and in sea cages. Also, in some States in the USA (e.g. Oregon, Washington States) annual mortality due to cryptobiosis can be from 50-60% in pre-spawned salmon brought into hatcheries from rivers/streams. 

There is no commercial vaccine against cryptobiosis. However, we have developed a very effective attenuated live experimental vaccine which protects 100% of vaccinated fish for up to 2 years. The vaccine strain does not cause disease in fish (both juvenile and mature fish) as it does not secrete matalloprotease (MP) - this enzyme is the 'disease causing factor'. However, there is concern that the strain may regain its ability to produce/secrete the enzyme on prolonged use in the field. 

The main objectives of present proposal are to (1) further study the reason for the increase susceptibility of pre-spawned salmonids to cryptobiosis, and (2) develop two new vaccines using biotechnology - by inserting the MP gene into plasmids (MP-DNA vaccine) and also by inserting the MP-DNA plasmids into a bacterium (E. coli) and harvesting its product (recombinant MP vaccine). The main rational of the new vaccines is get the fish to produce antibodies against the 'disease causing factor' so that on infection these antibodies will readily bind up the metalloprotease secreted by the pathogen and thus 'disarm' it. With no disease the immune system in the fish will readily control/eliminate the parasite.

"The economic and scientific importance of catalysis can hardly be understated.  It is estimated that 90% of all chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing depends on underlying catalytic processes.  The chemical and pharmaceutical industries are each $trillion/year industries (globally).  Additionally, many important future technologies associated with clean energy (e.g. fuel cells), environmental protection (e.g. greenhouse gas reduction, CO2 sequestration), and conventional energy (e.g. oil sands refining), to name a few, will depend on as-yet developed innovations in catalyst technology.  Therefore, the accelerated development of new catalyst technologies will be important to the competitiveness of Canadian pharmaceutical, chemical and high technology companies in the global marketplace.  Computational chemistry and molecular scale simulation have evolved into a powerful research tool for a broad range of disciplines in which a detailed understanding of chemical phenomena at the atomic level is beneficial.  Despite the proven success of computer modeling in many fields, the application of molecular simulation to study catalytic reactions still presents a challenge for established methods.  The overall goals of this research program are to advance cutting-edge computational tools designed to accelerate the development of new catalysts.  The approaches that will be developed will not be limited to traditional molecular modeling, but will also include more novel computer aided highthroughput catalyst screening tools.  The research will take place at the Centre for Catalysis Research and Innovation (CCRI), the only academic centre in Canada fully dedicated to catalysis research.  The CCRI holds an unique concentration of world renowned experts in catalysis and has the goal of acheiving excellence in catalysis research on a global scale.  The proposed research program aims to fully integrate novel computational tools into the research programs of these experts in order to make a genuine impact in the development of new catalyst technologies.","Development of novel computational tools for catalysis research","Materials sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Quantum and/or computational chemistry"

"This application by a collaborative team comprising one senior, one mid-career, & three junior investigators in two disciplines (Biology, Chemistry) from two universities is for an automated instrument to measure dissolved organic carbon (DOC) & total organic carbon (TOC, includes particulates and colloids) in freshwater and seawater. Experimental approaches will include environmental physiology, aquatic toxicology, & aquatic geochemistry, with a focus on fish & invertebrates. DOC (also sometimes called DOM - dissolved organic matter, or NOM - natural organic matter) is derived from terrestrial & aquatic plants and algae, as well as anthropogenic sources (e.g. sewage treatment plant effluent), & is ubiquitous in natural waters.  In the past decade, research by the applicants & others has demonstrated that ambient DOC plays a critical role in binding metals, & thereby modifying metal toxicity to aquatic organisms. Very recently, team members have shown that DOC also modifies the physiological properties of the gills (e.g. permeability, ion exchange rates, transepithelial potentials) in aquatic animals. Indeed, DOC may be as influential in this regard as water quality parameters such as hardness, alkalinity, & pH which are known to be critically important in the health of aquatic organisms. The focus now is to relate the concentrations, & more importantly the physical and chemical properties of various DOC's to their physiological & toxicological effects. This information will then be integrated into predictive models such as the Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) for improved regulation of metals in the environment, as well as into basic mechanistic understanding of gill physiology. The requested instrument will replace a worn out instrument, and will be essential for the research of 20 HQP trainees.

"Osmotic pressure changes cause water to flow across the membranes that encase living cells.  Such water fluxes can perturb cell structures and functions.  Cells respond by adjusting their content of substances called organic osmolytes (amino acids, sugars etc).  This ""osmoregulation"" controls water flow to ensure that cells remain properly hydrated, to stabilize their internal machinery, and to support their continuing growth.  The osmoregulatory machinery that modulates bacterial osmolyte content has been described.  Now we aim to learn how the osmoregulatory systems of bacterium Escherichia coli are coordinated.  We will test the following hypotheses.  First, the ProQ protein is an RNA chaperone that regulates the genes encoding osmoregulatory proteins, including ProP and ProU.  Second, ProP clusters with other membrane-based osmoregulatory proteins at the ends of E. coli cells, which are rod-shaped.  This protein clustering, resulting from specific interactions among cell membrane and ""cell skeleton"" components, is necessary for effective osmoregulation and cell growth.  

   This research is designed to address fundamental biological questions.  In addition to elucidating osmoregulatory mechanisms it may show us how bacterial cell structures form and function.  It is teaching us how to fully translate genomes, predicting the structures and functions of the encoded RNAs and proteins.  It may show us how small RNAs control gene expression.  Some E. coli strains promote the health of their human and animal hosts.  Other strains cause diseases when they infect intestines, brains, bladders or kidneys.  Although our work is not designed to directly address food or water safety problems, or control disease, it will show how osmoregulatory mechanisms help E. coli to survive in food, water and animals, including people.  Our discoveries will also apply to cells of other microbes, animals and plants that must tolerate osmotic pressure changes.  They include yeasts (used to make bread, beer and wine), plant root and leaf cells (which tolerate drought and saline soils) and kidney cells (which control the hydration of people and animals).","Bacterial osmoadaptation: coordination of osmoregulatory systems and their roles in cell growth","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Cell membranes"

"Computer-aided design systems have matured into comprehensive environments that enable users to efficiently work with their designs. A major strategy across these systems is to provide specific tools for each design domain. Inevitably, wide variety is needed -- there are many parts and configurations from which a building, or an automobile, can be composed. Two general approaches exist: comprehensive pre-defined part libraries and open systems that require writing scripts. The choice between these two (and their combinations) has historically been a tradeoff between short-term efficiency and long-term effectiveness. 



Bentley's GenerativeComponents (GC) is a system for representing designs and exploring alternative designs. It implements a suite of tools that supports designers in developing adaptable part libraries, in configuring designs to fit context and in reusing design work across projects. The tool suite combines a set of geometric and other data types, a parametric solver, a transaction-based representation, a unique replication system, a feature compiler, a scripting language and access to a full-featured development environment. Through an extensive period of co-development with an early adopter group from some of the world's top practices and universities, GC has been applied successfully to design problems both simple and complex.



This proposal aims at improvements in several aspects of GenerativeComponents and at new knowledge of algorithms and interfaces for design systems. Building on the existing GC toolset, the project will address issues in design process visualization and communication, rule-based generation of designs and software patterns for parametric design.

"Designers work by creating and evaluating alternatives. Current computer aided design software limits designers to a single design at a time. This project will develop new concepts and programs that enable designers to create, record, recall and reuse their design ideas. It will help designers create better designs more suited to their context and design brief. The project combines rigorous scientific inquiry into how alternatives are represented, creative design of new human-computer interfaces and application of both in professional practice and graduate education. Design research and the design professions will benefit through being able to consider and demonstrate to clients a wider range of design possibilities.

"Through my research, I aim to improve the effective and safe performance of people interacting directly with common technology, such as amusement rides and conventional industrial technologies. My next short term objectives relate to improving hands-on interfaces through the application of Human Factors (HF). First we will modify resource materials used by ride inspectors to make more use of the sense of touch. We expect this will improve inspectors' ability to learn from and apply these resources, and we will test this experimentally using simulations. Secondly, we will adapt and apply HF interface-design principles to ride controls to improve speed and accuracy of operation, and we will obtain results experimentally using simulation and also collect and analyse subjective measures including mental workload. We will also observationally study riders' behaviour in relation to ride design features and potential sources of error, and model these relationships qualitatively. We will then translate these findings into principles that inspectors may use to evaluate these ride interfaces. As part of this research, we will continue to develop investigation and analysis tools that will increase HF information obtained from accidents.

    Both the amusement ride domain and safety inspection have been the subject of little HF research despite having substantial impact on the public and employees. Ride controls and ride design are complex HF issues that go beyond existing knowledge. Therefore, this program of research will benefit those areas specifically, as well as providing generalizable knowledge about supporting users who prefer tactile information, the design and evaluation of complex, direct-contact interfaces, and equipping non-HF specialists with tools to evaluate HF. Graduate students will learn and apply qualitative and quantitative HF techniques including interface evaluation and design, usability assessment, unobtrusive and participant observation, and investigation. Cognitive and macroergonomics are less common skill sets among Canadian certified ergonomists, therefore this experience will equip students to meet occupational and public safety needs in Canada.

"Segmented polyurethanes, ""plastics"" frequently used in biomedical applications, are composed of alternating incompatible ""blocks"" of soft and hard segments. In work previously supported by NSERC,we have produced a family of these polyurethanes specifically designed to contain sites within the polymer that are sensitive to breakdown by molecules that occur naturally in soft tissue, enzymes. We put these sites in the hard block of the polyurethane, unique because the degradation of segmented polyurethanes is typically controlled via the soft block.  In this application we propose to turn our attention to the soft segment and incorporate a naturally based protein ""fragment"" (polypeptide) produced via recombinant DNA technology. Specifically we will use a polypeptide based on the protein elastin.  Elastin is found in elastic, extensible tissues such as arteries and has the quality of spontaneous self assembly into very small particles and fibers. In utilising the elastin as the soft segment or the ""plastic"", we will be able to control the mechanical properties, degradation rate and biological impact of the polyurethane. In part 2, we propose to expand the elastin-like polypeptide technology by designing and characterising a family of novel elastin polypeptide/polyethylene glycol block copolymer systems to produce different structures that can be used in a wide variety of drug delivery applications. Block copolymers form different structures depending on the proportion of hydrophilic (water loving)to hydrophobic(water hating)blocks.  Polyethylene glycol is water loving and the elastin-peptide is water hating. A limited number of studies have looked at using biologically based copolymer systems. Recombinant techniques could be used to produce block copolymers that form different structures with characteristics important to in drug release applications. In addition, these polymer system would likely be biocompatible, could potentially respond to temperature and be modified to target the drug delivery to a specific site.  Three graduate students, two Ph.D's and one masters as well as several undergraduate thesis students will be supported by this work.

"In order to understand how the brain functions we must be able to record the electrical activity occurring in specialized brain cells called neurons.  In order to make electrical recordings from these neurons we need to remove them from the mammalian brain.  To keep the neurons alive outside of the brain, they are cultured in an incubator for up to three weeks.  The first piece of equipment we are requesting is a laminar flow hood, which is used in the culturing process.  Without this piece of equipment the neurons become infected with bacteria and viruses found in the environment; once they are infected they can no longer be used for experiments.  Following successful culturing, we need to alter the expression of proteins of interest in order to determine their function.  To do this we need to transfect neurons with DNA and RNA that code for the protein we are interested in examining.  It is difficult to transfect neurons properly and maintain cell health.  However, there is a relatively new piece of equipment called the Amaxa Nucleofector, which achieves high-efficiency stable transfection with no compromise in cell health.  We are requesting funds to purchase an Amaxa Nucleofector to allow our investigation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying inhibitory synaptic plasticity. This research will benefit Canadians who suffer from memory problems associated with normal aging and neurological disorders, including epilepsy and Alzheimers'.

"The ability of animals to adapt to their ever-changing environments depends in large part on their ability to learn and remember.  To do so the brain deciphers thousands of electrical signals between billions of neurons at any given time.  However it is unclear what information contained within these electrical signals the brain deems critical.  For example, is it the overall amount of neural activity that is important or is it the small differences in timing between when two neurons are electrically active?  Our research is centered on examining not only how the brain decodes electrical signals, but on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory.  Using state-of-the-art recordings we are able to measure the electrical activity simultaneously from two neurons which are being modified in response to electrical signals that simulate learning.","Spike-timing dependent plasticity of GABAergic synapses in the hippocampus","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,Neurophysiology

"Proteins must fold into precise three-dimensional structures in order to function correctly. The folding process is an essential part of the flow of genetic information in the cell from storage to useful deployment. Despite many decades of research on protein folding, much remains to be learned about how the amino acid sequence affects folding, due to the experimental challenges in measuring the folding transition directly. This project will probe the basic principles of folding by using mechanical force applied by an optical trap to unfold and refold single protein molecules repeatedly. Individual folding trajectories will be measured with high-precision by monitoring the molecular end-to-end distance under both equilibrium (constant force) and non-equilibrium (changing force) conditions. Quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the folding process will be determined from these trajectories, including the free energy for folding, the folding and unfolding rates as a function of force, the presence and location along the reaction coordinate of intermediate states, and the location and height of energy barriers. The effect of sequence on these properties will be investigated systematically by varying the amino acid sequence of simple protein domains.

"Cognitive flexibility is a defining aspect of human cognition, and is essential for balancing performance demands, managing belief formation and revision, and monitoring one's own behaviour and performance. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of cognitive flexibility consistently report activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). However, the precise role of the dACC in cognitive flexibility is under debate, and this challenge is underscored by the wide range of situations for which the dACC is activated. Also poorly understood are the neural networks that are connected to the dACC, and how these change or remain stable under various conditions requiring cognitive flexibility. The aim of the research program is to specify the common role of the dACC under a range of situations requiring cognitive flexibility, and to map out its neural connections. Given that the dACC is proposed to be involved in switching behaviour, changing beliefs, and maintaining a balance between self- and other-reflection, a better understanding of the function of this brain region, and its connections, is of critical importance for understanding human behaviour. This research also has clear implications for treatment; for example, belief formation and self-monitoring are impaired in certain clinical populations such as schizophrenia and autism.

"In the past thirty years or more, the mathematical fields of partial differential equations and Riemannian geometry have come together to create the field called geometric analysis. This was partly motivated by General Relativity, where from the very beginning this synthesis has yielded considerable progress. In  recent years, there have been spectacular mathematical advances in certain areas of geometric analysis. An example is the Ricci flow, which is now understood to the point where it has yielded a claim of the hundred year old Poincare conjecture and the much broader Thurston conjecture, describing the nature of all smooth 3-dimensional compact objects (""manifolds""). The purpose of this project is to apply some of these advances to problems in physics. For example, the Ricci flow is also believed to describe, at least approximately, certain dynamical behaviour in string theory. A related flow promises to be important in the understanding of time-independent solutions of Einstein's general relativity theory. This project is aimed at exploring these connections.","Applications of Riemannian Geometry and Ricci flow in physics","Physical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Relativity and gravitation"

"Animal models of retrovirus-induced tumors have provided us with much of the foundation for our current understanding of the oncogenic process. Two economically important retroviruses associated with tumors of secretory respiratory epithelial cells are the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and Enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV) of sheep and goats. While JSRV and ENTV are highly related betaretroviruses that utilize the same cell surface receptor for virus entry, they have distinct tumor-inducing capabilities. JSRV transforms alveolar type II pneumocytes, while ENTV transforms nasal epithelial cells. The reason for this is not known. This proposal addresses the hypothesis that induction of tissue-specific tumor formation in the ovine host is either a function of cell-restricted activity of the long terminal repeat (LTR) or due to the fact that ENTV and JSRV require a coreceptor for virus entry and differences in affinity or coreceptor usage determines cellular tropism. To address these hypotheses, a molecular clone of ENTV will be constructed and used to generate infectious virus for in vivo studies. Upon demonstration that ENTV is the etiologic agent of enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma, a series of chimeric viruses generated via the exchange of genetic material between JSRV and ENTV will be constructed and used to map genetic elements responsible for tissue-specific tumor formation.  Specifically, the potential for coreceptor usage and restricted LTR activity will be addressed in these experiments. It is anticipated that this research program will contribute to our understanding of virally-induced cancers, uncover a potentially novel mechanism for retrovirus entry, and shed light on the mechanisms governing neoplastic transformation of secretory respiratory epithelial cells. Currently, no antemortem diagnostic tools are available for ENTV. Therefore, creating an animal model for ENTV infection allows for analysis of the cellular and tissue distribution of ENTV and subsequent identification of sensitive template sources for ENTV nucleic acid amplification. PCR-based diagnostic assays could then be developed and implemented in test and removal programs aimed at eradicating ENTV from Canadian sheep and goat flocks.

Flowers determine mating opportunities in animal-pollinated plants because pollinators transport male gametes (pollen) between flowers and plants.  My research on floral evolution considers floral design, the characteristics of individual flowers, and floral display, the combined effects of all flowers displayed on a plant.  First, I will investigate the evolution of floral display within the Polemoniaceae (Phlox family).  Chloroplast sequence data will refine my earlier phylogeny of Polemonium. I will then compare changes in flower size, flower number, and inflorescence architecture among Polemonium species and within related genera with well-resolved phylogenies.  Few studies have examined evolutionary changes in floral display among species, and none of these have considered plant size or growing season, two factors that affect the resources available for flowering.  Second, I will assess how variation in pollinators (hawkmoth and hummingbirds) affects selection on floral design in Polemonium brandegei.  I will expose artificial populations of plants to each pollinator separately, and examine relationships between floral traits and fitness, i.e., seed set and siring success.  Siring success will be measured using genetic fingerprints estimated with AFLP's, amplified fragment length polymorphisms.  Third, I will study how floral design, pollinator identity, and the surrounding community of rewarding flowers affect reproductive successs and hybridization between two species of lady's slipper orchid, Cypripedium. The mechanisms causing variation in hybridization rates are not well understood for most species, and have not been investigated in Cypripedium.  In Cypripedium, dimensions of pollinator entry and exit routes in the trap-like flowers may determine which insects are effective pollinators, and the floral community likely affects which insects are present.  These research objectives will contribute to my long term goals of understanding the evolution of floral display, and how variation in pollinators affects selection on floral design, and reproductive isolation between species.

"Random structures are useful for designing and analysing computer algorithms which solve modern-day problems. They can also be useful for understanding properties of large complex systems such as the link structure of peer-to-peer networks. This proposal aims to continue the study of some relatively new techniques for proving properties of random structures, as well as developing some very new techniques. It will advance the field of combinatorial mathematics in areas of fundamental importance, and aims also to include application-oriented topics arising from computer science, real-world networks, and other contemporary fields of science.



Some of the problems to be tackled involve load balancing. These problems arise when requests are sent to a set of processors (or storage disks), and one wants to allocate the requests  such that no processor is assigned many  more than its fair share. The aim is to show that certain very fast algorithms for performing the allocation often succeed in balancing the load quite evenly. Other problems relate to peer-to-peer networks. The aim there is to study the theoretical properties of the networks used in practice, concentrating on those properties that are desirable from performance considerations. Yet other problems involve further properties of random graphs, an abstraction of the above problems whose study has yielded the sort of techniques that are to be used in this work.



The overall impact of the proposal should be the solution of a number of problems of high contemporary interest, and a significant improvement of the understanding of the field.

"The objective of this research is to develop theoretical and applied statistical methods for the analysis of brain mapping data, in collaboration with my colleagues at the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre (BIC) of the Montreal Neurological Institute. The main scientific aim is to map the network of brain regions which are `activated' during the performance of a particular cognitive or sensorimotor task, using 3D images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The statistical challenge is how to adapt traditional statistical methods, intended for single numbers, to entire 3D images. 

     I have studied this using tools from pure mathematics: differential topology and integral geometry. Originally developed by Robert Adler twenty years ago, I have applied these tools to detect `activation' in the brain in response to an external stimulus. This cross-disciplinary collaboration with neuroscientists has in turn resulted in new statistical theory for random fields, the mathematical description of a random image. The major achievements have been  (i) an exact theory for the expected Euler characteristic of excursion sets of random fields of finite extent (the brain);  (ii) generalizations to a wide variety of common statistical analysis tools for relating brain activity to many simultaneous stimuli, or comparing brain activations across groups; (iii) extensions to higher dimensional data that incorporate time or smoothing, closely related to wavelet analysis; and (iv) the study of correlations between brain regions. 

     I propose to study several new types of random fields resulting from the analysis of (i) 'bubbles' data from face perception experiments, in which random regions of a face ('bubbles') are revealed to a subject who is then asked to perform a face discrimination task; (ii) connectivity and correlation within the brain and between the brain and a stimulus image; (iii) principal component random fields; (iv) non-negative least squares test statistic random fields; (v) confidence regions for 'activated' regions; (vi) random fields of non-parametric statistics such as the Mann-Whitney statistic.

"Condensed matter physics is the study of materials and patterns which can be constructed from atoms and molecules, seeking simple ways to express the origins of the diversity of physical properties which emerge from the essential ingredients of electrons, nuclei, and electromagnetic forces.  This research program focuses on understanding electronic properties, which are of tremendous technological importance and present fascinating conceptual puzzles.  Much of our current ability to describe the materials we use, such as metals, semiconductors, insulators and superconductors, arises from the fact that in some cases a single type of energy dominates the electronic behavior.  However, this is not always the case, and in fact systems in which a delicate balance is achieved between competing interactions are often the most important for applications while also being the most challenging to understand.  This research program aims to advance our understanding of electrons in solids in two lines of exploration, one focusing on the competition between disorder and electron-electron interactions and the other refining the capacity of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements to distinguish between competing theories of novel superconductors.

"Earth, unlike all other planets of the solar system, is characterized by the active cycling of elements through its atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. Models describing the  Phanerozoic evolution of these cycles ( e.g., the carbon, oxygen and sulfur cycles), usually apply a steady state approach. However, recently published high resolution C and S isotope data (Weissert & Erba 2004, Paytan et al. 2004) can no longer be explained in the context of a steady state system. Non-steady state mass balance models can successfully explain the above data, but require unrealistically large changes to volcanic or weathering fluxes (Paytan et al. 2004). Furthermore, all published hypotheses to date are unable to reconcile the C and S isotope records, a problem which is often referred to as the central problem of C and S isotope geochemistry (Holser et al 1988). 



Wortmann &  Chernyavsky (2007) suggested that salt extraction/evaporation events (e.g., the Zechstein in the Late Permian, the Gulf of Mexico evaporites in the Jurassic, or the Aptian evaporites in the South Atlantic) extracted enough sulfate from the ocean so that large parts of the marine subsurface bacterial ecosystem become dysfunctional, effectively disrupting the global biogeochemical cycles of C and S (Wortmann & Chernyavsky, Nature, 2007). This interpretation has important implications for the oxygen content of the atmosphere, the evolution of marine plankton, and allows, for the first time, a consistent interpretation of the Cretaceous C and S isotope record. Given the important consequences of this hypothesis, I propose a dedicated effort to track its geochemical signature in various environments and locations.

"The applicant proposes to research highly complex and yet unsolved problem of time-variant virtual acoustics based on measurement, analysis, and processing of spatial room impulse responses with the goal of providing the most accurate perceived reconstruction of room acoustics. The essential attribute of this simulation is time-variant room response that prevents the human ear from adapting to repeating patterns of sound. Time variance can occur due to several factors: movement of the source, change in source signal (due to direction- and frequency-dependent acoustic radiation pattern of the source), air movement and temperature variations within the room enclosure, movements of objects and people, physical changes in room boundary conditions (open doors, vibrating walls and windows, etc).



The final outcome of this program will be a synthesis of new virtual rooms that combine the selected acoustic components into time-variant systems responding dynamically to music and speech signals without repeatability. This will overcome the limitations of current engineering solutions, which use fixed impulse response convolutions and produce static room impression unsuitable for critical applications in music performance, rehearsal and recording. This interdisciplinary research will contribute tools, methods and intellectual gains to natural sciences and engineering while providing means for advancing music and acoustics research and the quality of life. One such outcome will be a library of synthesized impulse responses that will be used to electro-acoustically augment the quality of common living spaces. It is likely that in 10 years or so, uploading virtual acoustics to a person's wired living room will be as easy, as it is to upload today a new ring-tone to one's cell phone.

"Current threats against Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are becoming more and more sophisticated that prevention solutions based on single attacks are by no means effective. In fact, the current research is missing an understanding of the coordination among attacks and the collaboration among various attackers since that is emerging as a powerful strategy for malicious nodes. In MANETs, the identification of malicious activity is hard when one node misbehaves in route formation.  If multiple nodes act maliciously, simultaneously, or alternately, the schemes to deal with them become very slow at most nodes. Previous works have built a foundation for the work proposed in this research. The current research proposal will address issues of characterizing, modeling, and defense against coordinated/collaborative attacks for mobile wireless ad hoc networks. The specific objectives of this research are: (1) Classification of attacks: adversaries have collaborated together to conduct more complex and subtle attacks to prevent detection or identification. We will provide a more detail classification of collaborative attacks based on their different objectives and typical attacks in each type. By exposing the common properties of different attacks in the same group, we  will design generic detection and prevention approaches, (2) Detection and Prevention of Blackhole Attack: we will design a methodology for identifying multiple black hole nodes cooperating as a group with a modified AODV protocol by introducing some key mechanisms. We will study the impact of collaborative attacks on the existing routing protocols in ad-hoc networks, in order to gain insights on designing secure mechanisms, then, we will evaluate the proposed methodology and compare it with existing routing protocols. (3)  Detection and Prevention of Wormhole attack: we will design a mechanism to classify wormhole attacks in its various forms. (4) We will conduct experiments to characterize attack patterns and study the effects on fairness for scenarios under attacks. This research project is expected to contribute significantly to the advancement of knowledge in multi-hop wireless networks security.

"The proposed research involves experimental and computational studies to develop a fundamental understanding of metal oxides-water and ionic liquid (IL)-water interfacial phenomena in ionizing irradiation, or similarly aggressive chemical environments.  In such dynamic environments, chemical reactions and transport in each homogeneous phase and those at or across the interface are strongly inter-dependent, and often synergistic.  This synergistic interaction of multiphase kinetic systems has been practically ignored despite its industrial importance.  A wide ranging approach will be applied involving the study of individual reactions and integrated chemical systems, and the development of multiphase kinetic models using a finite element method.  The proposed research would have a range of industrial applications:  development of novel separation technologies for advanced nuclear fuel cycles and waste storage and treatment, and microbial corrosion of systems such as water and oil and gas pipes.

"Skeletal muscle is a very metabolically active tissue and accounts for the vast majority of peripheral blood sugar disposal. The movement of blood sugar, or glucose, into skeletal muscle is caused by insulin and insulin independent pathways such as muscle contactions. Glucocorticoids are a class of hormones that are produced in the adrenal cortex. In addition to possessing strong anti-inflammatory properties these agents also alter skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. The overall goal of my research program is to understand how glucocorticoids mediate this effect and to determine if oxidative stress is an underlying mechanism. Using rodent models we propose to determine if both insulin and contraction stimulated glucose uptake is impaired by glucocorticoids, what specific biochemical steps are altered, the effects of glucocorticoids on genes involved in these process and if antioxidant treatment can prevent these changes. The information from these studies will increase our fundamental understanding of skeletal muscle fuel metabolism, the mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids and the role of oxidative stress in these processes.

"My proposal consists of three parts, all related to the general area of pharmaceutical drug design.  Part I.  Improving the calculation of the binding affinity of a drug to a protein target.  Part II.  Creating a complete set of agonists and antagonists for the estrogen receptor.  Part III.  Creating an improved form of ""peptide patch"" to block the activation of the estrogen receptor(s).  Rationale:  The estrogen receptors and the estrogens which activate them (including the female hormones estradiol and estrone) are essential for determining female sexual characteristics and help to prevent diseases such as bone loss, heart attack and stroke.  After menopause estrogen levels drop by 90% and women become prone to these diseases as well as suffering from other symptoms such as hot flashes.  Thus, until recently, and still to a significant extent, many women after menopause began a regime of estrogen supplementation known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT).  However, epidemiological data have shown that long-term HRT usage leads to an increased risk of breast and uterine cancers.  The projects described in this proposal are aimed at creating safer drugs for HRT.  They will also help to understand how cancers develop, particularly breast cancer, and how they can be controlled with the new compounds we are trying to develop.

"One of the major mechanisms thought to facilitate the increasing complexity of organisms in the evolution of life is duplication of genes and entire genomes. We are investigating the regulation and evolution of duplicated genes belonging to the multigene family coding for the intracellular lipid-binding proteins (iLBP) of zebrafish. This family includes the fatty acid-, retinol-, and retinoic acid-binding proteins. iLBP proteins have been implicated in a myriad of cellular processes from uptake and intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids, bile salts and retinoids, to modulating gene expression, neurogenesis, and human disease. We chose zebrafish for these studies as it is hardy, disease resistant, easily and inexpensively reared, and useful in the application of both experimental embryology and genetic analysis. Moreover, zebrafish is a model system to study vertebrate development in which stages of embryogenesis are well characterized. To date, we have characterized 20 members of the zebrafish iLBP multigene family. Many zebrafish iLBP genes are duplicated owing to a whole genome duplication event that occurred in the ray-finned fish lineage ~230-400 million years ago. We have shown that transcription of several zebrafish duplicated iLBP genes is differentially induced by dietary fatty acids, i.e., only one duplicated gene is induced by fatty acids, and not the sister duplicate, suggesting evolutionary divergence of the regulatory elements in these genes. In this research progamme, we plan to identify the cis-acting regulatory elements in the zebrafish iLBP gene-promoters. Furthermore, we will determine which nuclear transcription factors and their activating ligands (e.g., fatty acids, retinoids, and clofibrate, a drug known to induce many mammalian genes involved in lipid metabolism) bind these cis-elements to induce specific iLBP genes, and how these cis- and trans-acting factors evolved. In addition, since many of the genes that control normal embryogenesis, growth and reproduction in zebrafish are similar, or the same, in mammals, zebrafish may serve as a model system to provide insights into the roles of the iLBP genes implicated in human development and diseases, such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and obesity.

"My area of research is environmental physiology.  Aquatic animals can live in environments that vary in terms of oxygen concentrations, salinity, temperature and other chemical parameters on a daily or seasonal basis.  My research program focuses on how these environmental factors disturb physiological systems and the mechanisms that aquatic animals employ to compensate for these perturbations.  We are particularly interested in understanding how fish balance water and ion levels, get rid of waste products (eg. ammonia) and obtain sufficient oxygen to function in changing conditions.  We are studying a small mangrove fish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) that survives out of water for weeks.  What special features of the gills, skin and/or kidneys allow them to balance body water and ion levels?  Another aspect of our work concerns the changing enviornment that fish and amphibian embryos experience during early life stages.  Neighboring embryos may deplete water oxygen levels and add metabolic wastes that impact early developmental processes.  When do embryos first sense these changes in their environment?  What mechanisms do they utilize to compensate for less than ideal water conditions?  Some species (eg. trout) are especially sensitive to swampy water (eg. high ammonia), whereas other species (eg. goldfish) are highly tolerant.  We will test whether in adult fish ammonia tolerance is linked to proteins that regulate ammonia uptake and/or enzymes that detoxify ammonia.  Our approach is to study the genes, cells and intact animals to understand regulation of processes at many different levels.  The insights gained from this research will potentially contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how aquatic ecosystems will be altered by climate change and provide fundamental knowledge of animal adaptation.

"The ability to navigate in our environment and remember the location of objects in that environment is central to survival.  Changes in location have long been correlated with changes in cell activity in the hippocampus, a brain region known to be important for spatial learning and navigation.  Evidence suggests that this hippocampal cell activity is controlled by the distance and angle/direction properties of an environment (metric) and other properties such as wall color and lighting (non-metric). These are the same types of cues that allow us, behaviourally, to distinguish between two environments. My recent work, using a response reversal paradigm (a rat is trained to turn right on a T-maze and then subsequently trained to turn left, thus the rat learns competing responses that produce interference between memories), has shown that metric properties, particularly direction, are the most important feature in distinguishing between two locations and allowing an animal to make a location-specific response. The research described in the present proposal will use a rat model to continue to investigate the role of direction in a variety of learning tasks and also to assess the role of another metric property, distance.  These results should allow us to understand how we use spatial information to prevent interference between memories that are formed.  A better understanding of basic memory processes and factors that interfere with memory retrieval, allows us to determine what processes are compromised when memory fails.  In order to treat or slow the progression of memory failure due to such disorders as Alzheimer's disease and dementia (disorders which affect the hippocampus), we first need to know how cells within the hippocampus are influenced by environmental cues and how this manifests itself in behavioral change.

"Wind energy is one of the most promising and fastest growing energy resources in the world. The installed wind energy capacity worldwide reached 58.9GW (gigawatts) by 2005, and the average global rate of growth over the last two years was 22.5%. Although the rate of growth in Canada over the same period was 46%, Canada was ranked 14th in wind power generation with a total wind power installation of just 0.68GW by the end of 2005. It is recommended by the Canadian Wind Energy Association that Canada achieve a wind energy capacity of 10GW by 2010. This would result in a reduction of approximately 20 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year.



A wind energy system is normally composed of a wind turbine, a gearbox, an electric generator, and a power converter system with a digital controller. The technological trend is towards large capacity wind turbines and generators (4 - 6 megawatts) with full-scale power converters. There are a number of challenging technical issues with high-power wind energy systems, such as development of efficient and reliable converters, compliance of transmission and distribution grid codes, management of active and reactive power flow, and advanced controls for system stability, protection and optimal performance.  



The main objective of this research is to develop efficient power converters and advanced control schemes for high-power variable speed wind energy systems. The research will contribute to the growth of fundamental knowledge through technological innovation in power electronics and wind energy control systems. Technology developed through this research can then be transferred to Canadian industry for commercialization, thereby leading to the creation of high-technology jobs and contributing to Canada's economic growth.

"Probabilistic robotics is the current state-of-the-art in mobile robotics research. However, the research on probabilistic robotics mostly focus on a single mobile robot, this makes one to speculate how the probabilistic robotics approach can be scaled up to deal with multiple mobile robots. Some initial efforts have been tried. It

is realized in this endeavor that the choice of uncertain knowledge representation is crucial in the design of any probabilistic algorithms. It is also emphasized that the development of new representation of uncertainty is absolutely essential for the probabilistic robotics paradigm to scale up to more complex problems, such as the problem of multi-robot coordination and collaboration. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to advance the probabilistic robotics research from a single robot oriented paradigm to a multi-robot oriented paradigm by (a) providing an uncertain knowledge representation and reasoning framework that is capable of

modeling multiple mobile robots and their environment; (b) using the proposed representation framework to study problems in multi-robots coordination and collaboration.



The anticipated significance of the proposal is twofold. From a theoretical development perspective, the proposed research advances the current research on probabilistic robotics from a single-robot paradigm to a multi-robot paradigm. From a practical perspective, it is not uncommon nowadays to see service robots appear in commercial market at affordable prices. The market for personal and mobile robots grew to $5.4 billion in 2004 and become larger than the industrial, non-mobile robot market; by 2010, that figure will approach $17 billion. How multiple service robots can cooperatively and collaboratively meet consumes' need have to be thoroughly studied before projected market value can be realized.

"One of the most important goals in the early detection of genomic-related disease, and the discovery of

associated biomarkers, is to identify and characterize the proteins and protein complexes present in related cell

lines. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a powerful tool for identifying and comparing the proteins

expressed in complex biological systems. However, the performance of mass spectrometers remains limited in

terms of the proportion of MS/MS data that can actually be interpreted. For example, up to 70% of the peptide

MS/MS spectra generated by quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometers, and up to 85% of those produced

by ion trapping instruments, cannot be interpreted using any available technique. Furthermore, a great deal of

time is wasted in acquiring and attempting to interpret these poor-quality spectra. Based on our experience,

literature review, and conversations with industry, it is apparent that the main obstacle to improving

performance in protein mass spectrometry is the lack of fast, efficient algorithms capable of real-time detection

and/or selection of target peptide ions for fragmentation and MS/MS analysis. The goal of the proposed

research is to overcome this challenge, and hence, increase throughput and efficiency for protein mass

spectrometry. This will be achieved by developing (a) an efficient algorithm for assessing the quality of peptide

MS/MS spectra, and (b) a fast and accurate algorithm for on-line protein identification using verified peptide

MS/MS spectra. The proposed research will significantly improve the performance of mass spectrometers by

enabling the development of real-time control methodologies based upon the algorithms developed in this

proposal. In providing such advanced methodologies for high-throughput identification of proteins and protein

biomarkers, this project will also make a major contribution to Canadian health research, while promoting

"The proposed research consists of three sub-projects, all of them are applications of ozone technology:



1. Heterogeneous Catalytic Ozonation of Selected Industrial Wastewaters

This project uses heterogeneous catalysts for ozone treatment of industrial wastewaters. The objective is to accelerate pollutant removal, reduce ozone consumption, and thus cut down the cost significantly.  This project will search for effective catalysts, optimize operating conditions, develop models with characteristics of catalytic ozonation, elucidate reaction mechanism, and design appropriate reactor scheme. In addition, the combined use of heterogeneous catalyst, ozone and ultrasound is proposed. This combination is highly possible to lead to a novel wastewater treatment technology. 

2. Surface Modification of Selected Conventional Polymers by Ozone

This ongoing project uses a novel approach for polymer surface modification, i.e., the aqueous ozonation plus introducing homogeneous catalysts to enhance polymer surface hydrophilicity and to control polymer degradation. Continuation of this research will gain insights into the reaction mechanism and get better control of the modification process, resulting in new applications of conventional polymers in membranes, biosensors and biomaterials.

3. Ozone Pretreatment of Lignocellulosic Biomass for Ethanol Production.

As world energy demand is growing and fossil fuel is inevitably depleting, bioethanol, the alternative energy from renewable source, becomes increasingly important. This research proposes the combined use of two environmentally benign methods, ozonation and ultrasonic technology, for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass to enhance ethanol production.  This work is the first of its kind, and it will contribute significantly to the solutions of world energy crisis.

"Ovomucin comprises about ~ 3.5% of total egg white proteins but is the primary contributor to the gel-like nature of egg white. In addition to its excellent gelling and emulsifying properties, ovomucin has been reported to have antivirus, antitumor, and cholesterol-lowering activities. Moreover, as a rich source of sialic acid, ovomucin can be developed as infant dietary supplement for improving brain development and learning ability. Utilization of this protein, however, has been hampered due to the lack of an efficient method of extraction of highly purified ovomucin. A novel method of ovomucin extraction (provisional patent applied) producing purities greater than 90%, compared to less than 70% by the conventional methods, has been developed at the principal investigator's laboratory. In the new method, egg white was first extracted in the presence of 100 mM NaCl at pH 6.0 to produce a precipitate containing moderate co-precipitated ovalbumin (14.6%) and lysozyme (15.9%); the contaminated proteins in the precipitate were further removed by using 500 mM NaCl. Yield of ovomucin extraction by the new method was 400.2 mg/100 g of egg white which was significantly higher than the conventional method of extraction. In the project, conditions of ovomucin extraction will be optimized in order to improve the extraction efficiency and scale-up experiments will be performed to facilitate the demobilization of the technology for industry application. Results from the project will be part of a patent treaty cooperation application to protect the intellectual property. The project will train highly qualified personnel. Success of the project will help Canadian egg industry maintain high competitiveness by providing a superior quality product, diversify the use of eggs, and foster bio-based sustainable growth of the industry through the transformation of the Canadian egg industry from its traditional focus on table eggs and food applications to a far more lucrative one based on bio-product development.","Extraction of ovomucin from laying hen eggs white","Agriculture and primary food production",CANADA,CANADA,"Food chemistry and analysis"
"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and disability in Canada and other developed countries. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is responsible for the onset and progression of many forms of these diseases. Conventional antioxidant strategy targeting overall ROS scavenging has been extensively explored as a means of cardiovascular disease intervention, but the results of many large-scale clinical trials have been disappointing. Compared with the scavenging approach, prevention of ROS formation is believed to be a far more effective strategy. Vascular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase is the predominant source of ROS formation in vascular cells, and represents a major target for cardiovascular disease intervention. Exploration of NADPH oxidase inhibitory peptides will provide a unique approach to chronic disease intervention at the early stages by targeting the source of ROS formation. Over the past two decades, researchers have shown that food protein-derived bioactive peptides have vast potential for improving human health. However, there is a lack of scientific rationale for designing optimum conditions for producing bioactive peptides. By linking the knowledge of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and bioinformatics, the proposed research program attempts to establish a scientific rationale for producing the most desirable NADPH-oxidase inhibitory peptides from hen egg proteins. QSAR is an approach to understanding how structural variation affects the biological activity of a set of compounds, while bioinformatics applies computer technology to analyze biological information. New peptides will be purified from egg protein hydrolysates and characterized. The inhibitory kinetics of peptides against this enzyme and the effects of inhibitory peptides on the assembly of enzyme sub-units will be determined. The resulting scientific rationale will have broad applications in bioactive peptide studies, and will facilitate the course of discovering new health-promoting bioactive peptides from food proteins.

"User-controlled optical networks have flexibility of composing application-specific transport networks and using network resources from different suppliers. Each user independently owns and manages some network resources. A group of users can compose application-specific transport networks. The end-to-end connections between the users in the group are established in a fully distributed, peer-to-peer manner. There is no centralized network management authority to coordinate such end-to-end connection establishment. The management architecture of peer-to-peer optical networks is dramatically different than the existing centralized optical network management architectures.

     This research is to explore the potentials of peer-to-peer technologies in the context of optical network management. Our research goal is to explore the technologies that enable to search optical network resources in a peer-to-peer manner, just as searching for music files. By taking into account the special requirements and characteristics of optical networks, we will customerize the existing peer-to-peer technologies for the management of peer-to-peer optical networks. Such technologies include discovery of group members, search of available network resources offered by group members, communications between group members, granting and receiving the resource management privileges, etc.

     We plan to compare the economics and availability of peer-to-peer optical networks with those of carrier managed optical networks. By economics analysis of peer-to-peer optical networks, we want to reveal the benefits of user centric network management, when they take advantage of the diversity and competitions between carriers. The availability of peer-to-peer optical networks is different than that in a single carrier network. Although individual network resource may not be highly available, peer-to-peer optical networks enjoy massive redundancy of similar network resources and therefore potentially offer highly available services.

My main research interest focuses on semiparametric models of general form and its application in different areas. Many authors have considered efficient and adaptive estimation in semiparametric models for the past twenty years. However, the robustness in semiparametric models has been paid little attention. In this proposal, I am proposing to develop robust estimators in semiparametric models that are efficient. This proposed research plan includes: theoretical development of efficient robust estimators in semiparametric models of general form; efficient robust estimators in two-sample semiparametric models; efficient robust estimators in semiparametric regression models; and robust tests for semiparametric models. 



One of the practical deficiencies of maximum likelihood estimators is the lack of robustness, while many robust estimators achieve robustness at some cost in first-order efficiency. This is, however, not the case with minimum Hellinger distance (MHD) estimators. My proposed research will mainly concentrate on the statistics based on Hellinger distance.



This proposed study is a further improvement of the work initiated during my PhD study on MHD estimation in semiparametric models. I am concerned with the construction of robust estimators of the parametric component in semiparametric models, with the efficiency retained. There are mainly three stages involved in this study: 1) theoretical development of efficient robust estimators in semiparametric models of general form; 2) weaken the sufficient conditions for constructing efficient robust estimators in specific applications concerned; and 3) application of semiparametric tests.

"This 3-year research strategic proposal is concerned with the research and development of millimetre-wave

(mmW) highly integrated transceivers at 60 GHz using the applicant's pioneered concept of substrate integrated

circuit (SIC) for a wide range of broadband wireless applications. Research activities consist of the

investigation and design of innovative components and antennas using two basic SIC structures, namely,

substrate integrated waveguide and substrate integrated dielectric image guide. A low-cost micro-fabrication

technique called photoimageable process is deployed for the first time in Canada, and it is used to develop

dual-antenna conventional and six-port substrate integrated transceivers with multi-chip module techniques.

This research allows the applicant to lead international efforts in searching for future highly integrated mmW

transceiver architectures for broadband communication systems and sensing applications. The research is

conducted for discovering new electrical features, new design rules, and new application areas of the SICs

concept, which involves theoretical and experimental aspects in connection with structure modeling, circuit

design, experimental prototyping and system characterization. This project will provide a worldwide leadership

in the development of future high-density and mass-producible mmW and terahertz circuits and systems with

advanced processing techniques and innovative design platforms. This unique Canadian mmW engineering

research is made possible with highly original approaches developed at the Poly-Grames Research Center. The

project focuses on the emerging industrial needs of mmW-based information and communication technologies

and timely addresses worldwide challenges in competitive mmW and terahertz research. The strategic research

attracts, involves and trains numerous highly qualified personnel to answer the pressing manpower needs of

ICT industries for broadband system development. It also creates unprecedented research and development

opportunities for wireless sensor networks. Research expertise and knowledge generated by this program not

only stimulates corporate growth of the project partners but also spins out new business identities in Canada.","Research and development of millimetre-wave substrate integrated transceiver for broadband wireless","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)",CANADA,CANADA,"Microwave and millimeterwave devices, circuits and technologies"
"The applicant pioneered and has successfully demonstrated the ""substrate integrated circuits (SICs)"" concept for application in future radio-frequency (RF), millimetre-wave and microwave photonic integrated circuits and systems. This 5-year project is concerned with further research and development for demonstrating the uniqueness and usefulness of this possibly revolutionary integrated circuit technique.



This research allows the applicant to lead international efforts in searching for future generations of low cost, high performance and fully integrated circuits and systems. Theoretical and experimental activities will be conducted for discovering new circuit features, new design rules, new innovative devices, and new application areas of the SICs, which will involve unconventional and multilayered substrates. Fundamental guided-wave properties will be investigated for new classes of SICs-based waveguide structures, new modeling and design techniques will be studied and developed with hybrid field/circuit models, and selected experimental prototypes will be made and demonstrated for passive/active circuit and antenna applications. This project will foster substantial interests of this new concept for future high-frequency, in particular millimetre-wave system design towards complete hybrid and monolithic system-on-substrate integration and miniaturization.



The proposed SICs design platform allows bridging the technological gap between high-frequency electronic and photonic circuits and systems. A successful commercialization of such circuits and systems depends on cost/performance and mass-reproducible characteristics. This project promises to provide a valuable edge in meeting this goal. The new knowledge generated from this project and the training of highly qualified personnel will be critical in stimulating the development of Canadian high-technology sectors, thereby enhancing Canada's global competitiveness.","Substrate integrated circuits (SICs) for radio-frequency (RF), millimetre-wave and microwave photonic system applications","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)",CANADA,CANADA,"Microwave and millimeterwave devices, circuits and technologies"

"This project aims to study the impact of perception-based computing model on the lower-layer networking design and to obtain efficient networking solutions to support intelligent applications with wireless sensor networks (WSNs), including for example greenhouse control, environmental and natural resource monitoring and management, and ""smart homes"" to aid seniors' daily lives.



Recent progress in wireless communication and Micro-ElectroMechanical System (MEMS) makes it feasible to build tiny wireless sensor nodes that integrate sensors, processors, memory, and wireless transceivers within the size of several cube centimeters. Such tiny sensor nodes, when clustered together, automatically create highly flexible, low-power wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with numerous new applications ranging from environment monitoring and building control systems to smart entertainment devices that adjust audio and video quality based on changing environments. Many applications with WSNs require human interaction and perception, for example, a sensor-based intelligent entertainment system that provides good audio/video quality to audience, a sensor-guided navigation system that provides useful information to visitors, an unmanned aerial vehicle based on visual perception and environmental feedback, a home control system that supports comfortable living conditions. In these systems, rational decisions have to be made in an environment of imprecision and uncertainty. The computational theory of perception has become a useful tool in perception-based reasoning and has been applied in many application areas. Very little research, however, has investigated how the perception-based computing model at the application layer impacts and guides the network design at the lower layers, e.g., resource allocation, data processing, sensor scheduling, and routing. This project is to fill the vacancy by exploring the advantages of perception-based computing model in the network design and resource utilization of WSNs.

"Many new medicines are formulated by using multiple materials to provide patients with optimal therapeutic benefits. For example, once daily tablets are prepared by compressing drug powders with a large amount of polymers and other pharmaceutical additives. The additives, however, would influence water penetration and drug release from the tablets. In our laboratory we are also developing ""intelligent"" devices that can sense disease state thus adjusting the amount of drug given to patients. One of applications of this type of devices is controlling sugar levels in diabetic patients by regulating insulin delivery. In these devices, multicomponents are integrated in one system. To design such a device and once daily tablets with good quality and low cost, we must have thorough understanding of the properties of polymers and their interaction with other ingredients and solvent and have powerful computational tools for prediction of the performance of the tablets or the devices. However, prediction of molecular mechanism and drug release kinetics in such systems by modeling remains in the infant stage so far, which hinders the development of new pharmaceutical products for patients' need and reduction in the cost of health care. This project is thus proposed to investigate molecular mechanism of polymer dynamics and kinetics of solute transport (1) in polymer gels; (2) in heterogeneous swellable polymer matrices; (3) in environment-responsive polymeric composite membranes; and (4) to model and simulate solute transport in heterogeneous polymer systems. The polymer matrices will be prepared by casting mixtures of polymers and additives in a mold.  The interaction of polymers with additives and solvents will be studied with various modern techniques including thermal and fluorescence analyses, molecular imaging and atomic force microscopy. The dynamics of polymer swelling, dissolution and drug diffusion will be evaluated by optical, electronic and infra-red microscopy, and laser scanning image analysis. The diffusion kinetics of a solute will be determined using a dissolution apparatus. Mathematical model will be developed and computer simulation will be performed to analyze the underlying mechanism and to predict drug release kinetics.

"I propose a theoretical research program on disks, focusing on three inter-related subjects: disks in which planets are to be formed (gaseous proto-planetary disks), disks in which planets have formed and in which residual planetesimals are being cleared away (dusty debris disks), and disks around planets out of which moons are formed (rocky planetary disks). 



The scientific motivation for this study is to answer the following key questions: how do proto-planetary disks dissipate? what are the evolutionary consequences for disks around binary stars? what can the observations of debris disks tell us about the past and future of planetary systems? how does evolution of debris disks in binary systems differ from that around single stars?  how are planets/moons formed in rocky disks and what can we learn about the primordial Kuiper belt?



I study planets both inside and outside the solar system, and the long-term goal of my research is to determine the most important physical processes that lead to the diversity of planetary systems, and to place the solar system in context.

"A statistical model is convenient for representing the observed phenomenon. It contributes to the understanding of the structure of a system or a process in various fields of engineering and natural and social sciences. One of the most important tasks in statistics is to develop methodologies and theories for constructing a statistical model based on data, which is an approximation to the reality manifested in the observed data. Such a model is not unique in general. For a given set of competing models, the key issue is then how to choose the best approximating model among them. After a model is chosen, statistical analysis may be performed. 



It is noted that the underlying distribution of data may not be as assumed and the data are subject to error from various sources. In this data-rich era, data often contain many observations and variables. Since verifying the quality of a large dataset is a formidable task and is hardly  done by manual inspection, there are great needs to develop robust model selection procedures and robust modelling techniques. A statistical procedure is robust if it is resistant to outliers and stable in respect to deviations from a given distributional model. Many robust statistical procedures have been developed so far. M-estimation based procedures play important and complementary roles in the development of robust procedures.



On the basis of current research trend on M-estimation, model selection and modelling, the following topics have been identified to be of great interests for future study: the M-estimation or other robust estimation based procedures for data with complex structure and/or high dimensionality in statistical modelling; changepoint analysis; regime-switching models; the applications of the general results on model selection and M-estimation in signal processing and multivariate survival analysis.

"The behavior of molecular materials depends on the individual properties of the constituent molecules, as well as on collective effects determined by the way in which the components are positioned. Learning how to control local and long-range order is therefore an important prerequisite for engineering new molecular materials. Molecular organization is normally governed by the combined effect of many weak intermolecular interactions, making predictions of structure and properties inherently unreliable. Our goal is to develop and exploit a new way to control molecular organization, based on the recognition that 1) certain groups of atoms can engage in interactions that are particularly strong, directional, and reliable; and 2) such groups can be incorporated in molecules to program how they are positioned with respect to their neighbors. Initial work has shown that this strategy provides an effective way to position molecules both in two dimensions (such as in layers deposited on surfaces) and in three dimensions (such as in bulk materials). Further development of the strategy promises to make an important contribution to basic science and to have valuable applications in technology, particularly as a source of well-organized thin films for use in improved solar cells and other new molecular electronic devices.

"My research group is focused on the synthesis of complex molecules that inhibit, activate, or detect protein-protein interactions. Ultimately, the tools we create in the laboratory will lead to the development of entirely new classes of medicines to treat cancer, HIV/AIDS, and a host of other diseases. 



The human genome contains around 25,000 genes which encode approximately 100,000 proteins. To a large extent, humankind's ability to create effective new medicines may be equated with our ability to design (or find in Nature) molecules which bind to proteins and control their function.



Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions. The traditional ""lock-and-key"" approach to medicinal chemistry involves building molecules that fit inside an enzyme's active site, blocking access to the enzyme's natural substrate and inhibiting the particular biochemical pathway required for progression of a disease. Closely related strategies involve creating molecules that bind at a different point on the protein's three-dimensional surface and either increase or decrease access to the active site. 



Many proteins exert their function by taking part in the formation of multi-protein complexes. Certain protein-protein complexes are implicated in the progression of specific diseases (cancer, HIV, malaria, etc.) of widespread importance. Unfortunately, there has been limited progress in developing molecules that selectively block the formation of undesirable protein complexes. In my group, we will develop new classes of molecules that selectively disrupt certain key protein-protein interactions, even in cases where the individual proteins lack a traditional enzyme active site. Some of our molecules will be based upon compounds isolated from Nature, while others will be designed by us for a specific purpose.

"Electrochemical discharges are known since more than 150 years as a undesirable phenomenon in electrochemical industry. Its only since the end of last century that the heat produced by them is used for micro-machining applications, in particular for glass micro-machining. In the present research, the filed of application of electrochemical discharges in the micro- and nano-system technology will be increased by taking advantage of the electrons carried by the discharges to produce locally electrochemical reactions. Applications are local modification of glass by doping it with various chemicals with the target to achieve local electrical conductivity and localized reduction of metal ions in solution for nano-particle fabrication.



One of the benefits of this novel technology is the possibility to obtain various chemical composition and even alloys for nano-particles. One of the research focus is on the production of interesting alloys of nano-particles to be used as catalysts in fuel-cells. An other research target is to micro-machine diamond with application in the field of boron doped diamond electrodes for wastewater treatment and analytical purposes.

"The synergistic interaction of malnutrition with infections is a complex multifactorial problem with devastating impact worldwide. Inflammation and activation of the immune system, which are both normal responses to tissue injury and infection, result in 1) increased synthesis of glutathione (GSH) to balance the increased production of free radicals and 2) increased synthesis of acute phase proteins. Both responses result in increased demands for a potentially meagre supply of amino acids. During malnutrition these responses may further compromise growth and may be compromised themselves. Our new stable isotope techniques to measure tissue protein synthesis as well as synthesis of GSH and individual plasma proteins allow comprehensive examination of the mechanisms of how pools of individual proteins or products of amino acids are maintained, augmented or depleted in states of malnutrition and/or oxidative stress. 

We have developed a model of colitis or inflammation of the gut first in the piglet to represent the child and now in the guinea pig to represent the adult. We now aim to move from a macronutrient restricted nutrition model to focus on how specific dietary nutrients modulate inflammation and ultimately affect nutritional status. We will investigate how protein deficiency compromises protein metabolism and function of the gut in the piglet. In the guinea pig we will study the role of the anti-inflammatory omega3 fatty acid DHA in inflammation, leukotriene inflammatory mediators and the acute phase response. We will investigate the role of cysteine in reducing oxidative damage, stimulating tissue repair, and in protein synthesis. Our new multiple stable isotope tracer protocol (L-[ring2H5]phenylalanine and [15N,13C2]glycine) will allow us to target synthesis rates of specific proteins (including albumin and metallothionein, both notably high in cysteine), peptides (GSH) and metabolic regulators (leukotrienes). Results are expected to show HOW adaptations to malnutrition are affected, and to underscore the importance of diet and nutritional status in maintaining a healthy digestive system and in mounting effective responses to stresses.","Protein and amino acid metabolism in malnutrition and metabolic stress","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal physiology and metabolism"
"This proposal outlines a broad research program aimed at understanding neural pathways underling sensory, perceptual and cognitive processes. The research is comparative in nature, using birds as a model, and involves several techniques including neuronal recording, neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, and behavioural testing. Overall there are two major objectives. The first objective is to determine the physiological, and neuroanantomical organization of pathways in the brain that process ""Optic Flow"". Optic flow refers to the visual motion across the entire retina resulting from self-motion, and it is detected by the brain and used to control eye movements, posture and locomotion. In this proposal we will examine how the visual pathways are connected with the motor areas in the brain that directly control the eyes, head and limbs. We will also record from neurons in these pathways to determine how they process complex patterns of optic flow and determine the neurotransmitters used for communication between neurons in these pathways. This research is important because it will reveal the pathways in the brain that allow us to use vision to control posture and locomotion, behaviors that are critical for our survival. It is applicable to medical science as there are many clinical conditions that involve damage to these pathways, such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. The second objective is to understand the evolution of brain-behaviour relationships in birds using a comparative approach. We have begun studying brain-behaviour relationships among birds by amassing the largest and most diverse collection of avian brains in the world. We will use this collection to determine how the brain evolved with changes in sensory abilities such as vision and hearing, as well as changes in complex motor skills such as tool use. This research is important because it reveals how the brain evolved as bird species began changing their behaviour to adapt to changes in the environment. The general principles we learn from this research will significantly increase our understanding of brain-behaviour relationships, the evolution of the human brain, and advanced cognitive processes.

"As evolutionary endocrinologists, we are experts in the precise measurement of hormones in biological fluids such as saliva and blood and egg yolk. These skills support student projects as diverse as hormone involvement in adolescent onset depression, testosterone variability in aging men, hormonal changes in men becoming fathers, chronic and acute responses to stress, trans-generational effects of maternal stress on development of embryos, and hormone dynamics within individuals. Understanding hormone dynamics within individuals is the focus of this proposal, with experiments that obtain up to 24 small samples from one individual and then calculate the hormonal variability that the individual experiences from day to day. In spite of our new methods that provide tight experimental controls and small measurement error, we find that repeated sampling reveals huge variability. Within one male hamster, for example, testosterone concentrations fall anywhere between a low of 20 and a high of 2000 ng/dL over 24 repeated samples. Variability is also large in men, women, and adolescent girls, whether measured for sex hormones or for stress hormones. In addition, we have preliminary evidence that our measure of variability, the dynamic index, can change at critical transitions in life, such as becoming a father, and in response to lifestyle choices, such as exercise and diet. Coding information in concentration, and in dynamic variability around that concentration, would enable one hormone to carry two independent messages. Thus, proposed research will test our hypothesis that hormone variability, or 'noise', contains a hormone 'signal'. If the hypothesis is supported, our results will transform future experimental designs, bridge missing links between hormones and behaviour, and, eventually, might lead to changes in hormone delivery that reduce health risks.

"One of the most obvious environmental changes caused by humans is the alteration of the landscape. Usually this involves the reduction of forested cover at the expense of agricultural and urban areas. Almost inevitably, these changes in land use affect water quality and quantity in surface and subsurface waters because of altered connections between the land and water. For rivers in these landscapes, modified connections mean that organic matter (generally measured in carbon unites as dissolved organic carbon, DOC) originates primarily from agricultural crops, manure and urban waste instead of natural vegetation, soils and wetlands. This 'modified' DOC can have large implications for the healthy functioning of our rivers. In this project, I will examine how the DOC changes in quality and quantity in river watersheds of contrasting land use from the Great Lakes Basin in South-central Ontario. My research program will further investigate the cause and effect relationships among the physical and biological processes that define river structure and production. I will examine important biological, chemical, and physical factors that change with DOC. I will further test how agriculturally and urban-derived DOC and nutrients affects bacterial growth, food webs and several ecosystem functions such as decomposition, nutrient uptake and the cycling of nitrogen. Finally, I will test for riverine DOC responses to climate change because these might be affected by periods of warm weather and drought. This research will help us understand how human-derived materials (agricultural and residential waste) will affect the health and integrity of aquatic communities.","Variation of stream dissolved organic carbon quantity, character and ecosystem function in a changing landscape",Water,CANADA,CANADA,"Aquatic ecology and limnology"

"Modular Reconfigurable Machines (MRMs) represent a paradigm shift in the history of machines, because they are able to rearrange their modules and change their structures according to environment and task requirements. Although a number of MRMs have been developed around the world, they are still controlled by methods previously developed for traditional machines, but recently adapted to MRMs on a case-by-case basis. When the MRM changes its configuration, all equations, including kinematics, dynamics, kinetostatics, and calibration, must be derived all over again. Therefore, new theory must be developed in order to deal with the varying topological nature of MRMs. In this proposed research, the objective is to develop a module-based theory for effective analysis and control of MRMs. This research includes five components. The first component is module modeling in which the modules of MRMs will be classified in terms of the number and combinations of motion axes, and then a method will be developed to model the connectivity between adjacent modules. The second component is kinematic modeling in which a module-fixed coordinate frame will be used for each type of modules, and a zero-reference plane method will be used to unify the kinematic representation of all modules with respect to the global coordinate frames. The third component is system modeling in which transformation functions will be developed between adjacent modules, including pose/twist (motion), wrench (force), deformation and error, and then these transformation functions will be embedded in the module function blocks, which will be created to automatically generate the system equations for various analyses and controls of MRMs. The fourth component is configuration optimization in which both an enumeration method and Generic Algorithms (GA)-based method will be developed to search for an optimal configuration of a MRM for given task requirements. The last component is industrial applications in which two types of MRMs will be studied, one being modular reconfigurable machine tools (MRMTs) and the other being modular reconfigurable robots (MRRs), with applications to manufacturing and aerospace.

"The proposed research program is designed to study late transition metal-catalyzed functionalizations of alkenes, which are important chemical processes in both academic and industrial settings.  The efficiency of these types of processes is greatly influenced by the nature of ancillary ligands to the metal centers.  Therefore it is critical to design and employ ligands that can be easily tuned to meet specific electronic and steric demand.



Specifically, the program is aimed at palladium catalyzed alkene oxidation (such as Wacker reaction) whose mechanism is still a topic of debate after many years of investigation.  The scope of the ligands in alkene oxidation chemistry is rather limited as many common organic ligands are oxidized or decomposed under oxidizing conditions.  The work focuses on the rational design, synthesis, characterization and application of novel bidentate and/or potentially hemilabile ligands such as iminophosphinites and their chalcogenides.  These ligands can be prepared from readily available starting materials such as aminophenol and salicylaldehyde.  The ligands contain both hard (N or O) and soft (P, S, or Se) donors which interact with metal centers differently and may lead to improved catalytic properties.  The relationship between the reactivity of platinum and palladium complexes and the choice of iminophosphinites and chalcogenides will be systematically investigated.  The study will enhance the understanding of mechanisms in important chemical processes, thus allow the design and synthesis of more efficient catalytic systems.  It will also provide an excellent opportunity for the training of undergraduate students with important synthetic and analytical skills.

"For decades, the silicon (Si) based semiconductor industry has been crucial to drawing the broad outlines of the modern history of economics and technology. In the past decade, however, the ever increasing demands on performance enhancement have pushed Si to its physical limits. The introduction of silicon germanium (SiGe) and stress to previously unstrained Si devices is promising to solve this dilemma, which boost device performance significantly while taking advantage of the existing large scale Si manufacture infrastructure. Moreover, Si and Ge based photonic devices hold the potential to improve the speed of on-chip data transmission and long distance communications by orders of magnitudes. Despite its rapid development in the last decade, the application of SiGe and stress technology brings integration challenges such as SiGe interdiffusion, dopant diffusion and activation, stress distribution and relaxation. These issues degrade device performance and make the product development process complicated, time-consuming and costly. The proposed research is to address these challenges.



In this research, we aim to understand SiGe compatibility with Si (i.e. interdiffusion, dopant diffusion and activation), which is crucial for SiGe device structure design, dopant introduction, and thermal processing. In addition, stress enhancement mechanisms and limits will be studied to provide key knowledge for the design of stressor structures and strength. Finally, stress simulations and modeling for advanced stress techniques will help resolving the controversy on the mechanisms behind reverse embedded SiGe structure and reveal the stress generation and transfer process of in-plane bonding technique. The outcome of this research will see its applications in building better performance computers and much higher speed communication networks.

"Due to its brittle nature, rock breaks at all length scales: from micro-cracks in grains (or along grain boundaries) with sizes smaller than a millimeter to huge earthquake ruptures along faults that define tectonic boundaries with lengths of hundreds of kilometers.  Fractures and fracture processes play an important role in the determination of the constitutive response of rocks and the characteristics of geological hazards that are associated with catastrophic rock faults.  Thus, the investigation of fractures in rocks will help us understand and mitigate geological hazards (seismic, landslide, etc.), address safety issues in mines (e.g., slope instability, rockbursts), and improve the management of groundwater and radioactive waste.  Historically, research efforts to understand rock fractures have been focused mainly on laboratory static fractures and on the seismic observations and numerical simulations of earthquakes.  In order to understand the dynamic properties of rocks involved in catastrophic failures, specially designed experiments are necessary.  Following the applicant's earlier work in the laboratory earthquake experiments and spontaneous fracture experiments, he will study the characteristics of earthquake faulting in both two- and three-dimensions.  The applicant will also systematically measure the dynamic fracture toughness of rocks and the dynamic tensile strength of rocks, two important parameters in the quantification of dynamic rock failure.  The research will be carried out using the Rock Dynamic Fracture Facility (CFI-Young lead PI) at the University of Toronto, the high speed camera, and the gas gun through collaboration.  In addition, the applicant is building a gas gun using the start-up award from the University of Toronto and is preparing a CFI/LOF proposal to request an ultra high speed camera.



The proposed research will provide an exceptional opportunity for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers working in the area of rock physics and will, therefore, contribute to the development and training of HQP in Canada.

"This proposal is for a two and half year research program focusing on damage analysis and long term reliability evaluation of delayed coke drums - primary equipment associated with the processing of oil sand bitumen. The service lives of current coke drums are limited due to severe thermal-mechanical load experienced. Through tightly-coupled experimental investigation, theoretical modeling and FEM numerical simulation, a thorough understanding of the initiation and propagation of damage in coke drums will be obtained. A more reliable life estimation methodology will be developed, as well as the proposal of enhancements to delay the damage and to prolong lives of coke drums.

Unprecedented investments in oil sands are currently occurring in Western Canada. The primary technology of coke drums has remained essentially the same since its introduction in the 1940's. It is critical that this equipment provide long term reliability to suit today's economy and labor-challenged environment. The benefit of the successful completion of this proposed research to industrial users is to construct more robust new equipment and to remediate existing equipment. Overall, this research will improve the profitability of the Canadian industry, free up labor demands and advance knowledge of the technology.

"Plasma is an ionized gas with free electrons, ions, and neutral particles. Fusion has been considered an ultimate energy solution which is also friendly to environment. Tokamak is a device to confine plasma using magnetic field. Pursues to build commercial fusion reactor are hindered by anomalous transport of heat and particles in the reactor. Instabilities and turbulences are the main candidates for causing anomalous transport, but the exact mechanism is still largely unknown. In this research, the improved confinement phase induced by various techniques in the STOR-M tokamak will be studied. 

      One of the technical issues surround fusion reactors is the means to deliver fuels to the core of a high temperature reactor. Present fueling technology based on accelerated frozen pellet of hydrogen may not be the best choice since the pellets will be melted, vaporized, and ionized at the periphery of the reactor. University of Saskatchewan has pioneered research on compact torus (CT) injection into tokamaks as a new fueling technology. The proposed research will further study the interactions between the CT and tokamak plasmas. A repetitive CT injector will also be constructed since the future reactor will be operated in a steady state mode. 

      Research on fusion plasmas is also related to some extent to the plasma aided material processing.  At the edge of a tokamak, plasma density and temperature are relatively low. Techniques used for diagnosing edge plasma parameters in tokamaks can also be used for processing plasmas. 

      Since termination of the Canadian national fusion program and the closure of the TdeV tokamak in 1997, the STOR-M tokamak has been the only magnetic fusion research facility in Canada. The ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is the largest scientific project participated in by seven parties (EU, USA, Japan, Russia, China, Korea, and India. Unfortunately, Canada is now the only G8 country outside the ITER program. It is important for Canada to maintain a small, yet important fusion research program on STOR-M which has been vibrant and visible to the international fusion community.

"The interaction between harmonic analysis and partial differential equations (PDE) has a long history going back to the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation. Nowadays, a fruitful ground for the interplay is the study of various aspects of PDE. With special emphasis on the geometric capacity-measure theory approach, this proposed research program will be centered about the boundary between the above two core areas via the Cauchy problem for the linear-nonlinear heat equations. Particular topics to be investigated include:



* Spacetime estimates for the parabolic Riesz type potentials and capacities generated by solutions to the inhomogeneous heat equations.

* Wellposedness of the nonlinear heat equations such as the semilinear dissipative, dissipative quasi-geostrophic, and generalized Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.

* Carleson type measures versus Riesz type capacities through a priori estimations of solutions to the homogeneous heat and Schroedinger equations in terms of the initial data.

* Function-theoretic and/or operator-theoretic characterizations of various function spaces associated to the heat semigroup operators.

* Sharp geometric and/or analytic inequalities (e.g. the capacitary Brunn-Minkowski and logarithmic Sobolev estimates) related to the convexity of potentials and some dissipative equations.



The principle ideas and techniques will involve developing some geometric features of harmonic analysis over function spaces and their operators, building on many significant advances in complex-harmonic analysis, operator-potential theory, and convex geometry made in the last decades by a number of people. It is expected that this research will provide useful tools for the field of evolution equations and convex geometric analysis.

"The SOS response was first discovered in bacteria as a means of tolerating environmental radiation and genotoxic chemicals. No similar phenomenon has yet been observed in eukaryotes; however, genome-wide analyses have identified a large number of yeast genes whose expression increases in response to DNA damage. My laboratory aims to understand molecular mechanisms of transcriptional response to DNA damage using yeast as a model. Supported by NSERC, we found that several yeast genes are regulated by a common pathway with features reminiscent of the bacterial SOS system. However, unlike bacterial SOS, yeast cells appear to utilize ubiquitination and phosphorylation systems to modify target proteins involved in sensing DNA damage and relaying signals. We recently made a highly significant discovery regarding the signal transduction leading to transcriptional response and cell cycle control, and convincingly demonstrated a regulatory mechanism similar to the bacterial SOS response. It also becomes clear through our study that not all DNA damage inducible genes share the same promoter elements and that they probably belong to several distinct groups (regulons). Here we propose both genome-wide screens and detailed molecular analyses of selected genes aiming at understanding how several hundred genes are coordinately regulated in response to DNA damage at the transcriptional level. Elucidation of these signal transduction cascades has three important implications. First, it helps us to uncover fundamental biological processes of gene regulation and development, a key process of life. Second, DNA damage is the leading cause of human genetic diseases including cancer, and the vast majority (>90%) of chemical carcinogens are DNA damaging agents. We have utilized the above knowledge to develop a genotoxicity test capable of detecting and assessing environmental carcinogens. Finally, we have found that all the regulatory genes in this proposed study are highly conserved within eukaryotes, from yeast to human. Hence, our proposed studies can be applied to multicellular organisms, and contribute to agriculture, the environment and public health.","A eukaryotic SOS response","Medical and health sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Gene regulation"

"The Arctic Ocean receives the largest input of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) on a per unit volume basis. Currently, little is known of the processes controlling the transformation and fate of this DOM pool. Mid- and low-latitude studies suggest that sunlight-initiated photochemistry in the surface ocean likely play an important role in processing terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by directly oxidizing DOM to small inorganic carbon molecules (e.g., CO2 and CO) and by labilizing biologically refractory DOM to bacterial metabolic attack. Phototransformation of DOM may also affect the nitrogen cycling by directly converting biologically resistant dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to bioavailable inorganic nitrogen (e.g., ammonium, nitrite) and/or through enhancing bacterial demand for inorganic nutrients. The impact of photochemistry on terrestrial DOM cycling in Arctic and subarctic oceans has been assumed to be insignificant due to low solar angles and extensive seasonal and year-round ice cover. However, this may change as a consequence of climate warming and stratospheric ozone reduction that are possible already occurring over the high northern latitudes. Climate warming reduces ice cover extent and ice thickness while stratospheric ozone reduction increases the ultraviolet radiation reaching the sea surface; the combination of the two hence augments the solar radiation penetrating into the water column. By conducting three field surveys in Arctic (Mackenzie Shelf and Lena Delta) and subarcitc (Hudson Bay) seas, this proposed research is aimed at (1) quantitatively evaluating the impacts of photochemistry on the fate of terrestrial DOC and on inorganic nitrogen cycling in Arctic and subarctic marine ecosystems, and (2) predicting how climate warming and stratospheric ozone reduction over these regions affect these impacts.","The impact of dissolved organic matter photochemistry on the carbon and nutrient cycling in arctic and subarctic marine ecosystems","Oceans, seas and estuaries",CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical oceanography"

"Many structural failures or system malfunctions occur as a result of dynamic instability, e.g. the collapse of Tacoma-Narrows bridge, and machine-tool chatter. Loadings imposed on structures often consist of random forces, such as those arising from earthquakes, wind, and ocean waves. Under the action of such loadings, the parameters describing the motion of a structure will fluctuate in a stochastic manner. The response of the structure is governed by stochastic differential equations. Parametric instability or resonance is characterized by exponential growth of the response amplitudes, even in the presence of damping. 



Investigations of stability under parametric stochastic excitation have become increasingly important. The modern theory of stochastic stability is founded on Lyapunov and moment Lyapunov exponents. Moment Lyapunov exponent is recognized as an ideal avenue for studying the behaviour of a dynamical system.



Determination of moment Lyapunov exponents is in general very difficult. In the proposed research, continued efforts will be made to develop new analytical methods for determining the moment Lyapunov exponents of stochastic dynamic systems, especially for viscoelastic systems, systems with delay, gyroscopic systems, and higher-dimensional systems. For most practical engineering structures, numerical approaches have to be applied. The proposed research will continue the effort in developing accurate and efficient numerical algorithms for the determination of moment Lyapunov exponents.



The proposed research will provide a better understanding of the dynamic and stability behaviour of structures. This work will impact on the reliability and safety analysis and design of structures and engineering systems, such as bridges, rotating shafts, heat exchangers, high-speed machinery, aircraft and marine applications.

"How do infants and young children learn about the world?  What are the learning mechanisms available early in development and how do they change over time?  Do different domains have different learning mechanisms, e.g., learning about objects may be different from learning about  people?  The proposed research focuses on how infants and young children make statistical inferences based on the input they receive from the environment. Recent research from our laboratory suggests that 8-month-old infants are ""intuitive statisticians"" -- they are able to keep track of the statistical information in a small sample and make guesses about a larger population.  This kind of learning happens in many domains, e.g., children hear a new word used a few times and they generalize the word to objects they have not heard labeled before; children may be taught a new property about an object and they immediately generalize it to other objects of the same kind; children may also learn a new fact about a person and generalize it to other people of the same gender or age group.  We aim to further understand how these learning mechanisms operate in early childhood, and we hope that the research will help us develop better and more efficient curricular in kindergarten and preschool.

"Following on the successful use of cold-formed steel framing in low-rise residential, commercial and industrial construction over the past two decades, the application of such thin-walled material for multi-storey structures has gained widespread momentum in North America in recent years. Cold-formed steel provides an efficient and economical structural system which has numerous advantages and benefits with broad applications. Recent advances in construction technology have made it possible to use cold-formed steel members to construct residential and commercial buildings up to nine storeys high in seismic zones. 

A fundamental task in stability and integrity design is to ensure the safety of structures during their construction period and their operational life. The proposed research focuses on developing practical and advanced approaches for assessing the stability and integrity of two types of cold-formed steel structures; namely, cold-formed steel storage racks and mid-rise cold-formed steel framed buildings. The importance of the research is that it will provide crucial information concerning the stability and integrity of structures that is generally not available through analysis guidelines specified in current design standards. The major results of the research will enhance the life-safety performance of the structures, including improved protection against catastrophic collapse in the event of devastating unforeseeable hazards. Canadians and people elsewhere in the world will benefit from having significantly safer building environments in which to live and work.

The proposed research will create valuable training opportunities for a number of graduate and undergraduate students to become specialized in the design of cold-formed steel structures, an area in which there is currently a considerable shortage of design professionals. Through analytic and computer simulations, experimental tests and interaction with practitioners, this research will develop highly qualified personnel with the skills required to address technical and social challenges of significant importance to the life safety and property of Canadians.

"One of the fascinating current questions in molecular and biological physical chemistry is the mechanism of protein folding. What are the energetics and the dynamics of the motions of these large biomolecules? To seek insights, we will undertake high-resolution spectroscopic study of biomimetics at UNB and the FIR beamline at the CLS synchrotron in Saskatoon. Biomimetics are medium-sized molecules which mimic the structures and internal motions of subunits of larger biomolecules, providing windows into the folding behaviour and torsional flexibility of the larger parents. We will study the weak torsional fundamentals at the CLS taking advantage of the bright synchrotron source, and we will probe bending and stretching vibrations of the heavy-atom molecular backbones in-house at UNB to exploit these modes as ""doorway"" states to couple to and give information about the torsion. Using complementary experimental and ab-initio approaches, we aim to explore (i) the number, shape and energy of different molecular conformations, (ii) barriers to folding, and (iii) tunneling pathways, features all directly related to the folding structures in peptide chains. Our second area of research deals with the complex interactions between vibrations and torsion in smaller molecules such as methanol. Here, we are analyzing the IR absorption bands in order to understand and model the energy structure and intermode coupling, and to provide information to a wide audience of atmospheric and space scientists. Recent observations of methanol in forest fires, the atmosphere and comets have generated a strong demand for database information. Astronomically, methanol is now identified as the worst interstellar ""weed"" with an abundance of strong lines throughout the entire spectrum that interfere with other molecules of interest. A collaboration with the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab on compilation of position and intensity data will fill an important gap in the next version of HITRAN, the international atmospheric database. To further advance the frontiers, we will initiate multi-state global modeling for much improved accuracy and capability for reliable simulation of methanol absorption bands over a wide range of atmospheric and astrochemical conditions.

"Tracking the 3D motion of objects and devices has wide application in medical physics, industrial engineering, biomedical engineering and health care. This proposal is to investigate the fundamental instrumentation physics of a positron emission based motion tracking technique. Currently available motion tracking techniques include optical tracking, electromagnetic tracking and tracking with x-ray imaging. However, each technique has its limitations. The optical method cannot track an object inside a cavity. Due to interference, electromagnetic tracking can produce large tracking error when the transmitter or receiver is placed close to a metallic object. X-ray imaging introduces significant radiation dose. These techniques usually require a minimum size of the markers to provide adequate signal to noise ratios for accurate tracking, which further limits the application of these techniques. The proposed technique labels the target object with positron-emitting isotopes. The emitted positrons annihilate with surrounding electrons and produce pairs of back-to-back gamma rays. By detecting these annihilation gamma rays, the shape, location and orientation of the object can be reconstructed in real-time with sub-millimeter accuracy. The positron isotope can be embedded into or deposited on the target in any form, point source marker, line marker and can even be ""painted"" on the surface of the target device. The activity of isotope for labeling is very low (less than 3MBq) and the radiation dose to the patient and operator is not significant: less than 1 uSv/hr for an operator at 50 cm distance, as compared with 4 mSv annual dose received by an average Canadian. The proposed technique can overcome the above limitations and can track objects that are too small for current techniques. Its flexibility will lead to the emergence of new medical treatment procedures. The work to be funded is to: 1) Develop tracking algorithms for both target motion and shape. 2) Develop isotope labeling techniques for 5 degrees-of-freedom tracking 3) Develop dedicated detector systems to prompt wide application of this technique. 4) Explore possible applications in medicine and engineering.","Instrumentation physics of a novel positron-emission based motion and shape tracking technique for medicine","Medical equipment and apparatus",CANADA,CANADA,"Biological and Medical Physics"
"Lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. Its five year survival rate is only 15%. One of the major reasons for its poor treatment outcome is the low accuracy of radiation delivery due to constant tumor motion caused by respiration. The solution to this problem is to track the location of the tumour accurately and guide the radiation toward the tumour. 

       We are developing a novel tracking technique that uses markers labeled with positron emission isotopes. These markers can be implanted into the tumour or embedded into surgical instruments to track their 3D location in real-time. Positron emission isotopes produce positrons which will annihilate with a local electron and produce a pair of back-to-back gamma rays. By detecting pairs of annihilation gammas, the positions of the positron emission markers can be determined. Our studies have shown that this technique can be used to track multiple point markers within sub-millimeter accuracy. We call this technique ""PeTrack"".  The positron emission isotopes used by PeTrack have shot life time and their activity is only about 1/100 of the activity used in patient positron emission tomography (PET) imaging so the radiation doses to the patient and operator are minimal, which is an advantage as compared with current x-ray based tracking techniques. The implantation of positron emission markers, whose diameter can be as small as 0.5 mm, will be easier than the implantation of the larger markers used in other techniques. PeTrack can also be applied to real-time tracking of interventional catheter and surgical tools for image guided surgery.  We have a pending patent for this technique (U.S. Patent Application No. 11/786,401). 

      The concept of the technique has been tested by simulation and preliminary experiments. The Phase-I research will further evaluate the feasibility of the technique and address the engineering and clinical implementation aspects of the technique to allow further pursuing its commercialization.

"There are accumulating evidence that air pollution leads to adverse human health effects even death. In ambient air, ultrafine particles are particularly harmful. Ultrafine particles are particles with diameters of ~1 nm to 100 nm. The primary man-made sources of ultrafine particles are fuel combustion and formation of secondary particles via chemical reactions of gaseous pollutants. Because of their large surface areas, ultrafine particles

are often coated with metals, free radicals, and other harmful chemicals. Due to their small sizes, they penetrate to the lower parts of the lung causing respiratory disease including allergy, asthma, and lung cancer. Ultrafine particles are not regulatory yet; ambient monitoring of ultrafine particles is sparse due to high cost of instrumentation; and control methods are costly due to their small sizes. However, there are urgent needs of research in the areas of ambient monitoring, exposure assessments, health effects studies, and emissions controls.



A Fast Mobility Particle Sizer Spectrometer (FMPS, TSI Model 3091) is being sought by faculty members in the Dept of Civil and Environmental Engineering (Dr. Xu and Dr. Tam), and the Dept of Mechanical, Automotive and Materials Engineering (Dr. Ting and Dr. Zheng), University of Windsor to support active research programs of formation and dispersion of ultrafine atmospheric particles. The fund being requested will enable the purchase of stand-alone, field deployable equipment capable of measuring the ultrafine particles as small as 6 nm in ambient air or combustion exhaust to support those programs.

"There is growing evidence that air pollution has adverse effects on human health and even causes death. Nationwide, air pollution accounts for thousands of premature deaths annually and the economic cost was $8 billion in 2008. However, the true cost may be higher than these economic costs. To alleviate the adverse effects, it is important to identify the time and place of poor air quality and the source of the air pollutants. A-MAPS Environmental, a Canadian company in Ottawa, has successfully developed a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based air quality mapping and analyzing system. This innovative tool integrates satellite observations, ground level measurements by fixed air quality networks, and geospatial interpolation

and analysis. However, the use of this tool is limited by its spatial resolution of 10 km by 15 km. The objectives of this project are 1) to develop a plume dispersion module which is suitable for a GIS platform, thus to observe spatial distribution of air pollutants from traffic and point sources such as industrial facilities in a neighbourhood scale (i.e. 100 m by 100 m or smaller), and 2) to incorporate this module into A-MAPS' air quality mapping system, thus the concentration field generated by the plume module will feed into the existing interactive Graphical User Interface for mapping, animation and other analysis. The research team in Windsor and A-MAPS bring together a mix of expertise in traffic engineering, air quality monitoring, modelling, visualization and geospatial analysis. This project will help A-MAPS enhance its air quality mapping tools significantly and expand its market. An advanced air quality mapping tool developed in this project will empower all sectors of the society to better understand the sources of air pollution and to make the right decisions to protect our environment, and the health and well being of Canadians.","Integration of a plume dispersion module into an air quality mapping system",Engineering,CANADA,CANADA,"Air and noise pollution"
"The above all goal of air quality management is to protect human health and our environment. Presently, the two missing links are accurate estimation of exposure to air pollutants which establishes a causal relationship with health outcomes, and quantitative identification of source contributions in order to aid development and evaluation of risk reduction strategies. This proposed study will improve our knowledge and assist management decisions through a novel approach integrating all three components: intensive monitoring, emission inventory development, and computer model simulation.



The characterization of intra-urban air quality within the Windsor airshed will be achieved by developing and applying tools of mobile emission and dispersion, and by utilizing data of intensive monitoring.   It will help to evaluate mitigation strategies and alternative transportation routes proposed under the Border Air Quality Strategy.  The finding of the model evaluation and cross-validation will be not only of interest to our local community, but will also be beneficial to the scientific community by improving our understanding of the capabilities of the various methods of air quality modeling.



Furthermore, this research will improve our ability to conduct air quality analyses and exposure assessments on intra-urban scales. The development of local mobile emission tools and the integration of all three types of air quality models enable the capabilities of fine scale resolutions.  The methodologies developed during this research can easily be employed by others in the community because of the use of modeling systems and Canadian traffic data which are familiar to Canadian engineers and scientists.  Thus, this study will provide a useful tool to estimate human exposure and to investigate the source-receptor relationship in local scales, and therefore aid regulatory decision making in reducing the adverse health effects.

"    )	My work focuses on constructing the experimental designs for regression problems. Good designs should lead to small biases in the estimates when the fitted model is incorrect, and should also be efficient (i.e., lead to small variances) in the estimates when the fitted model is in fact correct. I intend to work on the design constructions for the regression problem with a very general setup. The regression responses are considered to be a function of a linear function. We watch for the situation where the fitted model may not exactly represent the truth. Other possible departures from the usual assumptions are also taken into account. Errors may not equally vary as they are assumed, for instance. 



    )	Applications to accelerated life testing (ALT) are explored as well. ALT is the process of determining the lifetime of a product or material with a long lifespan in a relatively short period of time. In order to obtain the failures, the normal use conditions such as voltage, temperature, pressure, and use rate have to be accelerated. An ALT model will be fitted to the data at accelerated levels and the estimates are extrapolated to the normal use levels. The designs constructed are also expected to incorporate censoring schemes and/or stress loading plans for ALT in a good manner.

"Chirality and chiral recognition are ubiquitous in living systems. Our research focuses on characterizing and understanding the phenomena of chirality and chiral recognition using experimental spectroscopic and theoretical methods. The proposal describes our systematic approach to study chirality and chiral recognition: from small chiral molecular contact pairs to small biomolecular aggregates in the gas phase, from the gas phase to the solution phase, and from fundamental research to practical applications. The natural evolution from one research area to the next and the strong synergy among them are emphasized. Currently, we are working in four active research areas united under this central theme.

(1) We will apply jet-cooled high resolution spectroscopy, in combination with ab initio calculations, to quantify the intermolecular forces responsible for chiral recognition. This is an area in which we have had considerable success in the past. We will methodically increase the complexity of the targeted chiral molecular contact pairs to mimic chiral recognition in biological systems.  (2) We will continue to build on our strength and expertise in instrument development with a major collaborative project planned. This ambitious and innovative project will combine IR spectroscopy with mass spectrometry to provide us the means to study chiral recognition effects in small biomolecular aggregates.  (3) To unveil the solvent effects in chiroptical measurements, we will carry out both gas phase studies of stepwise solvation of a chiral molecule and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) investigations of chiral molecules in solution. Extensive theoretical modeling will be used to aid the interpretation of the experimental measurements.  (4) We will utilize the scientific insights and experimental expertise gained to determine absolute configurations of synthetic novel carbohydrates with special biological and pharmaceutical properties, using VCD spectroscopy, together with DFT calculations and molecular dynamics simulations.

"Flotation of fine particles for mineral recovery is a recognized challenge in mining and minerals industry, often leading to low recovery due to low collision and attachment efficiency of fine particles with air bubbles, and poor froth quality mainly by unintentional activation, slime coating and inevitable mechanical entrainment. In literature, high intensity agitation (HIA) under controlled pulp chemistry conditions has found some success for improving fine particle flotation. However, lack of suitable instrumentation in previous studies has limited the progress in fundamental understanding of fine particle flotation systems. In a recent study, we demonstrated that dissolved air played a key role in enhancing the aggregation of hydrophobized fine particles and hence their flotation. Due to limited solubility of air under ambient conditions, the improvement of selective fine particle aggregation was rather limited. To improve fine particle flotation by taking full advantage of dissolved gases, saturating the slurry with a gas of high solubility, such as CO2 or designing a system in which air or CO2 can be continuously introduced into the slurry during HIA is highly desirable. The key gap between the concept and practice is to generate a sufficient number of cavity bubbles in situ selectively on target particles by HIA. To fill this gap, it is essential to understand gas nucleation in a given HIA system. 



The objective of this NSERC-CRD project is to understand for a dynamic flotation system: i) role of impeller design and dissolved gases in the enhancement of hydrodynamic cavitation; ii) role of chemical additives in hydrodynamic cavitation; iii) potential of cavities acting as carrier for fine particle flotation; iv) role of particle hydrophobicity in hydrodynamic cavitation-induced aggregation; and v) nucleation of fine bubbles in the presence of fine particles. The fundamental understanding and successful implementation of hydrodynamic cavitation assisted by gas saturation are anticipated to enhance fine particle flotation in the mineral processing industry and extend natural resource reverse by exploiting lower grade, finer disseminated ores.

"Canada is known as a power house of the vast coal and mineral resources. While enjoying a healthy economic growth riding on these natural resources, the mining industry is facing great technical and environmental challenges. With rapid depletion of rich and easy-to-process ores, industry is now forced to exploit increasingly lower grade and more complex ores, which requires more energy and calls for more efficient separation technologies to achieve desired process performance. Ultrafine particles of excessively high surface area to mass ratio exhibit special characteristics, which can cause severe problems in processing of low grade and complex ores. 



In this project, a systematic approach will be used to understand characteristics of ultrafine particles in coal and mineral processing. Using zeta potential distribution measurement, interactions of ultrafine particles relevant to mineral and coal processing systems with model silica and alumina particles will be investigated. The deposition kinetics of ultrafine particles on well defined crystals will be determined using in situ attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR. The colloidal forces will be determined directly using atomic force microscope with blunted AFM tips under well controlled environment to understand molecular mechanism of interaction forces and to probe anisotropic surface properties of talc and clays. The experimental results will be analyzed using the classical DLVO theory to elucidate the applicability of the theory to ultrafine particle systems. The fundamental knowledge derived from this project will provide a foundation to develop cutting edge technologies for processing of lower grade, more complex ores to meet future needs of the industry. The methodology and knowledge derived through this study could be highly applicable to research in nanoscience and nanotechnology of much wider implications.

"The equipment requested in this proposal will enable researchers in the Biology Department at Carleton University to conduct histological studies on a wide range of animal and plant tissues. The motorized rotary microtome requested is highly versatile in that it is designed to section soft tissues (e.g. nervous system, leaves) that are typically embedded in paraffin wax, as well as hard tissues (e.g. insect cuticle, seeds) that must be embedded in epoxy-resin (plastic). Resin-embedded materials also display better cellular details and enable researchers to reconstruct complex tissues such as insect sensory organs and plant embryos in 3 dimensions. A motorized rotary microtome is urgently needed to accommodate researchers that need to section resin-embedded specimens, and to accommodate the high volume of paraffin histology now being carried out on a single departmental microtome capable of sectioning only paraffin blocks. Dr. Yack's group will use this equipment on a daily basis to describe and elucidate the functional organization of novel acoustic sensory organs and sound producing structures in invertebrates (e.g. destructive bark beetles, earthworms, butterflies). This research will contribute to our knowledge of animal communication systems and sensory systems, and have application to insect biocontrol and miniature sensing devices. Drs. Rowland and Hepworth will use this microtome to study plant protective barriers and plant development respectively. Their research programs contribute to the molecular breeding programs of crop and retail plants for enhanced yield, hardiness, and ornamental novelty. The requested equipment will directly support the research programs of Drs. Yack, Rowland and Hepworth, and will supplement research programs of other faculty members (Drs. Bertram, Forbes, Smith and others) who require usage of a histology facility on an occasional basis. The acquisition of this new equipment will support the research and training of an estimated 20 students each year.

"My research program investigates how animals use their sensory systems to detect and process information from their natural environments. A current focus is on insect hearing and vibration communication.  Insects have an amazing diversity of unique sensory organs that can detect and process acoustic signals extending far beyond human sensory capabilities. We will identify and characterize novel acoustic communication systems in butterflies, caterpillars and beetles.  My research group uses neurophysiology, laser vibrometry, neuroanatomy, high speed videography, and behavioural experiments to explain how insects interact acoustically with their environment.  My laboratory has discovered that many butterflies possess sensitive ears on their wings used for communication and predator detection.  We now aim to describe which butterflies have ears, how these ears function physiologically, and what evolutionary processes led to 'new' or 'degenerate' auditory systems. This research will teach us about the sensory ecology of butterflies, many of which are endemic to fragile ecosystems in Canada and worldwide.  A second goal is to uncover how caterpillars communicate acoustically.  For example, we will study how some species rely on vibrations to space themselves on their host plants, and will identify the sensory organs they use for detecting minute vibrations.  We will also study how some larvae, including pest species like the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea) and tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), use airborne sounds to avoid predators.  A third goal is to identify novel acoustic receptors in different invertebrates, such as bark beetles (Scolytidae), a group that imposes a major threat to the Canadian timber industry.  Our research could be implemented in the design of pest control devices that trap insects or interfere with sensory mechanisms involved in feeding or maintaining groups.  Understanding the functional organization of acoustic receptors in insects could also lead to innovative developments for miniature sensing devices.  Finally, the proposed research will provide background training for students seeking careers in research, the health sciences, teaching, and entomology.

"The objective of the proposed research is to introduce and test new techniques for monitoring, diagnosis and prognosis of machine health based on condition monitoring, to compare the performance of those techniques, and to optimize maintenance actions accordingly. The first technique is a combination of the Proportional Hazards Model (PHM) and a Partially Observable Markov Decision Model (POMDM), two models which are frequently mentioned in the literature, but which are used separately. The second technique is based on a Statistical Process Control (SPC) chart, the Hotelling's  T2 . The third technique uses the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model, which was originally developed for solving pattern recognition problems. The fourth technique applies the Logical Analysis of Data (LAD), a combinatorics and optimization-based data analysis method.These techniques represent four different approaches to CBM based on modeling degradation, outlier detection, regression analysis, and group classification, respectively.

The scientific approach is to model and then compare the performance of those four techniques based on the following key elements of CBM:1.The detection of trends or patterns in the monitored indicators; 

2.The prediction of the machine's future health based on the remaining useful life or the probability of failure;

3. The interface of an optimization tool or a maintenance decision-making process with those techniques.

The novelty of this work is twofold:

1.Three of the four approaches have never been used for prediction or with an optimization tool in condition based maintenance, although success in applying these techniques for diagnosis has been reported. It is expected that those techniques will perform well in CBM and thus new techniques will be available to interested practitionners.

2.A comparative study of different techniques used in CBM has never been reported. It is expected that such a study will help practitionner identify the most suitable techniques for their needs.

"Protein/Peptide Purification Platform - This application requests funding for the purchase and installation of a state-of-the-art protein/peptide purification platform critical to the NSERC Discovery funded research programs of several research groups who share a common interest in the structure-function relationships (SFRs) of proteins and peptides. These programs include the SFRs of:  food and disease related aspartic proteases (Yada); proteins/peptides related to muscle growth and post mortem muscle quality (Purslow); dairy-related proteins/systems (Corredig); and antimicrobial/anti-food pathogen peptides (Mine).  In order to conduct fundamental mechanistic studies it is critical that biomolecules (proteins/peptides) be isolated from complex systems.  Funding for the ""AKTApurifier"" is requested for the following: the system is considered to be ideal for the intended purposes due to its superior resolution and user interface combined with its compatibility with low pressure purification columns, and this system is familiar to the applicants thereby avoiding training on a new system.   Over the past four years, the purification capacity in the department has become taxed to the limit resulting in project delays for our group as well as our collaborators.  At present, the 4 groups are involved in numerous projects that would require the use of the present AKTA FPLC purchased in 2003.  Typically, this instrument is used 14-16 hours per day. Finally, related to the issue of usage, repairs on the present system are becoming increasingly more frequent (valve and pump malfunctions) resulting in down time and associated incurred costs.  Finally, in addition to the arguments made above, the acquisition of a state of the art protein/peptide purification platform would enhance the recruitment and retention of HQP from other disciplines such as biochemistry, molecular biology, physics, to the multidisciplinary field of food science research thereby diversifying our collective groups' strengths.

"The long-term goal of our NSERC funded research program has been to elucidate and refine the nature of structure-function relationships (SFRs) of food-related proteins (particularly enzymes) at a fundamental, molecular level. In the food area, aspartic proteinases (APs) play a prominent role as processing aids in the manufacture of a variety of products, e.g., chymosin is used to coagulate milk in the production of cheese. APs are characterized by various properties, e.g., two catalytic aspartate residues localized in two short amino acid stretches sharing sequence homology, optimal catalytic activity at acidic pH values, a scission preference between large, hydrophobic amino acids, and inhibition by pepstatin. While most APs conform to these characteristics, there are differences (e.g., pH stability, substrate specificity, glycosylation) that make APs an excellent model for SFR studies. The proposed research is a continuation of our fundamental, mechanistic examination of the SFRs of APs using a combination of protein engineering and physicochemical techniques and has 3 objectives: 1) to assess the universality of SFRs of aspartic proteinases by examining SFRs of parasitic (Plasmodium falciparum) and plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) APs; 2) to better understand protein folding/refolding as related to structural/functional stability by elucidating factors (e.g., influence of prosegment) that impact on these phenomena using techniques such as neutron scattering and calorimetry;  and finally 3) to further explore the use of rational redesign strategy (i.e., the introduction of key structural elements that are not available through techniques such as site directed mutagenesis) in the development of novel, engineered functionalities (e.g., inclusion of a bioactive peptide sequence in an AP prosegment and its effect on the  activity and the SFRs of the peptide and AP). The data generated from the proposed studies will undoubtedly aid in the further refinement of a mechanistic understanding of the SFRs of APs, and pragmatically, in the efficient use and design of proteins with desired and/or novel function(s).","Structure function relationships of food-related proteins/enzymes","Processed food products and beverages",CANADA,CANADA,"Food chemistry and analysis"

"The objective of the proposed research is to investigate, design and implement new advanced CMOS image sensors for biomedical and security applications, consisting of highly parallel, mixed analog, and digital very large scale of integration (VLSI) circuitry. In the past, solid state imagers were based on charged coupled devices (CCD). Recently, however, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based active pixel sensors (APS) with outstanding advantages in integration, power, reliability and cost have been developed and implemented in leading edge microelectronics and VLSI circuitry. This has led to the development of a whole new generation of cameras capable of being used inside the body for many hours, such as the pill camera taking images within the gastro-intestinal tract.

This proposal will advance the development of ""smart"" CMOS imagers that support high performance, compact, low-cost sensors with real time output. The focus of the research will be on developing core sensors and on-chip peripherals including digital and analog blocks that can incorporate multiple functions in real time while minimizing their on-chip area. Particular emphasis will be placed on developing a High and Low Light Level Imager (HaLLLI) based on our work in CMOS APS with wide dynamic range and our work on Low Light Level Imaging. This work is of particular importance to biomedical applications where there might be much more than 10 bits in brightness ratio between the darkest and brightest parts of the image (which CCD or CMOS sensors usually can accommodate). Further research and development emphasis will be placed on the creation of an imager with an inherent watermark for enhanced security. One anticipated result of this work is a semi-robust watermarking algorithm suitable for VLSI implementation in a system-on-a-chip. This work is instrumental in the development of integrated imagers and sensors that can be used in applications where, for example, data authenticity is crucial, or where distributed image sensor systems are prone to attack.

"Wireless equipment is now part of our daily life: cellular phones and pagers, cordless computer peripherals, security systems, positioning systems for cars and airplanes, remote devices, and many others. In fact, no one can imagine life without wireless broadband communication systems. Even if cost, size, shape, packaging, and weight are of major importance, accessibility to additional services such as text messaging, email, Internet, photo and video camera, etc., is crucial for a potential purchaser. Integrating so many and different aspects in a single device leads to multi-task design with simultaneous consideration of technical and reliability criteria. 

As such, there is a challenge for further research towards development of efficient component models and circuit design Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools for broadband communication system technology in both the centimetre and millimetre frequency ranges. In fact, the rapid growth of today's Microwave Integrated Circuits (MICs) requires a permanent upgrading of existing CAD tools. At the component level, such modelling tools should successfully integrate high-order nonlinear, electromagnetic (EM), as well as thermal effects. On the other hand, reliable CAD of radiofrequency and microwave integrated circuits requires advanced modelling/design tools that could efficiently predict the overall system response. 

The research axes proposed in this proposal are aligned with microelectronics, wireless systems, component and circuit modeling, computational EM, and system design, fabrication and testing. Such research areas are relevant to industry needs and have the real potential to provide RF/microwave designers and scientists with flexible and reliable CAD tools.

"Drug solubility continues to be an ultimate pursuit of pharmacological scientists, and represents a highly desirable aim for health care cost reduction. Drug formulations are intimately connected to the pathway of their administration. Some drugs have never been marketed, due to their chemical instabilities, toxicities and the ubiquities of their metabolic pathways, their pharmacological benefits remaining unexploited, prior to major surgeries, such as nitric oxide (NO), are cases in point. Many strategies have been suggested to counteract the poor solubility problem, such as the use of polymeric scaffolds containing the drugs, but due to their unknown degradation kinetics, any attempts at tailoring drug dosimetry are hindered. Two further challenges will have to be overcome for the drug to truly fulfill its therapeutic effects: targeting and controlled release. The targeting of specific cell populations reduces systemic side effects; hence extending new medical applications to a myriad of patient categories, whose treatments, using particularly toxic chemicals, have so far been impossible. Such an example is the administration of anesthetics to elderly patients, neonates and infants. Controlled release would assure the continual presence of the drug for periods necessary for demonstrable therapeutic effects. In this project, we seek to demonstrate the feasibility of the pulmonary administration of therapeutic gaseous drugs bound to superparamagnetic nanoparticles that can be magnetically targeted; the drug must be delivered at an appropriate rate, for an appropriate period of time, and the nanoparticles must not present health risks. We do this by chemically binding the gas NO to functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles (FDA approved) that will then be loaded into submicron-sized polymer particles large enough to pass through the airway, into the deep lungs, to release the NO. Magnetic fields serve to target the particles to the lung walls, to maintain their presence there for long therapeutic periods. This will be the feasibility study of a two parts research programme,  having to do with nanoparticle functionalization and the formation of submicron-sized chitosan particles. The second part will concern delivery into animal models and monitoring.","NSERC/MRI, guided delivery and controlled release of core/shell superparamagnetic nanoparticle-based submicron-sized respiratory and systemic drug carriers","Biomedical engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical engineering"
"Nanotechnology is likely to evolve rapidly into further complexity where nanorobots that consist of many different nanomaterials will be made. Recently, nanomaterials have received an enormous amount of attention to create new types of tools for life sciences. In our Laboratory, we selected two smart nanomaterials which can be non-invasively driven by an external power source such Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Both nanomaterials have many interesting properties that will eventually lead to a variety of applications as nanodelivery system, nanomuscles and actuators for nanorobots. The main objectives of the proposed project are: identify the key physicochemical properties of CNTs at the molecular level that govern protein adsorption patterns and develop a fabrication protocol that leads to a favourable biological response. Validate the use of carbon nanotubes for medical applications via the optimization of their biocompatibility by surface functionalization and improvements in the formulation protocol.

"This proposal is part of the applicant's ongoing efforts to explore the potential uses and benefits of dissolved gas and ultrasound technologies, and to encourage and promote their implementation in the mineral processing industry.



Dissolved gas and ultrasound have important roles to play in mineral processing, but much research and development work are needed before industry becomes convinced of their benefits and considers implementing them in industrial practice. ""Dissolved gas"" can be used as a source for generating gas bubbles for mineral flotation processes. It is known that bubbles derived from dissolved gas are much finer than mechanically produced conventional bubbles and are better suited to the flotation of fine and ultra-fine minerals. Dissolved gas bubbles are obtained by first dissolving a gas (usually air) in the flotation pulp under pressure and then releasing the pressure. Depressurization causes the dissolved gas to come out of solution in the form of fine bubbles, but what is perhaps more interesting is that bubbles nucleate on mineral surfaces as they form and this further enhances the recovery of fine particles by eliminating the need for bubble-particle collision that would otherwise be necessary for bubble attachment to occur. 



With respect to the use of ultrasound, two areas of application will be considered: (a) mineral flotation, and (b) gold extraction by cyanidation. The benefits of ultrasound in these applications are derived from the unique phenomenon known as ""acoustic cavitation"" which occurs when ultrasonic waves are passed through a liquid. The main effect of this process in flotation is the cleaning of mineral particles to enhance or modify their surface properties. In the cyanidation process for gold extraction, ultrasound can significantly increase the gold dissolution rate which is otherwise a very slow process.","Dissolved gas and ultrasound applications in mineral processing","Mineral resources ( prospecting, exploration, mining, extraction, processing)",CANADA,CANADA,"Mineral processing"

"RNA interference (RNAi) is a recently discovered phenomenon. Small interference RNAs (siRNAs) were found to have the ability to induce degradation of specific messenger RNAs, and hence silence expression of specific genes. Therefore, they are being pursued by pharmaceutical companies as potential therapeutic agents for a wide range of diseases. These development efforts are faced with two major hurdles: the poor stability of siRNAs in serum and the poor efficiency for siRNAs to cross cell membranes. It is proposed here that by linking an appropriately designed carbohydrate molecule to an siRNA molecule, the stability of the siRNA molecule will be improved. More importantly, this modification will provide a handle to enhance the efficiency in transporting siRNA molecules across cell membranes. These combined benefits will facilitate the development of novel RNAi therapeutics to bring relief to patients suffering from certain diseases.

"Learning and experience continuously shape the brain (referred to as plasticity).  This is a learning process that is an essential brain function for our everyday life. It is believed that auditory learning or experience induces significant changes of neuronal function in the central auditory system.  This change is called auditory plasticity that is guided by acquired sounds (sound-guided auditory plasticity).  This suggests that the brain can adapt to changes in acoustic environment:  but how?  The proposed study will examine how the built-in neural wiring in the brain underlies the sound-guided auditory plasticity.  We specifically focus on the reciprocal projections between the cortex and subcortical nuclei and the cholinergic projections to the auditory system.  Auditory plasticity will be assessed by the changes in the receptive fields of auditory neurons with an electrophysiological approach.  We expect that the reciprocal projections (between the auditory cortex and subcortical nuclei) combined with its cholinergic inputs constitutes an integrative functional unit responsible for inducing and coordinating sound-guided auditory plasticity.  Results from the proposed study, together with our previous findings, will elucidate a comprehensive neural circuit responsible for sound-guided auditory plasticity.  This established circuitry will significantly improve our understanding of the neural basis of learning.","Neural circuitry for sound-guided auditory plasticity: tonotopic cortico-subcortical loop combined with cholinergic inputs","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Sensory systems -- auditory"

"Because of decades of acid deposition, and multiple cycles of logging and forest re-growth, calcium (Ca) concentrations are currently falling in soils and lakes in Eastern Canada.  In consequence, populations of Ca-rich biota, such as the planktonic water flea, Daphnia, are declining.  Because Daphnia are important contributors to pelagic biodiversity, and conduits of food and energy to fish, their losses are of concern to aquatic ecologists and informed lake managers.  The response of Daphniids to Ca decline varies with their nutritional status, and likely with exposure to other stressors, such as metals.  Thus to quantify the damaging Ca thresholds, we must pay attention in our experiments to other stressors such as nutrients and metals. To identify the mechanisms of effect, we also need controlled laboratory bioassays, followed by research at both the biochemical and molecular (i.e. gene expression) levels.   York University's Field Laboratory for the Assessment of Multiple Ecological Stressors (FLAMES lab) is well equipped to conduct the needed multiple-stressor bioassays on daphniids, but does not have the needed equipment to control bacterial levels in bioassay media, nor to maintain samples in a stable condition for subsequent molecular assays.  I request an autoclave and a cryogenic freezer to fill these needs.  This equipment will permit much improved control of bacterial levels in assay media, and will foster research on the mechanisms underlying low Ca stress on daphniids in an increasing complex world, i.e. with warming waters, lower phosphorus and metals.   This equipment will foster the interdisciplinary training of 4 young scientists in the newly recognized, widespread threat of environmental calcium decline.    Canada is uniquely blessed with freshwater lakes, but their protection and management requires new tools to deal with newly recognized complexities.  The equipment in this application will foster the practical development of toxicogenomics, a field poised to produce a whole new box of assessment tools, tools needed to select from among multiple plausible causes of environmental damage, those actual causes of disturbance that warrant management intervention.","Purchasing an autoclave and a cryogenic freezer to foster research on the effects of environmental change on plankton","Inland waters",CANADA,CANADA,"Aquatic ecology and limnology"

"The objective of this project is to study the techniques for building self-manageable Web service processes. Web services are software components which communicate and interact with each other using standard Internet protocols. Software components developed in different programming languages and deployed on different platforms can easily be invoked if they are wrapped as Web services. This is because Internet protocols, such as HTTP and the information format XML used by Web services, are commonly used by many programming languages and on many platforms. Web services are not for human beings to browse, but for software to operate automatically. Web services are a new generation of middleware that have been successfully used for system integrations problems, e.g. connecting heterogeneous data sources. There is a demand to build fully automatic business processes by connecting distributed Web services. Current techniques allow us to build automatic Web service processes in a predefined manner. A Web service process can be defined in a Web service process description language such as BPEL. In such a process, all the Web services are fixed; how they interact with each other is determined at during their design. This process cannot change at run time. If any faults occur, the process simply halts. It would be ideal if the business process could automatically select the best Web services to achieve its goals and, if a Web service were to break down, the business process could switch to other similar Web services and compensate the failure effects. A self-manageable Web service process is a fully automated Web service process with mechanisms for adapting to changes, such as run time execution monitoring, sophisticated way of fault diagnosis and recovery, run time partners selection and changing. As Web services are widely used in e-business applications, scientific computing and software systems, this project will bring great impact.

"Few-body atomic and molecular systems, such as H, He, Li, H2+ , are fundamental testing grounds for basic physics. Due to recent development of techniques, such as femtosecond optical comb, measurements on few body systems can now reach an unprecedented high precision, providing many exciting opportunities for theorists to explore fundamental physics by performing calculations on small but extremely important effects, such as high order relativistic and quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects. Through comparison between theory and experiment, one can test the existing theory and discover possible new physics, such as violation of fundamental symmetries; one can also extract precise values of fundamental constants, such as the fine structure constant and the electron-proton mass ratio, and study their variation in time. In the past 10 years, we have made significant advances in obtaining high precision solutions to the Schrodinger equation for three and four body atomic and molecular systems, which allows us to calculate relativistic and QED effects  precisely. One of the important applications of our work is the precise determination of the nuclear charge radius of halo lithium, 11Li, in collaboration with two leading experimental groups at TRIUMF and GSI. To determine the charge radius, it is necessary to calculate the mass-dependent part of the isotope shift with high precision, including relativistic and QED corrections. While this was possible for one and two-electron systems since the 1980's, for Li and Li-like ions, the breakthrough came in 2000 when we succeeded in calculating the mass effect in transitions of neutral Li with an uncertainty of better than 5 parts per million. The significance of our method is that no other method is both independent of nuclear structure models and capable of yielding sufficient accuracy for the nuclear charge radius. Comparisons with our results are therefore capable of distinguishing amongst the various possible candidates for the nuclear forces. Our high precision theory that is now available creates new opportunities to develop measurement tools that would otherwise not exist, and opens up a new area of study at the interface between atomic physics and nuclear physics.

"The Department of Civil Engineering at the University of British Columbia has a 450 sq m high head-room structural testing laboratory containing a 9 m x 22 m reaction floor which can be used with various moveable reaction frames and hydraulic loading systems for large-scale substructure testing. The laboratory is equipped with a state-of-the-art MTS FlexTest GT Controller for structural testing with optional real-time hybrid control capabilities. In addition, the laboratory has a 4.9 m high L-shaped reaction wall (9.3 m x 4.3 m) and a 96-channel National Instruments SCXI data acquisition system. The presence of the reaction wall, state-of-the-art controller and data acquisition system make the laboratory ideal for high-performance testing of structural components subjected to large earthquake demands. Unfortunately the laboratory is hampered by lacking of high-quality high-capacity actuators for substructure experimental testing. The laboratory has one new 1000 kN actuator with dynamic capabilities which was purchased using past CFI grant. With the exception of this actuator, the operational actuators available in the laboratory are 18 to 35 years old. Many of these actuators do not have servo-values, displacement transducers or load cells which is necessary to be used in modern experimental testing. This proposal seeks to complement the currently available equipment with two additional high-quality high-capacity (1000 kN) hydraulic actuators. With the requested hydraulic actuators versatile experimental testing of different structural configurations will become possible. This will significantly strengthen British Columbia and Canada's ability to conduct state-of-the-art experimental testing to evaluate the hazard from earthquakes.","High performance structural testing laboratory","Structural engineering",CANADA,CANADA,"Structural engineering"

"There are many situations where a group of mobile agents, such as police officers, soldiers, or even robots, must search a prescribed area for one or more mobile fugitives. For example, consider a search party looking for a missing person in the wilderness.  Coordinating this group of searchers is an intimidating task, and guaranteeing that the search party does not overlook an area seems overwhelming.  Technology such as GPS can help searchers improve coordination, but the search party still relies on search strategies that are developed by humans. Our proposed research focuses on automating the computation of search strategies in such scenarios.  We model the area that needs to be searched by a so-called terrain, a mathematical model that easily captures information about different elevations.  We are concerned with finding algorithms for computing search strategies of terrains that are guaranteed to find the  missing person.  Many interesting questions arise with relation to this problem.  For  example, given a terrain, what is the minimum number of searchers required to search the  terrain? and what is the minimum cost to search the terrain?  These questions are particularly important for applications where the number of searchers is limited.



We are very interested in investigating mathematical models of search strategies that are commonly  used by humans.  For example, consider our motivating example where a search party is looking for a missing person. In order to ensure that no area is overlooked, the search party will often employ a chain-search strategy: the searchers form a chain that sweeps over the search area.  Reseachers have considered algorithms for computing chain-search strategies for mathematical models of building floorplans, but these algorithms cannot be used in scenarios where the search area contains hills and valleys. Our research will provide new algorithms and eventually software that will assist in various search-and-rescue applications.

"Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) plays an increasingly important role in the petroleum industry since there are fewer newly discovered oil reserves. After primary recovery and secondary recovery, the oil remaining in the light and medium oil reservoirs is generally in the range of 50~60% of the original oil in place. Among the EOR methods for the light and medium oil reservoirs, miscible displacement by injecting high-pressure gases has been successful to a large extent under favorable conditions. In particular, CO2 injection is considered as the most promising EOR technique in the near future because it not only greatly enhances oil recovery but also considerably reduces greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 EOR has been used as a commercial process for enhancing oil recovery since the 1970's, whereas limited field applications of CO2 storage have been undertaken only recently. Successful CO2 EOR and CO2 storage processes result from continuous monitoring and surveillance on the reservoir performance. Although simultaneous integration of monitoring results and reservoir simulation and modeling represent the best chance for success, how to accomplish this task remains a challenging issue for a CO2 EOR and CO2 storage process. In addition, optimization of both CO2 EOR and CO2 storage processes differs significantly from current CO2 injection practices. 

    The objective of this proposed research project is to maximize both oil recovery and CO2 storage in a CO2 injection process by optimizing the displacement efficiency under uncertainty. This research project will not only provide direct technical support for implementing CO2 EOR and storage in the oil and gas industry, but also generate new knowledge that will be useful for other EOR processes. Furthermore, the theoretical models developed in this study can be used to couple with various reservoir simulators for achieving general applicability for optimizing displacement efficiency under uncertainty. Therefore, such research achievements can be readily used to guide the practical field design and operations of CO2 EOR and storage processes.

"While the wireless communication industry has witnessed an unpreceded era of exciting developments over the last three decades, the ultimate goal of delivering ubiquitous multimedia services with the same high quality as wire-line systems still requires significant more research efforts. A major design objective of beyond fourth-generation (B4G) wireless systems is the delivery of extremely high data rate services, in the order of multiple gigabits per second, to every eligible users in the system. The proposed research program will develop important cutting-edge enabling techniques for ubiquitous gigabit wireless access. We will devise effective transmission schemes by optimally integrating advanced point-to-point transmission techniques, such as adaptive transmission and reception technique, multiple antenna transmission and reception (MIMO) technique and cross-layer scheduling technique, with cooperative/multihop relaying techniques. Specifically, the following three broad research directions will be actively pursued. First, as multiuser MIMO transmission can effectively explore the spatial degree of freedom for capacity gain, we address the design and analysis of efficient scheduling and signaling schemes for multiuser MIMO systems to maximally benefit from collaborative relay transmission. Secondly, the time varying nature of the wireless propagation channels and user traffic patterns entail an adaptive implementation for high system efficiency. As such, we will develop innovative adaptive signaling schemes for relay/multihop transmission links. Finally, the efficient utilization of the limited resource of wireless systems mandates the operations of different layers in the protocol stack be properly coordinated. We will also investigate the optimal joint design of various adaptive mechanisms in different layers to cost-effectively provide the desired high quality transmission service over multihop wireless links. The resulting multihop multi-antenna adaptive transmission involving multiple layers will provide an attractive novel solution for extremely high rate wireless transmission.

"Fluids are strategically associated with both the formation and preservation of most types of economic ore deposit, especially those in sedimentary basins. Numerical modeling has proven to be an efficient tool for testing, comparing and contrasting various hypotheses regarding subsurface fluid flow and the resulting ore-forming processes. The proposed research program is aimed at developing and applying 'geologically realistic' numerical models for quantifying ore genesis, in particular in unconformity-type uranium mineralization in sedimentary basins. The research will concentrate on two ancient basins of different ages, the eastern Paleoproterozoic Thelon Basin (Canada) and the Mesozoic Zhongfeng Basin (China). An integrated computational modeling approach will be employed to advance our understanding of unconformity-type ore genesis. The proposed research will support the training of two Ph.D. students, and it will also result in a theoretical framework to quantify the nature, pathways and timespan of hydrothermal fluid flow during ore genesis and establish a range of effective exploration criteria to target new major deposits in the selected sedimentary basins and in other similar basins elsewhere in the world.","Integrated numerical investigation of hydrothermal fluid flow in sedimentary basins: implications for the formation of unconformity-type uranium deposits","Earth sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Earth science (see also marine geology 4604)"

"Driven by the rapid growth of the Internet, communication technologies, pervasive computing, automobiles, airplanes, wireless and portable consumer electronics, embedded systems  have moved from a craft to an emerging and very promising discipline in today's electronic industry. 

Testing of a fabricated chip is a process that applies a sequence of inputs to the chip and analyzes the chip's output sequence to ascertain whether it functions correctly. As the chip density grows to beyond millions of gates, embedded system testing becomes a formidable task. Vast amounts of time and money have been invested by the semiconductor industry just to ensure the high testability of products. On the other hand, as design complexity drastically increases, current gate-level design and test methodology alone can no longer satisfy stringent time-to-market requirements. The proposed High-Level Test Synthesis (HLTS) system will develop new systematic built-in, self-testable techniques to integrate testability consideration into the synthesis process, and make it possible for an automatic synthesis tool to predict testability of the synthesized circuits accurately in the early stage. It also optimizes the designs in terms of test cost, as well as performance and hardware area cost.



Additionally, the proposal targets another problematic consideration affecting the design of systems-on-chip and embedded systems, namely the power consumption. All the existing research, including my previous work on high-level synthesis approaches, has considered low power and testability as two separate optimization objectives. I am planning to extend the above built-in, self-testable synthesis system for low-power dissipation. It is anticipated that a data path allocation and integrated synthesis algorithms (with scheduling and allocation) will be developed to achieve a fully self-testable design and low power dissipation without resulting performance degradation and with minimal area overhead.

"In modern society, individuals are generally overloaded with information. To ensure efficiency, we need to constantly focus attention on task-relevant information and inhibit task-irrelevant information. Previous work by the applicant and colleagues suggests an age-related decline in inhibition (i.e., the ability to inhibit irrelevant information). For example, older adults have trouble concentrating on reading amidst background noises. Echoing this finding, older adults are less able to suppress their brain activity associated with distracting information. Despite the clear evidence for an age-related deficit in inhibition and its consequent disruption in memory performance, we know surprisingly little about how to aid older adults to deal with interference. Inspired by the empirical evidence that the ability to process emotional information preserves or even improves with age, and a recent finding that emotional stimuli can reduce interference in younger adults, I take a novel perspective to determine whether older adults' deficits in inhibition could be moderated by the emotional arousal of the stimuli and through emotion-focused cognitive training. The project will be carried out in three phases. In Phase 1, behavioural data will be collected to examine whether the emotional arousal of stimuli moderates inhibition in performing memory tasks for younger and older adults. In Phase 2, neuroimaging data will be collected using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique to examine the interaction between the two neural systems underlying inhibition and emotional processing in younger and older adults. These studies will provide novel insights into the understanding of the effects of emotion on inhibition in the aging brain. Finally, in Phase 3, I intend to develop an emotion-focused training protocol to help older adults deal with interference. In sum, the proposed research represents a novel approach to understand age differences in the ability to inhibit interference amidst emotional information. The findings of this research will make significant contributions to the theories of cognitive and neural aging, and will lead to innovative and effective experimental designs and paradigms in the area of aging research.","The interaction between emotion and inhibition in the aging brain: behavioural and neuroimaging studies",Psychology,CANADA,CANADA,"Cognitive science -- development"

"This research program is designed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which haptenated antigens interfere with the biological aspects of mucosal tolerance. Both tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells play a critical role in the establishment/maintenance of mucosal tolerance; the latter plays a central role in maintaining the homeostasis in the body. Defect of either regulatory T cells or tolerogenic dendritic cells plays a critical role in skewed cellular responses. 

      In this study, we will focus on the biological aspects, the molecular/cellular activities of dendritic cells and T lymphocytes in response to exposure to haptenated antigens. The mechanisms by which haptenated antigens modulate tolerogenic properties of dendritic cells and differentiation of regulatory T cells will be investigated; its consequence on the activities of effector T lymphocytes (the biological aspects) will be examined.

      The outcome of the proposed study is expected to reveal that exposure to haptenated antigens compromises dendritic cells' tolerogenic properties and impairs the differentiation of regulatory T cells; such modifications will interfere with the homeostasis in the body (e.g., the establishment/maintenance of mucosal tolerance). This study has the potential to further understand the mechanism of modulation of the homeostasis in the body and provide the novel information for a broad array of studies in cell biology.

      Meanwhile, we will also train new research personnel in carrying out the study.

"Correct identification of natural hybrids between Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. and P. banksiana Lamb. (PCBC) is essential for assessing their evolutionary significance. Despite numerous morphological, biochemical and molecular studies conducted over decades, hybrids identification from this hybrid zone remains difficult for two main reasons. First, classic Anderson's hybrid index or similar morphometric indices are based on marked phenotypic differences between hybrids and their parental species but the observed character correlation and morphological intermediacy could arise from evolutionary phenomena (e.g., remnants of ancestral population of two isolated species) other than hybridization per se. Second, a lack of unique molecular markers for parental genotypes and the close genetic affinity among PCBC populations have not significantly improved the capability of morphological characters to separate hybrids from the parental species. Recent advances in discovery of vast numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in many species including pines have raised prospects of genomewide association studies. However, due to the large genome sizes (~30 billion bp) and rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium (within 1000 bp or faster) in outcrossing pines, a candidate gene approach is more appropriate for these conifers. In this proposal, I will develop a 'quais-genomewide' hybrid index for drought tolerance from affordable and abundant SNPs towards unambiguous identification of hybrids and parental individuals and populations in PCBC complex. I will use total tree height as a surrogate to measure phenotypic variation among 36 PCBC populations in response to drought. The 'quasi-genomewide' hybrid index for drought tolerance will be then predicted as the sum of genotypic (breeding) values across all SNP markers under different mixed models. The proposed association genetics approach to identification of hybrids uses the latest mixed-model developments that allow for combining the information of adaptive traits with SNP markers and thus is a major step towards resolving a longstanding issue of classification and use of natural hybrids.

"Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a new imaging modality that provides high resolution (near cellular level) suitable for real-time imaging and is becoming available for imaging the retina and other organs for neoplastic and vascular lesions. Doppler OCT (DOCT) adds blood flow imaging capability which is sensitive to slow blood flow in the microcirculation, and has been shown to detect neovasculature in pre-cancer and cancerous conditions.  Recently there has been a growing interest in high power cladding pumped fiber lasers such as Yb doped fiber lasers, as a replacement for conventional lasers.  Frequency domain mode locking of such fiber lasers may provide an optimal light source for DOCT at a wavelength range of 1027-1105 nm, optimal for imaging biological tissues.  We will develop a low-cost and low-maintenance Yb doped fiber laser for multichannel array based DOCT, which could be extremely useful for guiding the next generation laser-based treatments, such as 2-photon photodynamic therapy, and provide a tightly controlled damage radius to preserve normal tissue.

"Hierarchical multi-resolution models are powerful tools for robust and effective computation in computer graphics and image processing, in an adaptive and progressive style. I will focus on the following specific topics:

- To apply the hybrid hierarchical modeling method developed for hair rendering to a dynamic water simulation problem. Examples include a waterfall's dynamic shape as influenced by the features of the cliff face and wind factors, or large waves splashing onto rocks. In this work, our goal is to develop a unified framework for water state transition between liquid, droplets, and mist.

- To extend the mathematical formulation of an emerging region portioning method, achieved through the mean shift algorithm, by introducing a variation factor, and to explore this method in scale-space resulting in a hierarchical representation and two novel applications in the areas of texture analysis and no-reference image metrics. 

- To investigate an adaptive partitioning algorithm for edge detection in images that groups edge points hierarchically according to their natural spatial clustering. An extension of this work will result in a novel sparse matrix representation for the high-dimensional accumulators used by the Hough Transform in handling curves.

My long-term goals are:

- To generalize my hybrid hierarchical modeling method into a framework that can handle a variety of complex natural phenomena for computer graphics.

- To develop a general framework for extracting and organizing object boundaries from complex images as piecewise lines and arc segments for the general purpose of object recognition.

- To develop a content-based, no-reference image and video-quality metric.

"We are moving from conventional cellular mobile communications to a truly pervasive wireless environment with a plethora of wireless devices and networks. Due to relatively low transmit power of the wireless devices and/or due to very high data rates, multihop communications will inevitably become a natural, integral, and essential characteristic of this environment. Multihop communications is a very broad concept, which is still in its infancy, with different manifestations. This research program is on relay based multihop communications in next generation infrastructure-based wireless networks (such as 4G cellular and WiMax). 



We anticipate a dense wireless relay network with a high number of various forms of relays. The immediate question that comes to mind in such a complex environment is how to perform radio resource management (RRM). The RRM algorithms which are direct extensions of those used in the current cellular networks will often operate very conservatively in a dense relay network resulting in very poor efficiency. It is not an exaggeration to say that such a network may turn into a nightmare for the service provider from radio resource allocation, management, and utilization points of view.



With advanced RRM algorithms, it may be possible to achieve very dense channel reuse (many times within a cell) in relay enhanced cells. The main goal of the proposed research program is to develop advanced RRM algorithms which will enable opportunistic relaying, and thus almost ubiquitous high data rate coverage, with no (or minimal) bandwidth penalty, in wireless relay networks.



The proposed research will be algorithmic in nature; communications theory, networking theory, and optimization theory will be used to develop suitable RRM strategies and algorithms.

This project is aimed at the development of a non-deterministic system-level paradigm for logic design of nanostructures. This paradigm will serve for studying reliable computing in the nano domain. It includes modeling of nanocircuit behaviour at the architectural level, with the focus on modeling static and dynamic faults in the logic networks of nanodevices. This will be achieved through combining the graph-based data structure representation such as decision trees and diagrams and the Belief Propagation Network. The uncertainty modeling at nanoscale will be extended by utilizing the information-theoretical measures. The components of CAD tools for modeling computing in the nano domain will be developed.

"The proposed research focuses on the development of methodologies and theory on two important aspects of functional data analysis: 1) functional regression analysis; 2) joint modelling of generalized longitudinal data and survival time. The first project is to develop methodologies for a new class of models, Functional Additive Models, which in certain sense unify and generalize functional regression analysis. In this new framework, the regression of the scalar or functional response on functional predictor is not restricted to linear operator, which allows the data ""speak"" for themselves. Comprehensive investigation will be carried out, including model estimation and selection, theory, inference, applications and potential extensions. The second emphasis of this proposal is to jointly model the generalized type of longitudinal data and survival time. This is motivated by the fact that in many clinical trials longitudinal observations are not necessarily continuous, but may be categorical, such as binomial or Poisson outcomes, while most existing approaches deal with continuous longitudinal data. I will present a new perspective from functional data viewpoint, where functional principal component techniques will be exploited to achieve dimension reduction. Automatic algorithms and inference procedures will be developed, which take Monte Carlo error and optimal stopping rules into account. This proposal is motivated by my ongoing and future research collaborations with biologists and physicians. The new approaches will be applied to the datasets generated from these collaborations and will provide useful guidance for future experiments. The procedures developed will be applicable for general functional data from various disciplines, which in turn facilitate the advancement of many scientific fields.

"Research in radio technology reveals that the radio frequency spectrum could be shared among many users more effectively than by allocating fixed narrowband channels. Recently, regulations have appeared to assign blocks of non-channelized spectrum to mobile service providers. One example is the Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology. UWB communications have received significant interest from the research and industry communities. The reason for the increasing interest is because of its potential to offer high data rates, low-power transmission, robustness for multipath fading, and low power dissipation. A major challenge in implementing UWB systems for practical application is the difficulty in efficient signal distribution and processing, which includes the requirement of low-cost distribution of UWB signals over an access network, and the requirement of low-cost signal processing functions such as filtering and frequency conversion. The distribution of UWB over optical fiber, the convergence of the microwave and photonic techniques, has great potential to tackle this challenge. The proposed equipment would support our research in this new research area.

"This five-year research program is concerned with the investigation and development of UltraWideband-over-fiber (UWB-over-fiber) technologies for wireless multiple access communications and sensor networks. The proposed theoretical and experimental research will allow us to lead Canadian and international efforts in searching for innovative UWB-over-fiber technologies for broadband wireless access and sensor networks. UWB, approved by the US Federal Communications Commission in 2002 for unlicensed use from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz, has attracted great interest for short-range high-throughput wireless communications and sensor networks. Such short-range wireless networks can operate mainly in an indoor environment in a stand-alone mode, with nearly nonexistent integration into the fixed wired networks or wireless wide-area infrastructure. To offer availability of undisrupted service across different networks and eventually achieve high-data rate access at any time and from any place, a solution is to combine the UWB with state-of-the-art fiber distribution technology, a new area called UWB over Fiber. In this proposed research program, we will investigate and develop UWB-over-fiber technologies based on optically generated UWB signals that are encoded based on direct sequence code division multiple access and the associated optoelectronic components for multiple user broadband wireless communications and sensor networks.

UWB, approved by the US Federal Communications Commission in 2002 for unlicensed use from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz, has attracted great interest for short-range high-throughput wireless communications and sensor networks. Such short-range wireless networks can operate mainly in an indoor environment in a stand-alone mode, with nearly nonexistent integration into the fixed wired networks or wireless wide-area infrastructure. To offer availability of undisrupted service across different networks and eventually achieve high-data rate access at any time and from any place, a solution is to combine the UWB with state-of-the-art fiber distribution technology, a new area called UWB over Fiber. In this proposed research program, we will investigate and develop UWB-over-fiber technologies based on optically generated UWB signals that are encoded based on direct sequence code division multiple access and the associated optoelectronic components for multiple user broadband wireless communications and sensor networks.

"Machine learning is an important research area in computer science. The key activity of machine learning is to extract rules from data sets that can be used to predict results for unseen data accurately. In other words, we try to develop algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn from data. In this proposal, I will study the theoretical aspects as well as the techniques of granular computing, Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and apply them to critical decision making problems, such as intrusion detection, marketing analysis, financial prediction, and cancer diagnosis.

     As an emerging technique, granular computing has attracted many researchers. The goal of this research is to enhance the learning ability of conventional algorithms as well as to provide more general and flexible granulation algorithms for classification problems and decision making applications. 

     In SOFM, data are clustered based on a set of neurons with the ability to distinguish themselves in terms of differences between input vectors. The competitive process of determining which neuron best fits a particular input vector is challenging when there are many similarity measures are taken into consideration. Game theory and other techniques will be explored to enhance the competitive process in SOFM and thus give it the ability to better organize and analyze more data characteristics.

     SVM has demonstrated excellent performance in real-world applications such as categorization, recognition, and classification. We have adapted rough set theory to SVM for feature selection problems and successfully applied it to an intrusion detection problem. I will continue to explore possible improvements in SVM models for this problem.

     Our ultimate goal is to develop a decision support system that will help users determine which learning method is most suitable for different applications.

"What is the mechanism of a creative design process? How does a manufacturing company explore design innovation in order to survive and succeed in a global market? A product development involves many human roles, such as designers, manufacturers, managers, users, customers, deliverers, etc. How does various human behavior and performance influence design innovation? To address these questions, this proposed research will study how different human roles' behavior and performance affect product design innovation in the design process. The long-term goal of this research program is to develop effective approaches and tools to integrate human factors into every phase of the product development in order to improve product quality and efficiency. 



Designers play a critical role in developing innovative product design. When designers deliver a product, the product will be used by workers or operators in a factory or a workplace. Understanding these users' behavior and performance in workplaces would help designers integrate users' capabilities and limitations into the early design stages to save time and efforts in the design process. Therefore, in the next five years, this research program will focus on evaluating workers' capabilities and limitations in a workplace, developing models of simulating human behavior and performance in various work environments and integrating user characteristics with the design process to assist designers to deliver innovative design solutions.

  

It is anticipated from this research program that an integrated system to simulate workers' capabilities and limitations in a workplace will be developed. Using this system, we can also simulate other human constraints at different work environments and levels. This research will push forward the innovation of product design for manufacturing companies in Canada. The research results will be applied to the Canadian manufacturing industry to help them improve product quality and productive efficiency.","Integration of human factors into engineering design",Engineering,CANADA,CANADA,"Engineering design"
"Information and knowledge granulation plays a central role in human-centered information processing and problem solving.  Any information system of true intelligence must be able to process information and reason at multiple levels of granularity. Granular computing is an emerging field devoted to the study of this topic.  A great challenge faced by researchers is the lack of a well-accepted common understanding and a unified framework.  In the proposed program, I not only search for a unified view of granular computing, but also apply its principles to implement intelligent information systems.  The research program has three parts: building a conceptual framework, constructing a unified model, and implementing prototype information systems based on the framework and the model.   A conceptual framework of granular computing will be fully developed at three levels by drawing results from many branches of science.  Granular computing can be viewed as structured thinking at the philosophical level, structured problem solving at the practical level, and structured information processing at the computational level.  These views correspond naturally to the conceptual understanding, logical design and software implementation of information systems.  A unified model of granular computing will be built by synthesizing scattered results from existing studies and related theories.  The value of the framework and the model will be evaluated by implementing prototype systems, such as information retrieval support systems, research support systems, and intelligent data analysis systems.  

One powerful insight that has emerged from granular computing is the understanding of information processing in the abstract, in the brain, and in the machine. Abstract models of information processing make it possible to explain how the brain works; the understanding of the brain and its information-processing mechanism will provide new insights into how to implement intelligence and information processing in machines. The results will narrow the gap between information processing in the brain and in the machine, leading eventually to commercialization of new types of information systems.","Granular computing for the design and implementation of intelligent information systems","Information systems and technology",CANADA,CANADA,"Information systems design"

"With remaining reserves in the order of 28 billion cubic meters, mineable oil sands and in-situ heavy oil are critical for Canada's future energy needs. Current oil sands extraction and most heavy oil production processes use hot water and steam, respectively. These processes are energy intensive and the available water supply is not sufficient to sustain the current pace of development. Hence, there is a need for alternatives such as solvent-based processes. Data and models of the phase behavior and physical properties of heavy oil and solvent mixtures are required to develop, select, and optimize these processes. 



The objectives of the proposed research program are: 1) to provide data and a modeling methodology for the phase behavior and properties of mixtures of heavy oil or bitumen with hydrocarbon solvents; 2) to design and evaluate solvent-based oil recovery processes. Phase behavior and property data is to be collected using existing infrastructure. Phase behavior models previously developed for mixtures of bitumens and higher carbon number n-alkanes are to be adapted for the solvents of interest including propane, butane, and carbon dioxide. 



One potential method for extracting bitumen from oil sands is to use supercritical solvents. An apparatus to test the proposed approach is to be constructed and tested. Performance will be assessed in terms of solvent requirements, bitumen recovery, solvent losses, and product quality. Parameters to be considered are the choice of solvent, operating temperature and pressure, number of stages, and oil sands quality.

"The airfoil section is a key feature of various lifting surfaces including wings, blades, and hydrofoils, which are vital components in a wide range of engineering systems. Satisfying the needs of the aviation industry, most of the previous investigations of airfoil performance were concerned with airfoils operating at chord Reynolds numbers well above 1,000,000. However, more recent developments in other applications, such as wind turbines, small-scale gas turbines, and unmanned aerial vehicles, brought about an increased interest in airfoil operation at much lower Reynolds numbers (less than 500,000). The proposed work is motivated by the need for additional insight into some key unsteady physical phenomena that govern flow development over an airfoil operating at low Reynolds numbers. The objective of the proposed research is to carry out a detailed analysis of turbulence-related phenomena important in airfoil operation and to develop a novel local flow control method capable of improving airfoil performance. In order to meet this objective, an experimental investigation will be conducted in two facilities: an adaptive-wall wind tunnel and a water tunnel. The investigation will utilize an original combination of velocity measurements, time-resolved pressure measurements, and flow visualization to gain new insight into complex aspects of airfoil boundary layer and wake development and to analyze the effect of local active flow control on airfoil performance. In addition to their significance for fundamental fluid mechanics, the results of this work will be directly relevant to a variety of important engineering applications, including the design of wind turbines, micro air vehicles, and gas turbines, as well as aircraft operation at low speed or high altitude. Being essential for designing more effective lifting surfaces and for enhancing airfoil characteristics by means of active flow control, the proposed study will serve to improve overall performance of various engineering systems. Also, experimental results will provide a novel and detailed database for evaluating and improving future computational models.

"The research project outlined below is concerned with the study of convex bodies and belongs to the area known as geometric tomography.  One of the typical questions here is the extent to which knowledge of the size of sections or projections of a convex body yields information about the body itself. The main theme of this proposal is the study of applications of harmonic analysis to convex geometry. One of the earliest such applications goes back to A. Hurwitz's 1901 note on the use of Fourier series to prove the isoperimetric inequality. More recently, A. Koldobsky pioneered a Fourier transform approach to sections of convex bodies, which led, in particular, to an analytic solution to the Busemann-Petty problem.



The basic idea is to express such geometric quantities as the areas of sections or projections of convex bodies in terms of the Fourier transform of certain functions associated to the body (the Minkowski functional or the curvature function, for example). Until recently, such formulas were known only for centrally symmetric bodies. My goal is to extend this theory to cover the non-symmetric case. These techniques will be applied to questions of unique determination of convex bodies and non-symmetric versions of the Busemann-Petty and Shephard problems. I will also study various classes of convex bodies that are naturally associated to the Busemann-Petty problem and Shephard's problem and their generalizations. 



I also intend to use the Fourier transform in the study of convexity in non-Euclidean spaces and problems from asymptotic geometric analysis.

"Phagocytes are cells named for their ability to engulf or ""eat"" particulate material via the process of phagocytosis.  They function in a diverse array of essential tasks throughout the body, operating at the frontlines to protect the body against invading microbes and also performing numerous housekeeping functions that are necessary for normal growth and maintenance of health.  The phagosome is the organelle that is formed within the phagocyte following phagocytosis and is charged with the task of processing the engulfed material appropriately. In primitive phagocytes, such as the amoeba, this organelle serves as the ""stomach"" of the cell and acts to efficiently and completely digest its contents for cellular nutrition.  In phagocytes of higher order organisms, however, the phagosome can be charged to perform a multitude of precise functions, many of which rely on controlled or partial deconstruction of engulfed material.  We have evidence to suggest that phagocytes can quickly adapt the enzymatic composition within the phagosome that creates a custom mixture that best suits the task at hand.  This higher order of control allows one cell type, such as the tissue macrophage, to be capable of performing numerous tasks within the body.  The planned research aims to uncover the scope of this control and the intracellular signaling that orchestrate this process.  This fundamental study will be relevant to the research into diseases such as tuberculosis and atherosclerosis, and may also impact the future design of vaccines and drug delivery technologies.","Cellular control and mechanisms that mediate selective hydrolase recruitment to the phagosome","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Intra-cellular targeting"

"Hurricanes and tornadoes are two of the most violent natural phenomena in the atmosphere. For hurricanes, a major problem is to forecast the intensity change of the storm. For tornadoes, the most pressing issue is to forecast how tornadoes form in severe convective systems. 

     Diabatic heating due to moist convection in the eyewall of a hurricane can affect hurricane intensity in two ways. First, latent heating released in microphysical processes represents a main source of energy for the storm. The vertical distribution of latent heating is known to affect hurricane intensity. Second, latent heating in the eyewall produces a hollow tower of potential vorticity (PV) in the lower to mi-troposphere. This PV distribution supports propagating vortex Rossby waves which may become unstable to mix eyewall PV into the eye to effect intensity change. 

     For the genesis of tornadoes, we hypothesize that tornadogenesis can be initiated from small vortices arising from horizontal shear instability along an outflow boundary separating the cool air of the rear flank downdraft of a supercell storm and the warm environmental air. These vortices can interact with the upper level mesocyclone to spawn a tornado through vorticity stretching and vortex merger.

     We will answer the following answers by simulating hurricanes and tornadoes using a high-resolution computer model and perform diagnostic studies on the model output:

a) How microphysical processes regulate the distributions of latent heating and water loading to affect hurricane intensity? 

b) How vortex Rossby waves and PV mixing affect short-term (~48h) hurricane intensity change?

c) How valid is the proposed hypothesis for tornadogenesis in observed tornadic storms?

     The research program will improve our understanding of hurricane intensity change and the mechanism for tornadogenesis. It will help in the forecasting of these violent systems.

"Sugars and amino acids are the key components responsible for the generation of distinctive aroma and color of food products subjected to thermal processing. Many unpleasant-tasting raw foods can be transformed by the interaction of sugars and amino acids (known as Maillard reaction) into desirable products via processes such as bread baking, coffee roasting and chocolate manufacture. The same chemical interaction is also responsible for the thermal generation of food toxicants during cooking such as heterocyclic amines, acrylamide, furan and glycotoxins. They are formed in food during processing through thermal degradation of proteins in the presence of sugars and can be a source of health concern due to recently identified link between the levels of consumption of foods rich in glycotoxins (such as fried, grilled vs boiled) and diseases associated with aging. Understanding the mechanism by which the important toxicants are formed in food, can contribute to our ability to control their generation. Finding optimal conditions to lower the levels of different toxicants and at the same time retain the Maillard-derived aroma compounds and hence improve the quality and safety of foods, is one of the main challenges of the food industry today.

This grant application aims at elucidation of the mechanism of formation of important Maillard reaction products through the use of stable isotopes and model systems.

"Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are devices that are designed to implement digital systems. They are optimized for hardware algorithms and have the added advantages of being able to change their functionalities in a fraction of a second. Being both hardware-oriented and programmable, FPGAs provide a unique blend of performance and functionality that is essential to many applications. With over 80,000 design-starts and $4 billion in sales annually, FPGAs have become one of the most popular computing media.

     The programmability of FPGAs has made their design particularly challenging. Typically only 25% of FPGA area is used to perform computation. The remaining 75% is used to connect the computing elements together. Consequently, the design of FPGA interconnects can be as important as the design of the computing elements.

     The goal of this research is to increase the area and power efficiency of FPGA interconnects. Virtually all existing investigations in the field have dealt with computing elements that process one bit of information at a time. Modern FPGAs, however, also contain elements that are designed to process multiple-bits of information simultaneously. The increased use of these multi-bit processing elements has introduced new unexplored aspects and variables to the problem.

     In this work, we will focus on two unique properties of the multi-bit processing elements --- the correlated behaviours of their signals and their size variation. First, we will take advantage of the correlated behaviours to exploit the shift capabilities of interconnects for area and power efficiency. Then, we will investigate the most efficient method of connecting computing elements of various sizes together. Finally, we will study how the single-bit processing elements can be grouped into multi-bit processing units to improve the efficiency of their interconnects.","Area and power efficient interconnect architecture for multi-bit processing on FPGAs","Computer communications",CANADA,CANADA,"Vlsi systems"

"The Internet is a revolutionary technology that changes our life dramatically. Business and individuals have benefited much from traditional Internet applications, including email, www, etc. The Internet has evolved over the past decades. Nowadays, it is moving forward in several aspects. In terms of access technology, relatively low-rate asymmetric access (such as the 1.5 Mbps ADSL) is migrating to high-rate symmetric technologies (such as the 50 Mbps VDSL2). In terms of Internet applications, more and more real-time applications, such as large-scale online gaming and online interactive television, are emerging. Despite the popularity of the Internet, network malfunctions are not uncommon. Physical failures are relatively frequent in the fiber-optic networks that form the core of the Internet: a top-tier carrier will, on average, experience one fiber failure every three hours. Of course, simple congestion events are even more common than failures. Thus, network resilience, the ability to recover from network malfunctions, has been a very important issue in the Internet. Most of the existing resilience mechanisms were designed for non-real-time applications with low-rate access. With the migration from low-rate access to high-rate symmetric technologies and the appearance of more and more real-time applications, the resilience mechanisms in the Internet need to evolve accordingly. Our research is focused on efficient resilience mechanisms for real-time applications in the transitioning Internet. Our vision is that the mechanism to be proposed would be a ""multi-layer"" approach.","Multi-layer resilience for real-time applications in high-speed networks","Computer communications",CANADA,CANADA,"Communications networks"

"This proposal is to request funds for the acquisition of a solvent purification system, which is urgently needed to support Dr. Ye's innovative research program on olefin polymerization and novel polyolefin materials being carried out at Laurentian University.  The requested solvent purification system is used to remove trace amounts of water and oxygen, which are often present in regular-grade solvents, to produce dry, deoxygenated high-purity solvents with water and oxygen concentrations reduced to sub-ppm level.  



In Dr. Ye's research, flammable organic solvents are extensively used in olefin polymerization processes as polymerization media and in synthesis of transition metal olefin polymerization catalysts.  Due to the highly oxophilic nature of most metal catalysts for olefin polymerization, the use of high-purity solvents with significantly reduced water and oxygen are critical to the success of catalyst synthesis and olefin polymerization.  The requested solvent purification system is equipped with purification columns packed with various molecular sieves, which effectively and spontaneously adsorb water and oxygen present even at trace levels in the solvents to be purified.  The requested purification system provides a much safer, faster, and more convenient way to obtain high-purity solvents whenever needed.



This requested system will be the first of its kind at Laurentian University.  Given the large quantities of various high-purity solvents being consumed in Dr. Ye's research lab, the award of such a purification system will significantly enhance the work efficiency of Dr. Ye's team and help Dr. Ye establish a strong leading edge polyolefin research program at Laurentian University.

"Owing to the drive for more fuel-efficient, lighter, and smaller engines with longer lifetime for modern automobiles and machines that can operate in extreme conditions, engine lubricants have to meet increasingly stringent requirements to match the high demands and to offer tangible performance and economic benefits.  Synthetic lubricants, formulated from synthetic base stocks of uniform and well-defined molecular structures, have shown outstanding performance advantages compared to conventional lubricants based on mineral base oils from petroleum, which have undesired complex compositions and broad distributed performance properties. Owing to the severe competition from other base stocks and increasing market demands on lubricant performance, the synthetic lubricant industry is driven to develop and market next-generation, high-performance synthetic base stock technologies to remain competitive in the global market.  

       In collaboration with the supporting company, Imperial Oil Ltd., this project is aimed at developing a new synthetic lubricant base stock technology based on molecularly-engineered low-molecular-weight dendritic polyethylenes.  Chain walking ethylene polymerization techniques with the use of late-transition-metal Pd-diimine catalysts will be developed and employed for tailor synthesis of this novel range of base stocks of uniform and well-defined polymer molecular structures and performance properties.  The unique compact dendritic polymer chain architecture is expected to impart these base stocks with superior viscosity/rheological properties, and render them highly promising for application as new high-performance synthetic base stocks.

       If successful, the base stock technology to be developed in this project may have great potential for applications in Canada's strategically important oil/lubricant industry.  The fundamental knowledge to be generated in this project is also believed to provide the industry a key to newer and better synthetic base stock technologies.

"Reducing the energy required to move people and products is one of the biggest long-term challenges that the transportation industry faces in Canada and worldwide. High-performance polymer nanocomposite materials reinforced with inorganic nanofillers have attracted tremendous attention from the transportation industry as a novel class of lightweight yet strong structural materials to replace metals for energy savings. However, the performance and broad technological utilization of polymer nanocomposites have been restricted by the lack of effective methods to achieve uniform nanofiller dispersion and strong nanofiller-polymer interactions, which are key to nanocomposite performance properties. This proposed project is aimed at improving Canada's competitive position in the development and  utilization of lightweight polyolefin nanocomposites for the transportation industry. The anticipated outcome of this project is an advanced polyolefin nanocomposite technology, surface-initiated living olefin polymerization technology, for making high-performance polyolefin nanocomposites of outstanding mechanical performance. This technology will provide nanocomposites featured with more uniform nanofiller dispersion and stronger nanofiller-polymer interactions. If successful, these value-added nanocomposite materials are anticipated to have wide applications in the transportation industry.

In addition, the new surface-initiated living olefin polymerization technology to be developed is believed to be of great technological significance to the area of olefin polymerization and may provide Canadian polyolefin industry a key to more valuable products.

These materials are useful in a vast range of industrial or commercial applications, e.g. as nonvolatile random-access memory devices in future computers, 'smart' sensors and actuators for active control of vibration or noise, high-resolution ultrasonic probes for medical imaging, diagnosing and treatment, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). The ferroic and multi-ferroic properties essential to these applications result from the microscopic and nanoscopic crystal chemistry of materials, i.e. the nature of constituent ions and chemical bonding, the atomic and spin arrangements (nuclear and magnetic structures), and the related phase components and transitions. Therefore, understanding the relationship between micro-/nanoscopic structure and macroscopic functional properties is central to the ferroic materials research, and it is along this line that our research program is established.

In this program, we will develop new synthetic strategies for the preparation of ferroic materials in the forms of single crystals, ceramics and thin films, and characterize their crystal and magnetic structures (atomic and spin arrangements), dielectric, piezoelectric, ferroelectric and magnetic properties. Complete characterization of the physical properties will allow us to exploit the potentials of the materials synthesized in device applications.

"Quantum field theory describes our universe over an enormous range orders of magnitude and at very high precision.  It is also full of beautiful patterns and structures.  Of particular import for this research program are Dyson-Schwinger equations, which are quantum equations of motion, and Feynman graphs which are graphs that represent increasingly complex ways in which given particles can transition into others.



The goal of this research program is to increase understanding of quantum field theory by furthering combinatorial and algebraic geometric understanding of Feynman graphs and Feynman integrals. In particular, this proposal seeks first to understand the recursive decomposition of graphs into subgraphs along with its analytic avatar, the Dyson-Schwinger equations; and second, to understand the association of graphs with transcendental values through Feynman integrals.

"PRINCIPAL GOAL: The development of a complete geophysical microwave imaging system, with a frequency bandwidth of 1.87 GHz, ranging from 130 MHz to 2 GHz employed to determine subsurface permittivity, which can be used for the inference of subsurface water concentration. The achievement of this principal goal depends on the unique integration of the disciplines of geophysics, electrical engineering, applied mathematics and computer science. 

SCIENTIFIC APPROACH:  Construction and calibration of 2 ultra-wideband antennas and a sensor frame for the acquisition of microwave data in the bandwidth 130 MHz to 2GHz for 2 orthogonal co-polarizations and one cross-polarization. After data pre-processing , data inversion will proceed in two steps. In the first step an initial estimate of  the subsurface permittivity will be input into a finite volume numerical solution of  Maxwell's equations, resulting in a synthetic data set.  In the second step, the least-square error between the measured data and synthetic data will be minimized and updated iteratively, via subsequent synthetic data generation and least square error computation. Upon proper termination of the iteration, an approximate model of the subsurface permittivity will be obtained. 

NOVELTY AND EXPECTED SIGNIFICANCE: A single ultra-wideband antenna will be used to obtain subsurface permittivity data from .13 to 2 GHz, a feat normally requiring the compositing of data from many antennas, which cannot easily be cross-calibrated. The resulting image will have a superior depth resolution due to the impulsive character of the microwave transmission, with weaker reflections becoming more apparent. Consequently stratigraphy will have better definition, resulting in enhanced imaging of cavities (important for site evaluation in civil engineering), fractures (essential  for hydrogeological assessment) and significant hydrogeological boundaries such as the water table.

"Every cell within a multicellular organism, such as a human, contains the same genetic blueprint - so what makes a blood cell different from a muscle cell? The answer is how the genetic material is activated.  Different cell types activate different sets of genes to make proteins that are specific for the function of the particular cell.  For example, a blood cell would produce a protein for carrying oxygen through the body, while a muscle cell would produce a protein that is used for cell contraction.  The process of this differential gene activation is referred to as gene expression.  The control of gene expression occurs at many levels within a cell but the most common level of control is at the initiation of transcription.  Transcription is the mechanism that makes 'photocopies' of particular genes. These copies are called messenger RNA (mRNA), and they serve as the instructions for the production of proteins.  The initiation of transcription is tightly controlled through the orderly assembly of specific factors that recognize and bind to specific DNA sequences in regions called promoters, which precede the beginning of each gene.  I am interested in studying gene expression, in particular the regulation of transcription initiation in the single cell protozoan, Giardia lamblia.  This organism is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in humans worldwide, and is a frequent contaminant of freshwaters in Canada.  Giardia is an eukaryote, like a human cell, because its genes are located in a special compartment within the cell called the nucleus.  However, the regulatory regions for the control of transcription initiation in Giardia are smaller and less complex than those in a human cell, and the number of factors that are required to assemble at these regions before transcription can initiate appears to be greatly reduced in Giardia compared to a human cell. Therefore, the study of transcription and gene expression in Giardia would be an opportunity to identify the bare essentials of these processes in a streamlined biological system.  Moreover, these studies may identify unique aspects of these pathways in Giardia that can be exploited to develop improved and more effective treatments of Giardia infections.","Gene expression studies in giardia lambia","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Gene expression"

"The fundamental concept of classical Fourier analysis is that an essentially arbitrary function may be expressed as a linear combination of exponentials. The philosophy is to decompose a function space into subspaces for which the question we wish to answer (eg. solving a differential equation) is tractable.  A simple example of this philosophy is diagonalizing a matrix:  the effects of multiplying a vector by a matrix are easy to understand on eigenspaces. In the 1930s, I.M. Gelfand introduced a broad programme in abstract harmonic analysis which generalized this philosophy to permit the transfer of difficult problems in diverse areas of mathematics such as analysis and topology to more tractable problems in algebra. An unresolved component of Gelfand's programme is the classification of the irreducible unitary representations of a group, known as the unitary dual problem. A solution to the unitary dual problem has applications in many areas of mathematics such as automorphic forms, class field theory, and number theory, and also in physics (particularly quantum mechanics).



The unitary dual problem is the major open problem influencing the questions in representation theory which I study.  I propose to work towards a solution to this problem for real reductive Lie groups and for algebras used heavily by physicists such as Virasoro algebras and double affine Hecke algebras.  Specifically, I will compute signatures for invariant Hermitian forms on highest weight modules and Harish-Chandra modules, I will develop a theory for the combinatorial objects which have arisen already in the study of these objects,  and I will study the structure theory of generalized Verma modules using techniques from algebraic geometry.

"Our research activities focus on the behaviour of metallic magnetic microwires and nanowires.  The work on microwires focuses on giant magnetoimpedance, the extremely high (100s of %) changes in electrical impedance produced by small changes in magnetic fields.  The response when the current is small is now reasonably well understood.  We are working primarily on non-linear effects, and on the magnetic noise, which is the ultimate limitation on the application of these effects in sensors.   The study of nanowire arrays is a relatively new field, and we have developed a simple picture of the interaction fields produced by the wires and acting on the others.  Much remains to be understood concerning their domain structure and magnetic reversal processes.  Their high frequency behaviour is of considerable interest.   We are also working on the subject of multiexcitation entropy.

"Comprehensive planning problems prove particularly complicated when their system components exhibit considerable degrees of uncertainty. This complexity is frequently compounded by numerous stochastic elements that cannot be definitively ascertained beforehand.  Often precise analytical formulations do not exist and, even when they do, contain a multitude of highly stochastic, non-linear components. Determining good solutions to such large stochastic problems, while simultaneously incorporating the inherent uncertainties, can prove exceedingly difficult.  Irrespective of such difficulties, this planning must be performed in virtually every sphere of ""real world"" decision-making, planning, and policy-formulation. 

     Simulation-optimization (SO) provides an optimization approach that incorporates uncertainties expressed as probability distributions for constructing best solutions to complex planning problems. In SO all unknown objective(s), constraints, and parameters are replaced by simulation models in which the decision variables provide the settings under which each simulation experiment is run.  An efficient optimization component guides the solution exploration through the feasible domain performing only a limited number of simulations. 

     While some of my earlier reseach has demonstrated that SO can produce impressive results in large-scale planning applications, the solution time/quality of the procedure can vary considerably from one implementation to another - thereby limiting its overall applicability for all planning purposes.

     Approaches for improving the performance of SO by decreasing the solution time and/or producing better quality solutions will be investigated and improved search procedures will be sought.  Ancillary  techniques will be incorporated into SO to accelerate its convergence to good solutions and to help guide/accelerate its solution searches. Numerous ""real world"" applications will be considered and extensive testing will be employed to ascertain SO suitability within disparate planning environments.  These applications all possess considerable public and environmental importance.

"The development of bioinformatics databases has led to the demand for analytical systems capable of handling very small samples but still being able to provide information on specific biomolecules contained within the samples. During the past decade, processing of biological samples for these purposes is automated, at a small-scale, and high-throughput operation with lower cost but without compromise in accuracy. The ability to miniaturize biomedical devices to the order of micrometers has created a new paradigm based on which drug development, biotechnology development, genetic analysis, and clinical diagnosis and treatment are performed The development of Lab-on-a-Chip devices using microelectromechaical systems (MEMS) and nanotechnology has enabled the miniaturization and integration of multiple molecular diagnostic systems. The proposed project will focus on the development of a Lab-on-a-Chip device to perform multiple functions, such as on-chip cell separation, cell lysis, biomolecular separation and real-time PCR.

"The ability to create functional items relies on the availability of adequate materials and the access to appropriate tools. The knowledge to exploit fundamental properties of new materials as well as the experience of manipulating tools will allow building of things that are relevant to our existence or comfort - from simple mechanical structures to highly sophisticated electronic devices. Therefore, as new materials or novel technologies emerge, new knowledge needs to be generate so that the materials or technologies can be utilized for the benefits of the society. New tools or innovative manipulation mechanisms need to be invented to engineer the materials into functional devices. There is a strong emergence of nanoengineering due to the increased understanding of fabrication and assembly techniques, and an ability to exploit the unique mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of nanomaterials. Equipped with this fundamental understanding of micromachining and nanotechnology, this research program will focused on the development of micro/nanodevices for real-world applications.

"How materials self-organize into ordered structures, and how they get stuck in disordered states are among the most profound problems in condensed matter and biophysics. Monodisperse colloids in suspension can be conceived of as ""big atoms"" to study these fundamental problems. Self-assembly in colloids closely mimics thermodynamic phase behavior in atomic fluids. Tunability of colloidal interactions allows one to ""tune"" the colloidal free energy: external fields can tune the energetic contributions to the free energy while size and shape polydispersity can be used to control the entropic contributions. 



New forms of experimental control lead to novel phenomena. In this proposal, complementary experimental techniques will be combined with an unprecedented control over interparticle interactions (via novel electric field geometries) and polydispersity to create novel equilibrium microscale and nanoscale colloidal structures, with applications in materials science and biophysics. Electric fields will be used as thermodynamic variables to traverse colloidal phase transitions, providing insights into fundamental non-equilibrium problems in condensed matter, such as the kinetics of crystallization and the glass transition. 



We are studying colloidal suspensions in novel electric field geometries as well as anisotropic liquid-crystalline media in order to achieve greater control over crystal formation and impurity defect suppression. This will allow us to obtain more detailed information about kinetics in rare, extremely quick or extremely slow processes (crystal nucleation, crystal growth and the glass transition). External fields also enable us to make new kinds of nano-patterned materials, with applications as magnetic films, photonic crystals or electrorheological fluids. Advances in this field will thus result in materials with improved functionality.

"It is well known that oil and water do not mix.  However, if an appropriate concoction of surfactants (similar to soap molecules) were added to the system, it is possible for the immiscible liquids to blend on the nanometre scale, effectively forming a homogeneous solution.  This blending of oil and water can find important applications in such diverse areas as oil sands engineering, food science, and drug delivery.  The physical property which controls the nano-scale blending of oil and water is the bending stiffness of the interface (i.e. the dividing surface between oil and water).  In this project, novel micromechanical techniques will be developed to quantify the bending stiffness of the liquid interface.  The experiments will be conducted on the micrometre length scale (about one tenth the thickness of a human hair), and the procedure will involve analysing the random fluctuations of a very flexible interfacial surface.  By balancing the randomizing effect (temperature) with the restoring force (bending resistance of the interface), it is possible to calculate the bending stiffness of the liquid interface.","Bending elasticity of adsorbed oil-water interfaces:  direct measurement and relevance to oil sands engineering","Oil, gas and coal",CANADA,CANADA,"Chemical engineering"

"Apical meristems are located at each growing point and are specialized for the production of new cells for the plant body.  The importance of meristems in plant growth and development can be summarized by a simple statement from Professor Ian Sussex's review ""The meristems make the plant"" (Cell 56: 225, 1989). In the past funding period, we demonstrated that shoot meristem initiation is sensitive to auxin perturbation.  Furthermore, during in vitro embryogenesis, although a shoot meristem is formed, it is not stably determined as its organization deteriorates upon prolong culture. The root meristem, on the other hand, requires auxin for development. These observations suggest that expression of the meristem genes and hence the cell fate could be altered by auxin levels and factors from the embryonic environment. We also established that the redox state of both the cell and its surrounding environment can modulate in vitro embryo development.  The redox environment can influence the quality of the embryos produced, especially the shoot apical meristem. 

There are still many important, unanswered questions regarding meristem initiation and its determination process.  At present, we have in our collection a number of Arabidopsis meristem-related enhancer-trap lines with GUS (beta-glucuronidase) as the marker gene.  In the next funding period, we will make use of these enhancer-trap lines to study meristem formation and the role of auxin and other medium additives during in vitro development.  The advantage of using the GUS marker gene is that once this gene is subsequently translated, we can stain for the enzyme activity which gives a blue color.  By studying changes in the color pattern, we can study the activities of various meristem genes during the course of meristem development.  We will further investigate the importance of the redox environment on embryo development.  The white spruce system will be used. The role of the redox compounds, i.e. reduced and oxidized glutathione on embryogenic tissue proliferation and programmed cell death will be studied using histological, histochemical, and biochemical methods.

"The goals of this research are to develop novel and rigorous statistical methods to handle complex models that are required to characterize various disease progression processes. The proposed methodology will lead to valuable new insights into many aspects of medical research and will be of great interest to medical and biostatistical researchers. Specific areas to which I intend to contribute are described as follows.



1. Missing Data in Longitudinal Studies: In longitudinal studies missingness is inevitable and this presents a challenge to standard inference methods. The growing literature and emerging lexicon have helped raise awareness of the impact missing data can have on inferences regarding treatment and other covariate effects. I plan to continue my research in this area to explore challenging problems and to develop inovative methods.



2. Measurement Error in Life History Data: In medical studies it often happens that some collected data are subject to measurement error. When carrying out statistical inference in such a setting, it is important to account for the effects of mismeasured covariates; otherwise, erroneous or even misleading results may be produced. I intend to develop valid inference methods to account for measurement error in covariates for a wide range of problems concerning survival data, recurrent data, and longitudinal data.



3. Multi-State Models for Chronic Disease: To understand complex diseases which are influenced by multiple factors, it is common to study the multi-state life history processes of individuals from some population. I plan to develop flexible and powerful analysis methods to address complex structures of various disease progression processes.

"A randomized clinical trial is an efficient tool to draw a valid conclusion on a new medical intervention to benefit future patients outside the trial (collective ethics). Balanced randomization is considered as the gold standard in clinical trials. However, this randomization raises ethical concerns because half of the participants are allocated to the inferior intervention and individual ethics is sacrificed. According to the personal care principle, it is difficult or impossible to implement randomization in a clinical trial considering the well-being of patients in the trial (individual ethics). Response adaptive designs are proposed to alleviate the tension between the collective and individual ethics. 



With a response adaptive design, the probability of allocating the next patient to treatments is modified based on the cumulating information on previous treatment allocations and responses of previously treated patients in the trial. The purpose of the design is to deliberately bias the treatment allocation in order to assign more patients to the potentially better treatment. The modification of treatment allocation creates a dependency in the data and the traditional statistical analysis method for independent data cannot be applied without justification. The dependency in data presents a great challenge in searching for an optimal adaptive design.



The proposed research will investigate how response adaptive designs affect the power of statistical tests and propose an optimal response adaptive design in terms of a better way to deal with the tension between individual and collective ethics. Statistical analysis methods will be developed for the optimal design. The potential significance of the research is that the proposed design may serve as a reference design for adaptive clinical trials and may help promote the use of response adaptive designs in practice.

"Controlling how molecules assemble to form functional structures and understanding the dynamics of these assembly processes is fundamental to efforts in fields ranging from materials science and chemistry to structural and cell biology. Arguably, determining the structural and conformational requirements for such interactions is best accomplished by examining these events at the molecular scale, in real-time, and under nominally real-world conditions. In the cell, many events that define its function, structure, and dynamics take place at or within a membrane, involving molecules that interact with or exist within this environment. For example, cell surface adhesion molecules can help a cell bind to, and interact with, other cells, while other molecules facilitate the transport of specific ions into (or out of) a cell, or within organelles in the cell, to regulate specific functions. Signals are transduced into the cell through membrane-bound molecules that are activated by the binding of specific signalling ligands; however, these processes are often cast in very general terms, and the true dynamics and specific molecular-scale events that underpin these processes remain largely unknown, a consequence of the difficulties in determining the structure, conformation, and orientation of the constituent molecules. Our goal is to develop approaches that allow us to directly address these very issues

"To support the growing demand for food production, the usage of agrochemicals, which protect plants from various pathogens and insects in agricultural production, has increased dramatically over the last decades. However, the negative environmental effects of these chemicals are becoming a serious issue all over the world. Furthermore, despite of the extensive use of these agrochemicals, the worldwide crop loss caused by plant disease is approximately $220 billion annually. To address these issues, the generation of pathogen resistant crops and environmentally friendly agrochemicals are essential. For this aim, it is crucial to understand the plant's own natural defense system at the molecular level. During the past decade, extensive efforts have been made to understand the recognition and signal transduction in plant immunity. However, the signal transduction cascade following pathogen recognition is still largely unknown. In order to identify components of the resistance signaling pathway, we have conducted a screening for Arabidopsis mutants which show alterations in pathogen resistance. Through this screen we identified cpr22 that exhibits constitutive activation of various defense responses. In the past four and half years we have identified the cpr22 gene as an unusual chimeric cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel gene (AtCNGC11/12) and reported that the transient expression of AtCNGC11/12 induces Ca2+-dependent programmed cell death. Our data about AtCNGC11 and 12, and the data from other research groups about AtCNGC2 and 4 strongly indicate significant roles of CNGCs in plant immunity. However the molecular mechanism of their involvement in the induction of resistance responses and the CNGC-mediated signal transduction cascade are still largely unknown. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of CNGC mediated signal transduction in plant immunity. The outcome of this proposal certainly will improve our understanding of the role of CNGCs in the plant immune system and also contribute to discover practical solutions for agricultural/environmental issues caused by pathogens and agrochemicals.","CNGC mediated signal transduction and networking in plant immunity","Crop management (pest,disease control and breeding)",CANADA,CANADA,"Plant pathology"

"Deterioration to the health of the environment and ecosystems can have serious consequences for human health. The World Health Organization estimates that water-related illness results in 3.4 million deaths globally per year (Medema et al., 2003), placing waterborne illness as one of the world's most urgent health issues. The burden of waterborne illness affects both developing and developed nations. Water-borne illness remains a significant threat to the health of Canadians, and in particular to those residing in rural regions. Nationally, gastroenteritis from verotoxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter are estimated to occur as high as 3.3, 6.9, and 19.3 per 1000 population, respectively (Thomas et al., 2006). Increasing demands on agriculture production (ie intensive livestock operations), changes to fertilizer practices, and climate change are all forecast to negatively impact water quality in Canada. To prevent future Walkerton and North Battleford-like outbreaks we must minimize fecal contamination of water sources and better understand the pathogenic risks associated with fecal contamination. Therefore new approaches are urgently needed to quantify specific sources of fecal contamination and accurately predict the human health risks associated with these sources of fecal pollution. The outcomes of the proposed research will help guide policy decisions for measuring risks of pathogen infection associated with fecal pollution as well as provide critical data required for implementing the most effective policies for mitigation of fecal contamination in agriculturally influenced watersheds.","Indicators of fecal pollution in agricultural ecosystems: Persistence and identification of appropriate pathogen indicators",Water,CANADA,CANADA,Bacteriology

"Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for an estimated 1.4 million Canadians. Skeletal loading is known to be protective against bone loss. Despite its critical significance, little is known about the cellular mechanism that allows bone to sense and respond to mechanical loading.

    Loading-induced dynamic fluid flow in bone is one of the biophysical cellular signals that occurs in response to mechanical loading and is believed to be one of the signals that bone cells can sense and respond to with the production of intracellular biochemical signals that are important for bone formation/resorption. Many efforts have been made in studying the effect of loading-induced fluid flow on bone cells. However, conventional loading devices designed for most studies lack the critical geometric and biophysical characteristics of the extracellular environment in which bone cells reside. Therefore, a more realistic mechanical loading system is needed so that mechanotransduction, the mechanism by which mechanical stimulus can be converted into intracellular biochemical signals, in bone cells can be better studied.

   The general theme of the research addressed here is to develop a first-of-its-kind 3D biocompatible micro flow chamber system to mimic the pericellular environment in bone and to study the bone cell mechanotransduction pathway using this system. This will be the first time that the microfabrication technique, biodegradable materials, and a microfluidics system are integrated in a study of cell mechanics that is focused on a sub-micro cellular structure (the bone cell process). This project will require the integration of cutting-edge microfabrication technology with advanced cell mechanics, thus making this project exceedingly unique. In the long term, such a device could be developed into an advanced artificial bone matrix in a tissue engineering application. The multi-disciplinary nature of this research will provide students with training in several new methodologies, including microfabrication, material science, molecular biology, and cell mechanics, thereby preparing them for successful careers in bioengineering.

"People have long been intrigued by shorelines, those places where sea, land, and air all meet. Rocks formed from sediment deposited along ancient shores are quite rare, but where found they can provide invaluable evidence about environments and life forms of the past. My research examines animals that lived in tropical seas along ancient shorelines: members of the phylum Cnidaria (corals and jellyfish) and other associated invertebrates. This work focuses on the Late Ordovician to Early Silurian periods (about 430 to 450 million years ago); this is a significant time period because one of the biggest extinction events in the history of life occurred near the end of the Ordovician. During this extinction, many life forms became extinct in a relatively brief interval of time; the Ordovician extinction was followed by the evolution of new life forms in the Early Silurian.



In the Late Ordovician and Early Silurian, Manitoba was close to the equator, and rocks deposited in shoreline and nearshore environments are found in several areas.  Perhaps the most significant of these occur around Churchill, where sediment was deposited around a chain of tropical islands. I am collaborating with other scientists to see how the fossilized animals in this area differ between nearshore and offshore environments. I am also working with colleagues and students to study unique soft-bodied fossils from northern and central Manitoba, and to better understand the rock layers of central Manitoba.



By providing insights into the climates and geography of ancient times, this work can help us to better understand modern global change. On a more practical level, new information about rock units can be applied to exploration for geological resources, and the improved knowledge of unusual fossils is of interest to educators, tourists, and the public.

"The semiconductor ""chips"" that can be found in all computers, cell-phones, etc. consist of very dense arrays of ""transistors"" that are used to control the flow of electrical current through literally kilometres of tiny wires embedded in the chip.  The voltage pulses applied to each of several million transistors are exquisitely choreographed so that the chip performs the logical operations and data storage required to carry out the instructions written by software engineers.  Although this technology is obviously incredibly powerful, it is not omnipotent, and there are certain tasks that digital electronic circuits are incapable of performing, and many others that they can perform with very poor efficiency.



The research proposed here is aimed at exploring alternate methods for manipulating information in ways that could provide efficient means of solving these other types of problems.  For instance, huge databases might be efficiently searched to extract particular pieces of information, and the transmission of information can be made more secure.  In particular, we plan to develop a new type of semiconductor chip where light, rather than electricity, flows through the ""circuit"", where the transistors are replaced by novel nanostructures, and where the choreography applies to the quantum mechanical state of the circuit.

"The control of the cell cycle, response to environmental stress and maintainenance of internal homeostasis display a high level of conservation in all cell types. Model organisms such as fission yeast can thus be used to investigate problems of significance to all organisms including higher plants and humans. 

    The core cell cycle machinery that controls how and when cells divide is one of the most highly conserved pathways known. The key elements are protein kinases and phosphatases that signal to start or stop the process.  The Cdc25 protein is such an element and serves to control mitosis. It is subject to complex regulation in all cell types. Part of this grant is concerned with how the protein is moved from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and how that is controlled. 

     Stress response includes a number of mechanisms that allow a cell to respond rapidly and in the longer term to potentially injurious conditions. The Ssp1 protein kinase is part of one such mechanism. It is a rapid response system which functions to mobilize and reorganize the actin cytoskeleton at the cell surface to counteract these assaults. In addition it serves to stop the cell from entering mitosis if conditions are not appropriate and thus prevents potential damage to the genome. We are investigating the nature of the signalling and the way in which the cell cycle is arrested.

     Cells maintain a relatively constant internal environment (homeostasis) that is optimal for function. pH control is an example of this. The global mechanism(s) that determines the nature of the internal pH set point is not fully understood. Using a sopisticated fluorescent probe which allows us to accurately determine internal

pH we are genetically screening for mutants that have an altered control point. Identification of the genes involved and the nature of their interactions will help us understand this important process.

"This proposal describes several of the projects planned or ongoing in our labs on design  of chemical probes and optimized proof of concept (PoC) molecules for disease target discovery, validation and drug discovery. An associated project to develop new methods for enantioselective synthesis to facilitate lead optimization is also presented. 1) Leukotrienes (LTs) are implicated in a number of diseases and more recently are postulated to play an important role in inflammatory components of cardiovascular diseases. Inhibitors of LT biosynthesis have been associated with adverse effects which limit their use. A new class of ""anomalous"" inhibitors of leukotriene biosynthesis has recently been discovered whose mechanism of action is not understood. Optimized compounds in this class may exhibit a better chronic safety and tolerability profile. We plan to make affinity probes to identify the molecular target(s) on these compounds in the cell.  Identification will allow a better understanding of the fundamental details of mechanism and controls of LT biosynthesis and the potential of inhibitors in this new class as new therapies. This research will also provide the assay tools necessary to optimize such inhibitors to identify viable development compounds. 2) As many compounds in the class of LT inhibitors have activity associated with a single enantiomer at a quaternary aryl chiral center, we plan to develop new and versatile methods for  direct synthesis of such molecules based on ortho-directed metalation mediated by novel chiral silyldiamines and aminosiloxanes.  Such methods will have broad applicability in organic synthesis. 3) Serine-threonine kinases form a large and highly homologous class of enzymes involved in many cellular processes and implicated in a wide variety of diseases. Selectivity has been an important problem in the development of such inhibitors. We plan to develop tools to assess kinase expression (in normal and diseased tissue) and selectivity of inhibition in cells. These tools will be based on affinity probes derived from the pan-selective kinase inhibitor staurosporine and analogs. Such tools will provide kinase expression maps and enzyme occupancy assays to enable drug discovery and optimization.

"The proposed research is to modify the existing enzymatic kinetic equations or develop new enzymatic kinetic equations for describing various process reactions in an activated sludge process especially for nutrient removal from different types of wastewaters. These newly developed equations will be used to modify the existing ASM and BioWin matrix models, with the objectives to improve the design and operation of biological nutrient removal processes, and to protect aquatic environment and public health by reducing negative environmental impacts attributed to excessive discharge of nutrients into aquatic ecosystems.



The model development or modification will be based on the analysis and derivation of enzymatic reactions, the traditional Michaelis-Menten kinetics and the Monod model. A new parameter that is the ratio of effective enzyme to biomass will be introduced into new or modified enzymatic kinetic equations, which will be the innovative part of the research. The new equations will be validated experimentally by conducting three-phase biochemical experiments in an aerated bioreactor on different types of test solutions. The concentrations of the substrate(s) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) will be measured at different reaction times. The kinetic curves of enzymatic reactions will be plotted and kinetic coefficients will be determined from the kinetic curves. The ratio of effective enzyme to biomass will be interpreted by non-linear regression. The validated modified equations will then be used to modify the kinetic equations in the ASM or BioWin matrix models, and newly developed equations will be added into the ASM or BioWin matrix models. The modified ASM and BioWin models are expected to be more accurate, reliable, operable, and user-friendly when used for retrofit or new design of biological nutrient removal processes. The modified ASM and BioWin models will be used to improve the design and operation of biological nutrient removal processes by improving treatment efficiency and reducing the treatment cost and equipment footprint required.

"Funds are requested to purchase a 90-gallon per minute hydraulic power unit and a servo control system. They will replace the existing hydraulic power unit, which has an inadequate capacity (10 gallons per minute), and an outdated servo control system. The requested equipments will allow utilizing the full capabilities of an existing actuator, creating an adequate loading system that can: (1) achieve a maximum compressive load of 1459 kN and a maximum tensile load of 960 kN, (2) maintain a constant load while making observations and taking measurements, (3) apply dynamic loads, and (4) conduct load-control and displacement-control tests. The limitations of the current testing system are a major hurdle for the research programs of the four applicants. The load requirements for their tests require utilizing the actuator to its full capacity. The new control system allows conducting displacement-control tests, thus providing a critical safety measure for the expected level of loads. The ability to carry out dynamic testing is essential for several research projects, for instance on Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) since their behaviour is affected by the rate of loading. The immediate research programs that require the new loading system include: (1) utilizing the unique properties of SMAs to achieve sustainable structures that need minor repair following exposure to earthquakes, (2) assessing the effect of corrosion on the local buckling stability of steel bridge members, (3) developing a new precast shear wall system that is easier and cheaper to construct, and (4) conducting research on concrete pipes reinforced using hybrid schemes of composite fibre-reinforced polymers and novel alloys, and on ductile ultra-high performance concrete. Technical support and replacement parts are not available for the existing loading system, which puts the research studies of a large number of HQP (listed in Forms 100 of the applicants) at a great risk. The applicants have the necessary funds for the operation and maintenance of the requested equipments. A full-time technician is available to operate, maintain, and manage this critically needed loading system.

"As information and telecom services are increasingly being offered over the internet, security must now be considered from the outset of service conception and design. It is widely recognized that security cannot be achieved by technological means alone. Techniques from Requirements Engineering, an area of software engineering that deals with the relationship between a system and its surrounding environment, can be used to guide the design of software-enabled services, and to deal with the complex security challenges that arise. We aim to develop modeling techniques to facilitate the explicit incorporation of security considerations in the design process - from initial service conception to technical architecture design.  The approach will build on modeling and analysis techniques developed in software requirements engineering, including strategic social actors modeling, scenarios, analysis of threats, impacts and risk, and other techniques. The resulting models also aim to facilitate communication and interaction among business designers, security engineers, and system developers throughout the service and system lifecycle, and to support cross-disciplinary understanding and informed design decision making and tradeoffs.","Strategic modeling for security and design","Information and communication services",CANADA,CANADA,"Information systems design"
"Computer information systems pervade everyday life today - at home, at work, and at play. Not so long ago, a system is typically designed and constructed with a coherent vision by a single development organization, for use within the boundaries of single user organization. In today's open networked world, information systems rely on numerous other systems and services on the network to function properly and effectively. Today's systems cross many boundaries - e.g., to support business transactions, to manage healthcare, to enhance learning, or to play games. They require the cooperation of many software systems and information services created by other software developers, operated by different service providers, and used by people with different interests and organizational affiliations. Systems today are therefore better understood and analyzed using a social paradigm rather than the mechanistic paradigm of the past. A social paradigm is better able to deal with current issues such as privacy, security and trust, rapid business model transformations, and the move to service orientation.

Building on previous work, the project will develop an agent-oriented modeling approach, treating systems and their environments as consisting of autonomous actors with competing as well as complementary interests, coming together to cooperate for mutual benefits and shared objectives. Networks of dependencies among agents are analyzed for opportunities and vulnerabilities. Goal-based reasoning is used to guide the search for alternative configurations of relationships.

The project will produce a high level language notation and associated tools for describing, analyzing, and designing systems, based on social concepts. The project will seek theoretical foundations from social theories, analyze formal properties, and address fundamental issues that hinder practical adoption, benefitting from empirical experience collected from recent work. The research will support efforts towards international standardization.

"Recently, cooperative wireless communication has received tremendous interest as an untapped means for improving performance of information transmission operating over the ever-challenging wireless medium. By exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, cooperative communication allows single-antenna radios to share their antennas to form a virtual antenna array, and offers significant performance enhancements in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), which are gaining importance with the increasing number of potential applications, such as military battlefield communications, disaster relief, autonomous vehicular communications, consumer entertainment, and emergency medicine. Despite the potential vision of cooperative wireless communications in MANETs, several significant research challenges remain to be addressed before widespread deployment of MANETs with cooperative wireless communications become practical, including security methods, cross-layer designs, and resource management schemes. The overall goal of this project is to address these above research challenges by developing, evaluating, and demonstrating novel solutions that will make cooperative wireless communications in MANETs more secure, reliable, and effective; and thereby make their widespread deployment practical and commercially viable. These technologies will be developed through interdisciplinary collaborations between academia, industry, and government research laboratories. Researchers from Carleton University and Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) will work closely with industry partner EION to advance cooperative MANET technologies. For proof-of-concept and technology transfer, a MANET testbed will be developed to evaluate the novel algorithms resulting from the research. This project will provide a solid knowledge base to support the efforts of Canadian industry to develop practical and commercially viable MANETs with cooperative wireless communications.

"Recent advances in wireless communications show that the interactions of different layers play an important role in wireless networks, and cross-layer design is necessary due to the intrinsic characteristics of wireless networks. Although some work has been done for cross-layer design in wireless networks, most of previous work concentrates on a single air interface standard such as a cellular network. However, in next generation wireless networks, wireless devices are equipped with multiple wireless transceivers for different air interface standards to satisfy the different needs for wide area, local area and personal area wireless networks. Moreover, there has been an explosion of interest in cognitive radio for next generation wireless networks, in which wireless devices can sense their environment and adapt to many frequency bands with multiple transmission protocols. In this framework, the need to consider the interactions of different layers in different air interface standards to develop efficient and effective algorithms that optimize the performance of the integrated wireless networks presents significant technical challenges. The objectives of this research proposal are to address important research problems based on this framework. Our long-term goal involves the study of wireless networks with cognitive intelligence over the air interface jointly across physical, data-link, network, transport and application layers. The research methodology of the work will employ mathematical modeling and analysis techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of the novel schemes. We will also ascertain the practicality of our schemes by pursuing experimental implementations and evaluations. The proposed work will contribute to the advancement of wireless networking technologies through the next generation and beyond. Some of the technologies and techniques resulting from the work may impact the evolution of emerging technical standards or lead to the development of new technical standards. Some results may be suitable for commercialization. The proposed research will also contribute to the training of highly qualified personnel in the information technology, communications and wireless networks fields.

"In order to accommodate the urgent computing requirements of the faculty and graduate students in the Department of Statistical and Actuarial Sciences at the University of Western Ontario, we are requesting funds which will be used to replace  30 5-years old workstations for our graduate students and one server, our aging web/email/file server. A total of $58,146.30 is requested.



All faculty involved in this application have new or ongoing research projects that require large-scale statistical computing. All of our graduate students require computing resources for most of their research work. Among 45 available workstations, there are 35 that are close to or over 5 years old. We request quad-core workstations due to their relatively low cost and high computational power. They are suitable for small to medium-sized datasets and computationally intensive jobs. All faculty and graduate students rely on our file server for storing large datasets that  can accessed and analyzed on our Beowulf cluster or SHARCNET anywhere in the world through ssh. In addition, this file server is also used as our web and email server. It is more than 5 years old and is already out of warranty.

 

To replace old workstations, we request funds to purchase 30 quad-core workstations, each with Intel i5 750 2.66GHz CPU, 4GB RAM, and 320GB hard drive. These, together with the 15 existing workstations, will be housed in nine graduate students offices.

"The first part of proposed research is to construct and study residual processes based on nonlinear time series models such as GARCH and related models. The second part is to study unit root tests based on exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The objectives of this research are threefold.



1. Construct and study residual processes based on nonlinear time series models. A residual process is a stochastic process constructed from residuals of a specific model. One such process is the high moment partial sum process (HMPSP). New results for other nonlinear time series such as GARCH-in-mean and cointegrated regressions models will be attempted. Another residual process that will be studied is a modified empirical distribution process. The new approach is to construct empirical distribution processes based modified residuals. Several publications on this subject are expected.



2. Study unit root tests based on exact MLE. The exact MLE has a unique feature that it is always less than 1 and is mainly used in stationary AR(1) time series. Further study is needed in order to find its limiting distribution under integrated AR(1) models with GARCH or other dependence structure errors. Limit distribution of the exact MLE for nearly integrated AR(1) models will be studied as well. Empirical and theoretical studies of the unit root tests are expected to generate several publications.



3. Use R package Rmpi designed by applicant to implement parallel computation based Mackinnon's response surface regression technique. In order to conduct statistical inferences, mass simulation must be computed for different sample sizes and quantiles. A general procedure will be implemented in Rmpi so that users can find out P values and quantiles quickly with highly accurate results. This will lead to one or two publications.

"Biochips are high-throughput analytical tools for fast, quantitative, and simultaneous detection of multiplex biological samples (DNA, proteins, and peptides). In particular, DNA microarrays (also called DNA chips or gene chips), which were the first to be developed, are used for genetic screening, i.e., to identify the nucleotide sequences of mutated genes associated with human disease.



Knowledge of surface chemistry is indispensable for the manufacture of such biochips; many fundamental aspects are common to the different types of these miniaturized devices. For instance, critical factors affecting the detection efficiency of target analytes are the design of probe molecules, their immobilization on the solid support, and the sensitivity of the signal read-out method. Our research is currently targeting the DNA microarrays, with the intent of extending it to more challenging systems (e.g., protein and carbohydrate chips) in the next five years. 



The proposed project will initially focus on immobilization strategies of DNA probes on novel substrate materials (gold and silicon) to achieve optimum surface density, chemical stability, and molecular orientation. The next phase will encompass a study of the thermodynamic and kinetic principles governing biochip design, fabrication, and performance, i.e., we will explore DNA monolayers on gold as model systems to evaluate the effect of environmental condition, probe layer structure, and base-pair mismatch on the efficiency and rate of on-chip hybridization. This will be followed by the structural and electrical characterization of DNA-modified silicon surfaces, and by the exploration of sensitive electrocatalytic methods for monitoring DNA hybridization on chip.

"The objective of this research program is to develop an innovative class of microwave devices for next generation ground and space based wireless communication systems. The research is expected to result in miniaturized high performance RF/Microwave filters and multiplexers.It will truly be a technological breakthrough in the field in the fact that it utilizes the existing dissipation in the device to act favorably  toward communication system performance enhancement. This is a major paradigm shift in the field of filter design, which enables the engineer to design very high quality RF/Microwave filters and multiplexers using very low cost and low volume resonators. The proposed method will have a significant impact in the low power section of the communication system. In this project, we also propose to embed the RF/Microwave filter and multiplexer assembly in a small chip, together with the already existing LNA assembly. This becomes possible by using advanced lossy filter synthesis techniques, combined with tiny amplifiers exploiting RF/Microwave transistors. The outcome will be one integrated circuit chip including both LNA and filters, with tremendous savings in size, mass and cost. The next part of the proposed research deals with  tunable devices. Having manufactured the device on a  single small chip, it then readily becomes an excellent candidate for electronically tunable RF/Microwave filters and multiplexers, which are already of a great interest to the industry. We also propose the use of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology to provide further quality and tunability to these devices. MEMS technology has already shown its potential for tunable RF/Microwave components but suffers from low-Q electrical components. Our proposed techniques in the design of lossy filters/multiplexers can deliberately overcome these issues, while taking advantage of the electronic tunability of MEMS.

On the other hand, error correcting codes play crucial roles for highly reliable communications over noisy channels. 



I. Polyphase Sequence Design for Multicarrier Communications

Polyphase sequences are the sequences of integers in a finite set, which are suitable for variable rate multicarrier communications. The proposed research includes developing new polyphase sequences with various alphabet sizes and good correlation, and studying their correlation and power characteristics for the applications to wireless communications. The achievements of this research will contribute to the performance improvements of future wireless communication systems by reducing mutual interference among multiple users or channels and increasing the efficiency of power amplification.



II. Error Correcting Codes of Short Block Lengths

In wireless communications, the control information of short block lengths contains critical system information and parameters. Thus, it must be protected by a powerful error correcting code and decoded by the fast decoding algorithm. The proposed research includes developing new error correcting codes of short block lengths along with their fast decoding algorithms and studying their properties for practical wireless communications.

"Graph Theory is an old but re-born and energized branch of mathematics. It has grown rapidly since the 1960's due to its wide range of applications in Physics, Biology and Operations Research, especially since the wide-spread usage of computers and communication networks. The introduction of Graph Theory as a working frame has changed the landscape of scientific investigations completely. Graph Theory has become one of the most active branches of mathematics. Computing science also provides a growing opportunity for the use of Graph Theory.  More recently, Graph Theory also became a useful instrument for the study of gene sequences and environment sustainability, management science and logic designing. During the 2006 ICM conference, there were 6 one-hour invited talks related to Combinatorics and Graph Theory, which is clear evidence of the recognition of its importance from the mathematical society.  

  The proposed program is to expand our knowledge on graph factors, matching extension problem and its variations using multiple approaches from different facets of graph theory disciplines and with different techniques. The goals are to benefit knowledge, both for research and education in three aspects:

  1) To understand the structures of proposed problems and to develop decomposition procedure for the purpose of general recursive arguments and possible design of efficient algorithms. This involves generalizing the existing techniques and methods, and creating new analysis tools for the general framework and abstract models; 

  2) The research will deliver a more consistent and universal framework for the potential applications to other combinatorial problems, applied industrial problems and other mathematical branches; 

  3) The accumulation of new knowledge and the sub-problems induced from the program will be a valuable asset for the training of HQP and provide a great research opportunity for involvement of undergraduate and graduate students for engaging in creation and exploration of natural sciences.","Combinatoral problems on matching extension and graph factors","Mathematical sciences",CANADA,CANADA,Combinatorics

"In a nuclear reactor, presence of excessive vibrations of fuel bundles was found responsible for abnormal wear of the supporting structures or pressure tube. Failures of reactor components may lead to the partial loss of production or even complete shutdowns. Maintenance and replacement of severely worn components can be very costly. During operations, a string of fuel bundles are placed inside a fuel channel and are subjected to several sources of excitations including acoustic pressure pulsations, flow induced dynamic forces, etc.  Because of small clearances between fuel bundles structures and the pressure tube, even small amplitude vibrations (fretting) can cause impact and sliding periodically. 

   In this proposal, fretting of fuel bundle structures and contact-impact forces will be modeled for typical CANDU fuel bundles under various operating conditions. Although significant amount of research has been conducted to investigate the mechanisms of fretting, there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of fuel bundle fretting mechanisms for new fuel or existing fuel when operating conditions change. Quantification of fuel bundle vibrations is important for either case.  The Canadian nuclear industry is interested in developing a comprehensive fretting model. Such a model, once validated, will be invaluable for future certifications of new fuel designs by the regulatory authorities. Because of the complex configuration of fuel bundles, and their coupling with fluid flow, prediction of fretting requires dedicated research, rigorous modeling and experimental validation.  The main objectives are to advance understanding of the dynamic behaviors of structures, confined in liquid-flowing pipe, to study the effects of design changes, to aid the nuclear industry in developing a code and standard for fretting. Simulation results can be used to assess wear rate of pressure tube materials at all critical locations. Completion of this research proposal will assist the Canadian nuclear industry in achieving further technical success and certification of new CANDU nuclear fuel.

"In recent years, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the Athabasca River decreased below critical thresholds for aquatic organisms, due in part to point-source loading from industrial waste waters.  Previously calibrated models failed to predict these low DO concentrations, indicating a knowledge gap in our current understanding of important ecosystem processes that control DO concentrations in large ice-covered rivers. The objectives of this project are (1) to gain a better understanding of the factors affecting oxygen concentration in ice-covered rivers, with a focus on sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and ice-cover ratio; (2) to improve year-round DO modeling in the Athabasca River; (3) to assess the extent and magnitude of ecological impacts from low DO events; and (4) to evaluate the effectiveness of oxygen injection as a remedy measure.  A team of experts from a Canadian university, industry and government will take a multi-disciplinary approach to conduct the laboratory and field experiments and study mathematical models to achieve the project objectives.  We expect the results of this project will provide participating Canadian companies with (1) a management tool that can be used to predict the impacts of biological oxygen demand and nutrient loading under variable ambient river conditions, and (2) a model to evaluate the effectiveness of oxygen injection and optimize its operation.  The project will advance our understanding of the relationships between pulp mill effluents, accumulation and diagenesis in surficial sediments, and the dependence of SOD rates on these factors.  The research will continue to develop innovative research capacities, pioneered at the University of Alberta in the prediction of ice cover as well as the use of microsensor and pseudo-in situ core techniques for measuring SOD rates, and to train graduate students with unique expertise relevant to managing northern rivers.

"Oil sands are Canada's important energy resources.  We need to protect the environment during and after oil sands extraction operations.  A major environmental challenge is proper management of the water discharged from oil sands extraction, called tailing.  This tailing water contains sand, fine clay particles and left-over hydrocarbons from the oil sands. Because some of the hydrocarbons are highly toxic, the tailing water has to be managed in a way that is environmentally safe.  With the increased development of oil sands, the current method of tailing management is not sustainable.  We have to find better ways to manage it.



That requires, first, better understanding of the interactions among the fine clay particle, the hydrocarbons, and the microorganisms existing in the tailing water.  Then, effective engineering solutions can be developed and tested. Scientists have found that the right bacteria could speed up the settling of the fine clay particles and help the process that make the hydrocarbons safe to the environment.  But, it turns out to be a very complicated process.  We have built a unique Microsensor Laboratory at the University of Alberta.  In this laboratory, we will study how to make a set of very small sensors, called microsensors, which can be used to measure the activities of these bacteria.  We will then use these microsensors to study the interactions of the microorganisms in the tailing water and to find out better engineering solutions for the problem.

It has been increasingly recognized that not only are the capacity theorems of network information theory ideally suited in providing a theoretical framework for the physical-layer design of communication systems, they also play an instrumental role in providing practical engineering insights for networking and content-distribution protocols at the network and application layers. The proposed research program aims to gain fundamental insights into long-standing capacity problems in network information theory by focusing on the following areas. First, the proposed research will investigate capacity limits and develop practical coding and modulation strategies for wireless cooperative communications. The proposed research will take advantage of recent advances in error-correcting codes and in statistical physics to develop capacity-approaching strategies for multiuser channels, such as the broadcast channel and the relay channel. Second, the proposed research will address the computation of capacity limits in network information theory using convex optimization techniques. This is especially important in practical wireless multi-antenna communication scenarios where many degrees of freedom in transmitter design are available. Finally, novel multiuser channel models inspired by networking problems will be formulated, and insights gained from the study of capacity and coding for these channels will be used to address the design of practical networking protocols. Together, the overall research program aims to tackle theoretical issues in multiuser communication, and to gain fresh insights into the nature of information flow in a network.

"The query optimizer, as one of the most important and most complex database system components, is key to the management of large databases.  Its major task, query optimization, is to choose the best way to execute a query. Often there are several different ways (execution plans) to perform a given query, which might differ in the indices used, the orders of operators executed, etc., but all lead to the same correct result. The query optimizer generates and examines the candidate execution plans, and makes the decision as to which plan to follow for execution. The quality of the optimizer is very important, because costs of plans can vary dramatically and choosing a bad plan might result in extremely poor performance.



Most existing approaches to query optimization aim at choosing the execution plan with the least estimated cost. However, in many cases, this is insufficient, as other qualities, such as robustness and predictability, can be equally important. Like many real-life decision making problems, query optimization inherently involves risks and uncertainties, which must be taken into consideration when choosing a plan.  



The primary goal of our research is to develop systems, methods, and techniques that can effectively utilize various sources of information available in a database system, in order to reduce the risk and uncertainty of query optimization decisions, and make query processing more robust and predictable.

"The 3D incompressible Euler equations is one of the most challenging partial differential equations facing scientists and engineers today. It was proposed in 1755 by L. Euler to describe the motion of incompressible inviscid fluids. Despite its long history, answers to many basic questions are still missing. The applicant plans to work on the following two open problems: 



1. The singularity problem: Whether classical solutions starting from smooth initial data will become singular in a finite time or not; 

2. Onsager's conjecture: Whether weak solutions are related to the physical phenomenon of turbulence.



In recent years, it has been revealed by various authors, including the applicant, that certain geometric properties of the flow play an important role in both problems. In the proposed research, the applicant plans to study the above problems via analyzing the evolution of various geometrical quantities of the velocity and vorticity vector fields, and consequently obtain deeper understanding of how the dynamics of these quantities affect the possible formation of singularities as well as the dissipation of energy. 



The outcome of the proposed research will greatly help the resolution of the above two problems, and deepen the understanding of not only the 3D Euler equations, but also a wide variety of partial differential equations related to fluid mechanics. Progress in the mathematical theory of these equations can in turn guide industrial activities such as oil drilling and help understanding natural phenomena such as hurricane and tsunami.

"Passive wireless microsensors including transponders are microsystems that harvest their operation power from radio-frequency waves sent by a base station known as interrogator. The absence of bulky batteries significantly not only reduces the physical dimension and implementation cost of these microsystems, but also removes the need for maintenance. As a result, these microsystems can be embedded in products permanently or implanted in living bodies to either provide a unique identification that distinguishes from others or provide the precision detection of the parameters of products that otherwise cannot be attained. The emerging applications of passive wireless microsensors include implantable bio-MEMS pressure sensors, implantable retinal prosthetic devices, swallowable capsule endoscopy, multisite pressure sensors for wireless arterial flow characterization, embedded micro-strain sensors for product performance and safety monitoring, wireless temperature sensors for human body and environmental monitoring. Passive wireless transponders have been used as radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags for object tracking in logistics automation and replacing bar codes in retailing, warehouse inventory automation, e-tickets, e-passports, to name a few. The intrinsic attributes of passive wireless transponders including small size, battery-less operation, programmability, low-cost, and wireless accessibility also make them a viable choice for low-cost high-security product authentication keys to avoid the difficulties and high cost of conventional product authentication means such as holograms, watermarks, invisible barcodes, security threads, chemical, and DNA markers. The objective of the research program is to develop low-cost high-reliable high-security passive wireless microsensor systems including passive wireless transponder systems for emerging applications in healthcare, product quality control, product authentication and counterfeiting, object tracking and assess management, security, logistics and warehouse automation, file management, etc. and capitalizing research findings in the form of technology transfer to Canadian industry.

"Integration of XML Data with Relational Database Systems



The proposed research is to develop an efficient schema for integrating XML data and relational database systems, and to evaluate the performance of various XML database systems.



Various schemas have been proposed to store and query XML data in a relational database by converting XML data into a set of tuples stored in relational tables. However, the querying performances of these existing approaches are still far from satisfactory, especially for large XML documents. 



We have developed a new integrating schema, called Xregion, and an effective concurrency control schema based on formula locks. We believe that combining the Xregion and formula lock provides an efficient integrating schema for XML database systems. 



In the proposed study, we will first develop an experimental database management system using Xregion for threading XML data and formula lock for concurrency control. We will then evaluate the performances of various XML database systems under multiple user environment.","Integration of XML data with relational database systems","Information systems and technology",CANADA,CANADA,"Database management"

"Risk-informed infrastructure engineering is a newly emerging engineering discipline that attempts to provide a holistic and life-cycle solution to the ""crumbling infrastructure"". The proposed research program aims at developing an advanced risk-informed in-service inspection (RI-ISI) methodology for a nuclear power plant (NPP), a key physical infrastructure system that safety is so important an issue. The advanced RI-ISI methodology integrates risk insights from probabilistic risk analysis with service experience, operating conditions, and other deterministic information to optimize inspection decisions. The proposed research will focus on the following three key and interdependent issues: stochastic degradation modeling, life prediction and reliability analysis, and inspection and maintenance optimization for aging management of NPP components. The stochastic degradation modeling provides reliable degradation model for time-dependent reliability analysis and life prediction, which in turn guides the selection of optimal inspection locations and maintenance strategy. Meanwhile, the well-designed inspection program will provide high-quality degradation data for the degradation modeling. Using stochastic process theory and modern statistical methods, the proposed research will provide a solid theoretical basis for RI-ISI programs of NPP. The novelty of the research is that it provides a thorough treatment of all uncertainties associated with the degradation and integrates it into the reliability analysis and the inspection decision-making. The proposed RI-ISI methodology will enable Canadian utilities to develop more efficient and economical ISI programs that improve the reliability and operational safety of the nuclear power plants. The major findings can also readily be transferred to life-cycle management of other infrastructure systems such as roads, rails, bridges, public transits, and water and wastewater systems.

"The dynamical systems with time delay are of great theoretical interest and form an important class with regards to their applications. Mathematically, these systems are represented by delay differential equations (DDEs). DDEs are used extensively in the modeling of a multitude phenomena in biological sciences, physics, engineering, economics, etc. Stability and bifurcation are the most significant properties in dynamical system since an individual predictable process can be physically realized only if it is stable or quasistable in the corresponding natural sense. Center manifold theory and normal form (NF) method are of fundamental importance in the study of nonlinear dynamical systems, and have been applied in finite-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) broadly. Compared with the great amount of the publications in the study of stability, bifurcation and NF computation for ODEs, there are only few results in that of DDEs. In order to predict and control the long term behavior of real world models, to the mathematicians working in dynamical system, the challenging problems include how time delay and the system parameters affect the stability of the system, and what kind of bifurcations will occur when the stability is destroyed with the variation of delay and parameters. Therefore, it is necessary to extend the theory and methodology to study DDEs deeply and widely, as well as a need to consider the efficiency of the computational methods. This proposal is concerned with developing efficient computational methods for reducing the center manifold and computing the NF of DDEs, then analyzing the stability and bifurcations as the parameters and delays vary, although other aspects will also be involved. It is anticipated that this proposed research will increase our understanding of the dynamical behavior if a system cooperates with time delays. The methodologies developed in this proposed research will have very high potential impact on the nonlinear dynamics community, which will not only strengthen the foundation for theoretical development in a large class of DDEs, but also provide a practical tool for solving real complex dynamical systems.

"The proposed research seeks to identify and characterize the protective antioxidant and other biological activities of unique components from edible seaweeds harvested from the east (Grand Manan, NB; NS, PEI)  and west (Bamfield, B.C.) coasts of Canada. These seaweed components can potentially inhibit lipid oxidation in processed foods to increase their safety and stability; and play a role in reducing diet-related chronic disease risk factors in breast or colon cancer studied using animal models. We have published data on the antioxidant activities of extracts from edible seaweeds including dulse (P. palmata) and various kelps (Laminaria, Macrocystis, Nereocystis sp.). We also reported that one of the antioxidant activities of dulse extracts was related to the level of UV- exposure during growth. Dulse extracts exhibited greater antiproliferative activity compared to those of the kelps in cell culture. Recently, we identified mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) unique to red algae, in dulse and demonstrated differences in the MAAs of samples exposed to varying amounts of UV-irradiation during growth. In this proposal, we plan to: a) use chromatography to confirm the identity and isolate 'gram'  quantities of MAAs from dulse, Irish Moss and False Irish Moss to use in antioxidant and cell culture studies since these compounds are not available commercially; b) use new and established antioxidant assays to determine the effectiveness of crude red algal extracts and purified MAAs; c) study the antiproliferative activity of crude red algal extracts and purified MAAs against colon and breast cancer cell lines and their influence on cellular enzyme systems such as the oxidation pathways; d) determine whether dietary MAAs are absorbed and enter the circulation in animal models; e)study the effects of dulse diets on breast cancer in rats and determine if these effects are related to red algal MAAs, or other components such as the fibre. These studies will train 3 MSc, 1 PhD students & a technician in a leading area of Functional Food research with application to the food industry, particularly the Maritimes, and chronic disease risk reduction.

"The pulp and paper industry is one of the largest manufacturing industries in Canada. Bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp (BCTMP), often referred to as high-yield pulp (HYP), has been increasingly used to replace chemical pulp in fine papers and paperboards as a cost-effective way to improve product performance. Canada produces over 70% of the world's supply of market HYP. Most of the HYP is exported and over half of it is used as middle-ply furnish in folding boxboard (FBB). Facing the growing global competition, Canadian companies need to continue develop and tailor their products to meet their customers' needs in order to stay competitive in the market. 



Currently there is a trend to further reduce the basis weight of folding boxboard. This may cause decreases in some board properties such as bending stiffness. Since folding boxboard is built up of a number of sheets that are pressed together while wet and then dried, the board structure and, therefore the properties of folding boxboard can be varied by choosing different pulp qualities and different amounts of pulp in different plies. However, there is a lack of information on how to optimize the board structure and HYP property to develop a light weight folding boxboard . A solid fundamental understanding and reliable laboratory tools developed for optimizing HYP property and multi-ply board structure will help Canadian HYP producers to develop and tailor their products for a light weight folding boxboard. The present program addresses these needs and will initially focus on optimizing board structure and HYP property for bending stiffness. The research results will directly benefit Canadian HYP producers as well as the users of HYP in Canada. The knowledge acquired from this research will also help promote the use of HYP in other paper grades. The use of high-bulk HYP can reduce the basis weight of the paper and consequently the shipping cost while maintaining the target paper stiffness. This will lead to savings in wood material and reduced environmental impact.

"A number of synthetic students comprising my lab as well as those of Prof. Lautens, Batey, Morris, Chin, and Taylor require access to a dedicated LCMS instrument in order to monitor their reactions and characterize products. The MS detector was purchased when I was hired here at the University of Toronto 10 years ago. At present the instrument is no longer working and, what is even worse, there is no way for us to get a service contract because the manufacturer is no longer supplying the parts. We desperately require a new MS detector. To save costs, we will rely on the old HPLC instrument but we require funding in order to obtain a new MS detector. Between 40 and 60 students need this quite urgently. The lack of this instrument significantly affects their work.

"One of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gases is transport.  One obvious way to reduce the emissions from transportation is by weight reductions.  In this respect, magnesium alloys are very promising, since the density of magnesium is two thirds that of aluminum and a quarter that of galvanized steel, yet has comparable mechanical properties. However, most magnesium components in the auto-industry are in the form of die-cast parts, which is a relatively low percentage of a car, by weight. Wrought magnesium, particularly in the form of sheet, represents a tremendous growth opportunity in the application of magnesium.  The use of magnesium in sheet form is, however, severely limited because of the relatively poor room temperature ductility of magnesium, which necessitates the forming of magnesium alloy sheet at temperatures above ambient.  In the past, the most popular alloying elements have been aluminum and zinc, the most ubiquitous alloy containing 3% aluminum and 1% zinc.  However, this alloy is essentially the workhorse alloy of Mg, and has not been specifically designed for sheet production.  Therefore, the prime objective of this project is to develop alloys for sheet applications, which will be produced by twin roll casting and hot rolling.  The main approach of alloy design will be one of 'microalloying' in which the alloying elements will be chosen on the basis of their effect of the hot rolling behaviour, the formability of the produced sheet, and the properties of the as-formed component.  For economic reasons, the processing route of choice is near net shape casting to a thickness of 6 or 7 mm, and then hot rolling down to about 2 mm.  A laboratory scale processing capability of this type is being established at the Materials Technology Laboratory of CANMET, in Ottawa, part funded by McGill and GM Canada, and will be used to produce the designed alloys.  New alloying and processing concepts and models will be generated and used to design optimised alloys and processing routes.  The facilities of GM research laboratories will be used to evaluate the produced sheet and to manufacture prototype components from optimised sheet.

"Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are widely used in the scientific community. They are used to generate approximate samples from complicated target distributions resulting from statistical and applied probability models. In particular, generic algorithms such as Metropolis and Langevin algorithms are very popular because of the ease of implementations. However, it is well known that choosing the best proposal distribution is not an easy task. Failing to do that can result in an inefficient algorithm and misleading results. My research program will focus on the theory and implementation of MCMC algorithms, typically on unbounded Euclidean state spaces, motivated by distributions such as those encountered in Bayesian inference. The three main objectives of my proposed research program are: 

  1. Bounding the convergence rates quantitatively. I shall generalize and combine available techniques through the application of decomposition theorems, from discrete state spaces, to general state spaces. This work will have direct value for theoreticians working in MCMC and will hopefully unify approaches for estimating and optimizing rates of convergence of algorithms; 

  2. Optimizing the convergence rates by proper scaling of the proposal distribution, when the dimension of the target density approaches infinity. I shall continue to focus on local MCMC algorithms, loosely referring to methods which have increment distributions centered at (or close to) the current state, and on proving weak convergence results for a wider class of target and proposal distributions. This work will extend and refine the scaling guidelines from available theory for all practitioners in the area;

  3. Suggest modifications and study practical implementation issues on some existing sampling algorithms (e.g. MCMC, adaptive MCMC, etc.) widely used in the scientific literature. This includes stabilities of adaptations, convergence and efficiencies of these algorithms, and other problems motivated by practitioners. 

  This work, which is foundational, will enrich the theories of MCMC methods and related extensions.

"The proposed project is concerned with problems at the crossroads of number theory (arithmetic algebraic geometry) and theoretical physics (string theory).

     The objective of the proposed research is to understand the physical prediction of mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau manifolds from a mathematical point of view. A Calabi-Yau manifold is a compact complex Kaehler manifold with vanishing first Chern class and zero first Betti number. Calabi-Yau manifolds of dimension one, two, and three are, respectively, elliptic curves, K3 surfaces, and Calabi-Yau threefolds. Mirror symmetry is a prediction in string theory that certain ""mirror pairs"" of Calabi-Yau threefolds yield identical physical theories. Modular (and quasimodular) forms, Hilbert, Siegel and Jacobi modular forms, and automorphic forms appear, as generating functions of geometric invariants, or as partition functions, or as mirror maps in the mirror symmetry landscape. This gives a strong indication that certain number theoretic and arithmetical properties abound for Calabi-Yau manifolds in mirror symmetry.

     My goal is to interpret the mirror symmetry in terms of arithmetic invariants such as zeta- functions and L-series of the Calabi-Yau manifolds in question. In this regard, the modularity question for the L-series will be vigorously pursued. Here, ""modularity"" refers to the presumed fact that the ""interesting"" part of the L-series arises from a ""modular"" (or an automorphic) form in the context of the Langlands program.

     Also the conceptual understanding of modular properties of partition functions and generating functions of Gromov-Witten invariants, and other geometric invariants on Calabi-Yau manifolds, is one of my central goals. This will involve studying Feynmann path integrals on trivalent graphs, inductive natures of such graphs and their algebraic interpretations via Hopf algebras.

"Decentralization is a necessity in reconfigurable sensor networks and large-scale systems, due to exhaustive computation and communication requirements if the systems were centralized. Such decentralized sensing and control architectures have applications in many areas including environmental detection, rescue operations, traffic management, formation control, and aerospace technology. In such systems, the understanding of the value of partial information and the utilization of it is very critical. The information transfer between the components of such systems can be through bandlimited wireline channels or noisy channels such as the Internet and wireless networks. 



This proposal is on the analysis and design of joint sensing and control policies for such applications. We will provide an understanding based on various disciplines such as distributed control, stochastic control, information theory and graph theory. Stochastic and distributed control and team decision theory provide tools for the optimal control synthesis under limited information. Graphical models provide relationships through objectives and dynamics. Information theory provides limits to what is possible to communicate over channels. However, these fields cannot be analyzed independently: Separation is inherently suboptimal. The notions in information theory are mostly based on asymptotics and hence, entail delay. In control applications, the sensors and controllers should collaborate in real-time. Furthermore, the control policies should ideally scale well with the number of controllers/sensors. This requires an understanding of weak coupling between distant control nodes for optimal control synthesis.  



We expect that our work will let us obtain new insights on various aspects of such control systems, in particular on the value of partial information in decentralized control.","Distributed sensing and control under information constraints","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Control systems"

"The diversity of microbial life is enormous, although exactly how enormous remains a matter of conjecture, since recent evidence indicates that millions of microbial species remain undiscovered.  The past decade has produced a new awareness of this extraordinary diversity, as well as the surprising range of conditions under which microbes flourish. Their metabolic types are equally broad and include a wide variety of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pathways.

     Photosynthesis is a fundamental process that increases the free energy on Earth, therefore research in this field has great importance. The proposed Program will help us not only to better understand the aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic phenomenon, but will also enhance our knowledge of the photometabolism of diverse phototrophic bacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis in novel environments. Development of research in heavy metal transformations will bring in-depth exploration of novel communities and species adaptations. Of particular interest is the metal reducing capacity of vent isolates. The ability to reduce toxic Te or Se oxyanions to the less toxic forms could play an important role in bioremediation of polluted effluents from industrial operations. In addition, such bacteria could prove useful in the applied biometallurgy of rare and expensive Te and Se. Thus our work will make both fundamental and practical contributions.

      The particular objects of the Research Proposal are composed of four interrelated parts: A. Morphological diversity, taxonomic nuances and evolution of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs will be investigated; B. Mysterious aerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic apparatus will be studied; C. Microbiology of the deep ocean hydrothermal vents; and D. Microbial biotransformation of heavy metals is proposed for detailed research.  The approach to be taken includes the use of a variety microbiological, biochemical, molecular genetic, taxonomic and phylogenetic techniques.

"Classical results relating the action of subgroups of matricies on the ring of polynomials have been used to develop a classical theory of invariants and coinvariants.  Inspired by these results, we considered [1] the permutation action on the space of non-commutative polynomials and have begun to develop a theory of non-commutative invariants and coinvariants.  



From this connection between commutative and non-commutative algebras we propose to investigate using the theory of languages a relationship of non-commutative series and classes of commutative generating functions which are studied in enumerative combinatorics.



Arising from a connection with earlier research we are proposing to develop in a group research project a theory of affine Schubert calculus.  Classical Schubert calculus is the outcome of Hilbert's fifteenth problem and is a branch of enumerative algebraic geometry concerned with counting subspaces with certain intersection conditions.  This extension to the classical theory will have implications for mathematicains, physicsts and computer scientists.

"PICASSO* is a Dark Matter search experiment presently installed and taking data in the SNOLAB underground laboratory at Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The quest for the mysterious missing mass of the Universe has become one of the big challenges for today's particle physics and cosmology.  Astronomical observations show that only 1% of the matter of the Universe is luminous and there is now convincing evidence that 85% of all gravitationally traceable matter in the Universe is of a new exotic kind, different from the ""ordinary"" matter surrounding us with its protons, neutrons and electrons. This so-called Cold Dark Matter (CDM) is thought to consist of ""neutralinos"", neutral particles,  about hundred to thousand times heavier than a proton and which interact extremely weakly with each other and ordinary matter. 

The PICASSO dark matter experiment is tuned to the search for neutralinos. It is based on liquid-to-vapor phase transitions which can be induced by neutralino interactions with nuclei in metastable superheated droplets. The PICASSO collaboration has already completed successfully a prototype experiment with a set of low background detectors at SNOLAB in 2005 and the group has published very competitive results in the sector of spin-dependent neutralino interactions on 19-F.

Presently the PICASSO experiment has entered a new stage. With a largely improved set-up at SNOLAB, new read-out electronics, detectors with increased active mass and reduced background, the collaboration is on the way to increase its sensitivity substantially. In this grant request we ask for support for the completion of the present phase with an active mass of 2.6 kg and for feasibility studies for a subsequent 25 kg stage of the project.

"Many formalisms used in theoretical computer science such as database query languages, formalisms for specification and verification, and type systems for programming language semantics use non-deterministic choice functions.  A choice function picks an element from a specified class non-deterministically.  Such formalisms can be fruitfully investigated using logics incorporating a logical choice operator.  Logical choice operators were investigated by Hilbert in the epsilon calculus: in the epsilon calculus, a term of the form epsilon-x A(x) is some x which satisfies A(x), if A(x) is satisfied, and arbitrary otherwise. The epsilon calculus and proof theoretic methods developed for the epsilon calculus have mainly been applied to the proof theoretic analysis of mathematical systems. In recent years, however, it has also been extensively applied in computer science and computational linguisitics. For instance, epsilon operators have been used in dealing with the witness construct in relational database query languages introduced by Abiteboul and Vianu, the choose construct in Abstract State Machines, and as a type foundation for dynamic linking in extensible software systems.



The aim of the project is to expand on previous work in applying the epsilon calculus in computational contexts and to provide a systematic foundation for it. This includes the development and investigation of proof theoretic methods for the epsilon calculus, development of formal systems for various versions of the epsilon calculus, the study of variant semantics for epsilon terms as choice functions in database languages, as well as investigating the behavior of epsilon operators in non-classical logics. In particular, intutionistic epsilon calculi and natural deduction systems for them will be studied: they are a desideratum for applications in programming language semantics, where type inference calculi typically mirror natural deduction systems under the Curry-Howard isomorphism.

"Heating ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in modern buildings consist of a large number of interconnected sub-systems, components and controllers to operate them. In such large systems it is very difficult for the operators to optimize the system operation by trial and error or locate faulty components manually. Inefficient operation coupled with faulty components increase energy consumption, shorten equipment life, and degrade indoor environment in buildings. Since HVAC systems consume nearly one half of total energy used in modern buildings, it is important to develop online strategies for energy optimal operation and diagnosis in order to minimize operating costs. 



Monitoring and control of HVAC systems in modern buildings is currently handled by the state-of-the-art energy management control (EMC) systems. However, most EMC strategies consist of simple heuristic control functions for executing time-of-day building operation schedules. Similarly the diagnostic functions are limited to different alarm levels which are intended for alerting operators to initiate corrective action. Since alarms alone are not enough to detect and isolate component or operation faults. With this as the motivation, a comprehensive research program is proposed to develop online adaptive and intelligent strategies for system operation, control and diagnostics. The  overall objective is to integrate operation, control and diagnostics functions to achieve improved functionality and operational efficiency of overall HVAC system. Experiments will be conducted to verify the developed algorithms in a real building EMC system platform.



The novelty of the proposed research program stems from the fact that the methodology is based on intelligent control techniques and the developed algorithms are expected to contribute to significant reduction in energy consumption and improved operational efficiency of overall HVAC system.

"Insulin, in addition to controlling our body's use of sugars, controls the metabolism and growth of cells in various tissues. It accomplishes this function by modulating the expression of specific genes. Since the genes are present in the nucleus, and insulin operates by binding to receptors on the cell surface, a cascade of events that transduce the signal from the cell surface in to the nucleus must be activated. This study has been designed to examine specific mediator proteins that form part of this signalling cascade. First, we will be identifying members of a novel pathway of this cascade that is required for activation of MAP kinase, a protein that translocates into the cell nucleus and stimulates gene expression. Second, we will examine ADP-ribosylation. This process is controlled by an enzyme that has not been characterized. Furthermore, it regulates a number of distinct pathways, each associated with a different set of genes. Understanding these two processes will greatly enhance our ability to intervene in this system and eventually allow us to selectively target the negative features of insulin stimulation without interfering with its positive functions.","Hormonal mechanisms of gene regulation","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Signal transduction"
"The widespread and ease of use of the World-Wide Web have helped make web-based applications a regular practice in software industry. This practice is even more pronounced when it comes to distributed applications such as electronic commerce and distance learning. With these applications, there is an important need to better understand the user on-line behaviour in order to improve the application (i.e. increase profit in the case of e-commerce, and improve the learning experience in the case of e-learning). Web-based applications track on-line resource accesses in a web access log, which typically becomes very large in size. What distinguish the data that result from web-based activities in general and e-learning in particular are the sheer complexity and the vast size of data, and the fact that simple information extraction is not possible. Relevant information about user behaviour must be deduced by interactive data mining and associated data visualization techniques. This research focuses on devising data mining techniques specific to the context of web-based information systems and in particular with application in e-learning. The research will address issues for (1) off-line data mining (i.e. data mining performed after the collection of data), and (2) integrated data mining (i.e. data mining performed real-time on data streams). The objectives for off-line data mining are to devise new algorithms (such as in clustering, classification, association analysis, sequence analysis, etc.) and new visualization techniques for visualizing website path traversals and resources access and usage to help web designers and educators in the case of e-learning assess analytically the on-line activities and eventually evaluate the users (i.e. learners). The objectives for integrated data mining are to design intelligent software agents that monitor on-line learners activities and dynamically adjust and restructure the online resources accordingly, as well as automatically recommend learning activities to learners based on previous successful learning behaviour of similar learners in the community.","Off-line and integrated data mining for intelligent systems","Information systems and technology",CANADA,CANADA,"Database management"

"In general, estimates face two sources of uncertainty: sampling variability and contamination bias. The study of sampling variability has constituted the main focus of statistical theory and practice in the past century. On the other hand, the bias caused by poor/uneven data quality, data contamination, missing data, gross errors, etc. has received much less attention. Unlike sampling variability, contamination bias is difficult to model and measure and does not diminish with increasing sample sizes. For moderate and large data sets, the uncertainty due to data quality (contamination bias) usually dominates the uncertainty due to sampling variability. The current robustness theory is mainly concerned with issues of data quality and addresses, at least in part, the problem of data contamination bias. In the next few years I will continue to conduct research in the following topics (a) Robust variable selection for linear models, classification and cluster analysis (b) Estimation of contamination bias bounds for linear model estimates (c) Development of robust methods (linear regression, scatter estimates, etc.) that are robust under general contamination models (including cellwise and casewise contamination) and can be applied to very large datasets (d) Development of new models to represent data contamination in highly multivariate settings (e) adapting robust estimates to situations involving missing data (f) assessing the effect of missing data in robust estimates. The proposed research has theoretical relevance and also the potential to enhance the usefulness and applicability of robust methodology in many fields including data mining and bioinformatics.","Robust Inference","Advancement of knowledge",CANADA,CANADA,"Parametric inference"

"The rich chemistry of the transition metals has been adapted by nature such that many of these elements are essential components of vital biological reactions.  Paradoxically, the properties of metals that make them such useful cellular factors can also be harmful to cells and can produce lethal damage.  To harness the chemistry of the essential metals, organisms have developed tightly-regulated systems that specifically import metals only when required, transport them within the cell to proteins that use or store them, and export the excess.  In this manner, the cell can depend on having an adequate supply without accumulating an unprotected pool of these potentially toxic nutrients.  An understanding of metal homeostasis requires identification of the proteins involved, as well as research into the mechanisms of regulation and specific metal recognition.  This knowledge has applications in human nutrition and in the prevention and treatment of diseases related to metal homeostasis.  Other medical uses include the design of antibiotics that target the unique metal requirements of microorganisms.  Furthermore, the increasing spread of toxic heavy metals in the environment provides an incentive to engineer plants and microorganisms to be used as biosensors and in bioremediation.



This proposal describes experiments to study several nickel pathways in the pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori.  These systems include proteins that are required for functional insertion of nickel into the active site of hydrogenase enzymes, as well as a nickel-dependent transcription factor that regulates the cellular uptake and use of the metal.  Furthermore, we have isolated a small nickel-binding peptide with the potential to be used as a model for a nickel-chelating antimicrobial agent.  In our studies of nickel proteins we use a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the bioinorganic chemistry of the metal-binding complexes and the biochemical mechanisms of action.  This information will teach us about cellular metal homeostasis, a fundamental aspect of life.

"Cell-based therapeutics are motivated by the observation that many cell transplantation procedures yield significant benefits to patients. Unfortunately however, the cells and/or tissues needed to treat the numbers of patients that could benefit from cell transplantation significantly outstrip availability from donors. Stem cells have generated much excitement as a potential source of cells for drug development and cell-based therapeutics because of their ability to self-renew (divide while maintaining stem cell properties) and differentiate into functional cells (such as blood or heart cells). The proposed studies will continue our efforts to develop a mechanism-based technological platform for the generation of therapeutically relevant cells from pluripotent stem cells.  

1) Signaling network dynamics and stable pluripotent cell states - In this project we will investigate how different pluripotent stem cells (embryonic stem cells and epiblast stem cells) with an apparently similar core transcriptional network can be stabilized by two completely different signaling networks.

 2) Bioprocesses for generating, capturing and expanding pluripotent stem cell-derived blood progenitors. This project will investigate the use of engineered peptide transduction domain-transcription factor fusion proteins and episomal transgene expression strategies to induce and propagate blood stem cells from phenotypically defined pluripotent stem cell-derived cells. 

These studies use novel bioengineering strategies uncover fundamental mechanisms regulating the stabilization of pluripotent stem cell populations (Project 1), and the differentiation of these pluripotent cells into functional blood stem cells (Project 2).  The highly qualified personnel emerging from the proposed research program should have with the tools and expertise to lead next generation Canadian biotechnology activities.

"The study of animals inhabiting oceanic islands has been central to our understanding of evolution and ecology ever since Darwin because travel over water represents a barrier to the movement of most birds and mammals, resulting in the creation of unique assemblages of species with unique characteristics.  Because travel over water also represents a barrier to humans, conducting research on oceanic islands requires a boat.  It is difficult to imagine a more indispensable piece of equipment for this type of work.  We are requesting funds to replace  a now unusable inflatable boat, purchased with NSERC RTI funds in fiscal year 2002-3, with a larger, safer, rigid-hull inflatable boat, necessary to permit year-round research.  Delaying the acquisition of this equipment will jeopardize the research of five (3 MSc, 2 PhD) current graduate students and significantly impair the research program of an integrated team of five highly active investigators from four universities (U Western Ontario, U Toronto, U Victoria, Simon Fraser U) with complementary expertise in genetics, physiology, behaviour and ecology, who are addressing questions concerning predator-prey relationships, introductions and extirpations, and partial migration, in birds and mammals, on islands.  We expect to make major advances in understanding: indirect predator effects on prey demography, the genetic implications arising from islands having fewer predators, the significance of 'mesopredator release' on islands, and how island prey come to 'forget' their predators (prey naivetï¿½).  All of the research will be conducted in the B.C. Gulf Islands to take advantage of the team's long experience doing research here and the unusual logistical opportunity provided to address phenomena at a whole-archipelago scale.  Over the next 5 years we expect to supervise at least 12 MSc and 6 PhD students, and 15 undergraduate research assistants, all of whom will require the use of the requested research boat.  These students will receive extensive training in the areas of molecular-, physiological-, behavioural-, and population-, ecology; as well as conservation biology.  The resulting cadre of highly qualified personnel will thus be given the skills needed to contribute to the academic, government and private sectors.

"Predators scare more prey than they kill.  Killing prey obviously reduces their number but does scaring them do so as well?  If so, then the predator's presence may have a far greater impact on the prey population than could be guessed from the kill rate.  Minimizing the impact of introduced or invasive predators is crucial to the conservation of numerous species at risk.  Dr Zanette's objectives are to, quantify the full impact of predators on terrestrial vertebrate (bird and mammal) prey, and so aid in effective conservation planning.  Though recent work on insects and aquatic species shows that scaring prey can reduce their numbers faster than killing them does, it is not certain the same will be found in birds and mammals given their greater behavioural flexibility.  Dr Zanette has already shown that songbirds: 1) suffer chronic stress where predators are naturally more abundant; 2) can only dramatically increase their reproductive success in response to more food, where predators are less abundant; and 3) may produce far fewer daughters than sons when exposed to predators.  These and other of her discoveries have been repeatedly featured in both the international scientific, and popular, media.  Dr Zanette will now take the critical next step of experimentally removing both an introduced (raccoon) and an invasive (brown-headed cowbird) predator to quantify all of the impacts on their prey, in B.C.'s southern Gulf Islands, where she conducts her research.  Dr Zanette and her students will test the effects on the physiology, behaviour and reproductive output of adults; and the growth, development and survival of their young; in both song sparrows and deer mice.  She and her team are singularly able to address these questions using a globally-unique, digital video system she designed that allows them to catch predators in the act.  It is thanks to this system that Dr Zanette can now proceed with experimental predator removals since, like most other terrestrial vertebrate ecologists, she was previously unable to say who the principal predators were.  In addition to addressing fundamental ecological processes, Dr Zanette's research will be used in planning an introduced/invasive predator mitigation program for the new Southern Gulf Islands National Park.","Predator effects on terrestrial vertebrate prey: an integrated approach to responses at multiple scales","Conservation and preservation",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal ecology"

"During the past decade, many countries, including the provinces of Ontario and Alberta in Canada, have moved from the traditional power systems operation environment and have deregulated their power industry. Unlike the traditional power systems, deregulated electricity markets are featured with uncertain future prices. In these markets, electricity prices are competitively determined, on spot, for each specific interval during a day (e.g., for each 5-minute interval) based on the available supply and market demand. Future electricity market prices, however, are the key factors affecting most of the strategic decisions made by various market entities to optimize their operation. Examples of such decisions are operation scheduling, investment planning, and the setting up of public energy polices. Thus, optimality of such decisions is highly tied to the efficiency of price models employed to forecast future electricity market prices. 



This proposal is focused on the development of efficient algorithms and techniques, as well as the advancement of available methodologies, to analyze, model, and forecast the short-term, the medium-term, and the long-term behavior of electricity market prices.  These algorithms are critical to the optimal utilization, adequate expansion, and efficient regulation of modern power systems in a deregulated market environment. Several key factors, including the integration of bulk wind-powered generators in power systems, the expected future supply diversity and environmental constraints, change in daily electricity demand resulting from the usage of renewable energy resources, and market rules and policies will be considered when modeling future prices.



In addition, this research is concerned with the application of realistic price models in managing power and energy systems. Operation and maintenance scheduling, and transmission and generation expansion planning are the examples of such applications.

"This proposal concerns the subject of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in trapped Bose gases. At ultra-low temperatures, a gas of bosonic atoms exhibits a kind of condensation in which most of the atoms fall into the lowest available quantum state. In this novel state of matter, the atoms act coherently, and exhibit quantum behaviour on scales approaching macroscopic dimensions. The implications are far-reaching and profound. Potential applications include atomic lasers, atomic lithography and quantum computing.

     The proposed research can be broadly characterized as the theoretical study of the dynamics of these trapped gases at finite temperatures. Above absolute zero, the gas consists of a combination of the condensed phase, the condensate, and thermally excited atoms that constitute a thermal cloud. This system of atoms can undergo a variety of modes of oscillation that can be studied experimentally. The theoretical challenge is to provide a description of this behaviour that explains the observed mode frequencies and the rate at which the modes decay as a function of time.

     Much of the interest in the subject stems from the fact that trapped gases can be manipulated in various ways. For example, the gas can be made to spin rapidly by rotating the confining potential. In this way, arrays of vortices can be generated. Part of the project will address the question of how these vortices are initially formed, and how the vortices finally arrange themselves in an ordered array.

     Another way to manipulate the atoms is to simply shine light on them. If the light forms a standing wave, a periodic potential arises and the atoms effectively reside on a lattice. The theoretical tools we have at our disposal will allow us to explore the interesting dynamical behaviour of the atoms in this situation, especially at elevated temperatures when both a condensate and thermal cloud are present. The knowledge gained from such studies will extend even further our ability control atoms in these kinds of systems.

"One purpose of this research is to develop a new statistical tool to learn from collected data to find posterior model structure for inferential purposes. These models are usually built under strong but questionable set of assumptions. While little is known a non-parametric or semi-parametric method avoids these imprecise set of assumptions. The present research uses some new prior information to bulid nonparametric inferential tools that can learn from the data. These methods generate fast computational algorithms and mathematical tools.



Moreover, modelling  data when it is collected through time and when sudden bursts occur is important in many practical examples such as stock market. This study develops tools to detect abrupt changes and investigate the large sample behavior of some estimators.

"In this program of research I intend to examine a number of issues related to the efficient allocation of public sector resources.  The research covers two main problems and several variations of each: a budgeting problem, and a purchasing problem.  

  The budgeting problem is motivated by the following representative scenario: Suppose that an international aid organization wishes to allocate funds to multiple regions, but decision makers within each region will have final control over how the funds are spent.  How should funds be allocated among regions?  The purchasing problem is motivated by the following representative scenario: Suppose that a manager at a drug benefits plan is concerned about inappropriate usage of drugs listed on its formulary and is therefore considering imposing limited use conditions on all new drugs.  How are drug manufacturers likely to respond?

  The research will use methods from management science, optimization, supply chain management, and the economics of contracts.  The program will pursue theoretical advances while focusing on applications in budgeting and public sector purchasing, as well as from other areas.

"The Canadian Water and Wastewater Association (CWWA) reported that there were more than 112,000 kilometers of water mains in Canada, which required $12.5 billion over 15-year (1997-2012) period to rehabilitate the existing (deteriorated) and construct new water mains in order to cope with the projected population growth. Although there are several research works, reported in the literature, on construction and rehabilitation of municipal infrastructure systems, further investigation is needed to study the cost-effective rehabilitation method(s) for various elements of water system and to optimize the allocation of municipal resources (budget, labor, and equipment) to water system projects. The applicant, capitalizing on his previous and ongoing research works on infrastructure management systems, is planning to investigate the area of underground municipal infrastructure systems from construction and rehabilitation perspectives. The proposed research involves designing a decision support system (DSS) to achieve the following main activities: (a) auto-detect water leak from the water system and study its causes; (b) select the cost-effective rehabilitation method considering impact on environment and the total cost through the life cycle of a water main project; (c) assess the reliability of water distribution networks and evaluate the performance of water transmission mains; and (d) develop a model to optimize the allocation of municipal resources (emergency and repair crews (labor and equipment)) among emergency projects. These activities and models will be developed using Monte Carlo simulation, web geographical information system (Web-GIS), optimization, and decision making techniques. The DSS will facilitate, using the web as a platform, communication among various levels of municipal management and accelerate their decision-making process. The proposed research will contribute to the state of the art of water system rehabilitation management in both academic and industrial sectors. This research is deemed essential to the three government tiers (municipal, provincial, and federal) to meet public needs of quality of life, safety, and health.

"The existence of life on Earth depends on photosynthesis, a remarkably effective process of converting light energy into chemical energy. Unraveling the details of the primary events of photosynthesis (light harvesting, energy transfer and primary charge transfer) is necessary to fully understand the ways in which Nature achieved such a high effectiveness of energy conversion. These studies are important not only from the viewpoint of fundamental science, but could contribute to the development of novel photovoltaic devices.  Discovering better ways to harness sunlight energy will result in economical as well as various environmental benefits, e.g. reduction of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, prevention of undesired climate changes, etc. 



    We will employ various techniques of frequency-domain optical spectroscopy: absorption, fluorescence-excitation and fluorescence spectroscopies, as well as high-resolution methods - Spectral Hole Burning and Single Molecule / Complex Spectroscopy.  Experimental studies will be accompanied by computer modeling.

"My research focuses on the theory and implementation of algorithms and data structures for memory hierarchies.  Current technological developments lead to a rapidly widening gap between processor speeds and memory (RAM) transfer rates.  This gap is even more significant if disk access times are taken into account.  Hence, today's processors are useless unless there is a way to bridge the gap between processor and memory speeds.  The approach to this problem taken in state-of-the-art computers is the use of a hierarchy of several levels of fast, but relatively small, cache memory.  This approach is useful only if the programs that are run have sufficiently local memory access patterns that ensure that most memory accesses can be served from cache rather than from main memory or disk.  Achieving this locality is challenging for many computational problems.  This is the focus of my research.  My research programme has a theoretical and a more applied facet.  The theoretical work aims at developing general techniques for designing algorithms and data structures with high access locality.  The applied work will apply these techniques and evaluate their usefulness in particular problem settings through implementation and experimentation.  The particular problems I focus on are:

(1)  Graph problems.  This is motivated by applications that have to process massive graphs efficiently, such as web mining and web modelling, geographic information systems, and information retrieval.

(2)  Data structures and algorithms for fundamental geometric search problems, most notably range search problems.  The motivation is the need to answer such search problems efficiently in database applications and geographic information systems.

"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a DNA virus that infects coating tissues of the body such as skin. More than 200 types have been identified and a subset of these HPVs can ""transform"" healthy tissue from a benign to a malignant state. This occurs only in approximately one of a hundred infected individuals and is related to the ability of HPV to persist in the host. In particular one HPV of the transforming types is more prone to persist than other types, which may be caused by ""variants"" in its DNA genome. This HPV is also most prevalent worldwide. By analyzing the activities of variants of this specific type during the viral life cycle we will comprehend the role viral variants play in persistence. This proposal addresses a basic, central theme of virus biology. The concept that viral variants drive evolution by impacting on viral drift and shift to ensure viral progeny has not been tested previously and will potentially lead to new discoveries.","Molecular variants of human papillomavirus: impact on viral life cycle and persistence","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,Microbiology

"The goals of this research program are to advance our knowledge of the paleobiology of dinosaurs through the study of their eggs, eggshells, clutches, nests, and nest environments. Hypotheses related to reproduction in dinosaurs will be tested, including those concerned with shell and egg formation, nesting, nature of egg incubation, growth strategy of babies, and appearance of bird-like reproductive traits among dinosaurs. Fossils for this research program will be collected in Alberta through fieldwork in Cretaceous-aged rocks. Detailed analyses of fossilized eggs and nests of dinosaurs, with comparative analysis of these features in living birds and crocodiles (because these animals are the closest living relatives of extinct dinosaurs), will be conducted in laboratories using microscopes, CT-scanners, and computers.

      The proposed research program is unique in that nest sites and associated fossils will be studied in order to shed light on the reproductive biology of dinosaurs, an aspect of their biology that cannot be revealed through the study of skeletal remains alone. Significantly, this research will greatly enhance our understanding of reproduction and development in extinct dinosaurs, and will resolve the patterns of evolution of such traits among archosaurs (dinosaurs, birds, and crocodiles) in the long-term, further illuminating the relationships between extinct dinosaurs and living animals. 

     This research program is important to Canada because the collection of fossils from Alberta will preserve a significant part of Canada's natural history for future generations. It is anticipated that the results and discoveries of this research will be relayed to the public through museum exhibits, television, newspapers, books, and magazines.

"The metabolic acidosis that occurs in diarrhea, as well as in other diseases, is a significant cause of illness and death, especially in young animals and children. Metabolic acidosis is a cause for concern because when blood pH decreases below the range at which the body functions best various problems including death can result. Another complication of diarrhea is dehydration which can make the acidosis in blood worse.  The development of acidosis in diarrhea is not well understood.  In diarrheic calves, we have recently shown that an acid, D-lactate, is present in the blood at high levels.  We have also shown that this acid alone is responsible for some of the symptoms present in acidosis, especially brain disturbances including inappropriate behaviour and confusion. This acid is produced only by bacteria in the gut.  In diarrheic calves, injury to the gut results in D-lactate passing into the blood causing the harmful acidosis.  We believe a similar mechanism occurs in many other species, including humans.   Our objectives for this grant cycle are: A) To determine the presence of D-lactate and D-lactic acidosis, in species other than the calf, in both healthy and diseased conditions, B) to determine whether additional compounds contribute to the acidosis present in severe diarrhea, C) to determine the effect of acidosis, as well as D-lactate, on brain and kidney function, D) to determine if D-lactate inhibits L-lactate uptake into brain cells and its metabolism in the brain, E) to valuate the current therapies used in reversing acidosis, and F) to treat D-lactic acidosis by feeding bacteria (probiotics) that do not produce D-lactate or compounds (prebiotics) which help in decreasing the production of D-lactate, as alternatives to antibiotic therapy.  This research will help further our understanding of metabolic acidosis, especially D-lactic acidosis, in diarrhea, which is both a cause of great economic loss in the agricultural industry in Canada and a disease that afflicts many children worldwide.

"Machine learning research aims to build computer systems that extract useful information from data.

Considerable progress has been made in the two main areas of learning.  Supervised methods, which rely

on having target labels for each input, have proved to be very powerful and widely applicable,

particularly on classification problems, in which each input example is assigned to one of a small set

of classes.  These methods generally scale poorly with the number of training examples and classes.

Unsupervised methods utilize unlabeled data, where no targets are provided, and attempt to construct

representations useful for many input-output mappings.  These methods scale readily but are not as

powerful, because without labels considerable structure must be imposed to make the algorithms work.



This proposal focuses on the development of learning methods that utilize both labeled and unlabeled

examples, addressing two fundamental problems.  The first is scene analysis, which entails picking out

multiple items in visual input.  For example, a video of a busy street recorded digitally as a stream of

color pixel-maps may be re-represented in terms of the cars and pedestrians and their motions. This is

an essential and difficult problem, involving a combination of low-level image properties with

high-level, object-specific knowledge.  The second problem is {\it rapid learning}.  The human ability

to acquire a visual concept from a few examples, and to recognize instances in a complex scene, poses a

central challenge to the fields of computer vision, cognitive science, and machine learning.  Improving

machines' ability to acquire new concepts readily has applications not only to vision, enabling analysis

of scenes containing relatively novel objects, but also to the domain of online interaction, as rapid

learning system can build an accurate model of a user with just a few questions, or limited knowledge of

the person's web-surfing history or product preferences.

"A new kind of high-resolution biomedical imaging technology will be developed that combines ultrasound and lasers. Pulses of laser light sent into tissue generate inaudible sound waves when the light is absorbed by small blood vessels. These signals are used to form images of the optical properties of the tissue. This technique is called photoacoustic imaging. Just as arteries & veins have different oxygen-dependent colors, photoacoustic imaging is sensitive to color & thus blood oxygenation. We will combine this imaging technique, termed functional photoacoustic microscopy, with Doppler ultrasound which can measure blood flow. The goal in doing this is to measure the rate at which oxygen is consumed in local tissues. This will be important for a large number of biomedical problems, since oxygen metabolism relates to tissue function and dysfunction. Oxygen usage is altered in many diseases such as cancer, stroke, and heart disease. The imaging technique is completely non-invasive, requires no special contrast agents & may  be inexpensive enough and portable enough to be used in many settings including research laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, and medical clinics. It may help doctors detect and treat diseases, and may provide us with a better understanding of disease progression. To realize this vision, our research team will build a system that can perform both photoacoustic and Doppler ultrasound imaging. We will use this system to provide new informaton about the optical properties of tissues, and test the ability of the system to measure oxygen consumption in controlled phantom experiments.

"Thin net pay heavy oil reservoirs are less attractive for SAGD because of the reduced economics and increased environmental footprints. VAPEX, similar to SAGD, but using solvent to reduce the oil viscosity, has been proposed to produce thin net pay heavy oil reservoirs in an environmentally sustainable way. 

   This study will integrate 1-D, 2-D and 3-D physical and mathematical modeling studies to intensively present and model the mechanisms of solvent injection in heavy oil reservoirs, to optimize solvent injection processes, and eventually to enhance the oil production efficiency. Experimental study will be conducted to measure the three main mechanisms involved in solvent injection processes: molecular diffusion/dispersion, viscosity fingering and non-equilibrium phase behavior. A novel semi-analytical approach developed by the applicant will be applied to improve the mathematical modeling in order to more accurately predict the performance of solvent injection in heavy oil reservoirs and reduce the uncertainty of heavy oil reservoir development plan. With the improved simulation and 3-D physical modeling studies, the following technologies will be developed and validated to improve the efficiency of solvent injection process in thin net pay heavy oil reservoirs: (1) Approaches, e.g. electrical heating, to improve horizontal well conformance; (2) Optimized well pattern, e.g. Tee-well pattern or multi-lateral wellbores, and optimized solvent injection strategy; (3) solvent trapping technologies to reduce solvent oil ratio. The upscaling approaches will also be developed to scale up the laboratory results to field scale. 

   This work is an important step to achieve our long-term objective, which is to develop ""green"" technologies for the next generations as well as train them on how to generate knowledge and be creative. To meet the objective, a reservoir physical and mathematical modeling group will be established. This group will have the capacity to train six undergraduate students, six master students and three PhD students simultaneously. This will help Canada remain the leadership in sustainable energy technology development and education.

"Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA) is a research instrument for directly measuring the static and dynamic forces between surfaces, and for studying interfacial and thin film phenomena at the molecular level. The Surface Forces Apparatus 3 (SFA 3) requested in this proposal is the extremely stable and versatile apparatus among the SFA family. Useful for both basic and applied studies, the SFA 3 is an extremely sensitive instrument, and it measures the forces between two surfaces in vapors or liquids with a sensitivity of 10 nN and a distance resolution of 1ï¿½ measured in situ. It can also be used to measure surface deformations arising from surface forces, dynamic interactions such as viscoelastic and frictional forces, and other time-dependent phenomena in real time, etc.



The Surface Forces Apparatus 3 (SFA 3) requested will be used by graduate students and researchers to conduct pioneering research to resolve a wide range of long-unresolved problems in many fields. These include intersurface forces and interaction dyanmics of viscoelastic/viscous polymer thin films in vapors and liquids, hydrophobic interactions in oil emulsions and colloids, specific ligand-receptor interactions in bioengineering for biodiagnostic devices and for drug and gene delivery applications, as well as interfacial effects and interactions in multiphase fluid systems. The award of this request for an SFA 3, coupled with our existing single molecular force spectroscopy and attenuated total internal reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, will enable us to conduct pioneering research on intermolecular and surface interactions of many soft materials and complex fluid systems. The success of the projects outlined in this proposal will have a significant socio-economical impact on Canadian chemical and mining industry and bioengineering, and place us among the world's best facilities in colloidal and interfacial sciences.","Surface Forces Apparatus 3 (SFA 3)","Materials sciences",CANADA,CANADA,"Thin films/interface"
"Longitudinal studies are increasingly common in many areas of research with the defining characteristic of repeated measurements from each individual over a period of time. Frequently, more complex types of correlation structure arise in the longitudinal studies when multivariate or clustered longitudinal data are involved. Examples include medical studies where a vector of health indicator variables are collected longitudinally and community or school based intervention studies.



This proposal develops methods for the analysis of correlated data arising from longitudinal studies. One challenge is to address the complex association structure from the mutlivariate/clustered longitudinal data. The methods developed are based on mixed transitional models, where the intra-cluster and cross-sectional correlations are incorporated by random effects and serial longitudinal correlation is incorporated by a transition (Markov) model.  Design criteria are developed based on random effect formulations. Another challenge arises when the spatial clustering is evident both in the placement of the population mixtures and their evolution over time. The motivating example is a study of recurrent weevil infection in white pine in British Columbia. Methods for spatial analysis which can simultaneously provide inference for transition rates and handle the excess zeros in the data are developed. Often, data collected from studies include not only repeated measurements of one or more longitudinal processes, but also include information for an event time of interest. This proposal also considers methods for the joint analysis of correlated longitudinal processes and survival data, with focus on the complicate situations where there are spatial correlations and event times are interval censored. The above projects find substantive applications in arthritis studies of joint damage, in ophthalmology studies of progression of eye vision condition and, in forestry studies of pine beetle attacks and relationship between growth and mortality of trees.

"Plant and algae use sunlight and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to feed themselves and, indirectly, all other organisms in the food chain.  They do this through photosynthesis, a process that occurs in specialized compartments within their cells called chloroplasts. The research proposed in this application will explore specific aspects of the internal organization of chloroplasts and how chloroplasts are assembled. One question concerns where the assembly occurs of the machinery that carryout the light-utilizing reactions of photosynthesis.  Another question concerns how the chloroplast manages information-carrying molecules called messenger RNAs. We will explore specialized compartments in chloroplasts that closely resemble compartments in the cells of animals, including humans. The third question relates to how chloroplasts stimulate the synthesis of certain proteins in response to light. Chloroplasts make proteins with a molecular machine called the ribosome. We will explore the possibility that ribosomes are activated in response to light by the incorporation of a specific essential ribosome component, which in turn is removed in the dark, to inactivate them. To study these questions, we use a relatively simple model organism that is easy to grow and manipulate in the laboratory: the single-celled algae, Chlamydomonas. What we learn about the chloroplast of these algae cells, will probably help researchers develop more productive and stress resistant agricultural plants. The surprising similarities between chloroplasts and human cells are related to how cells cope with stress and regulate their genes. The chloroplast of Chlamydomonas is also a remarkably productive factory. It can produce hydrogen gas using photosynthesis. This is being explored as an alternative energy source.  The chloroplast in Chlamydomonas cells can also efficiently produce vaccines, drugs, and other useful molecules, both safely and cheaply. These algae cells are telling us some important things about how all cells work and stimulating biotechnological developments in Canada.

"Much of the existing research on consumer behavior modeling in RM is on consumer choice behavior, where consumers are assumed to choose among the products offered. Only in the last few years have richer consumer behavior models been considered in RM. The research is motivated largely by the increasing interests to understand consumer behavior in RM applications. Indeed, consumer behavior is one of the most widely discussed issues among practitioners. Issues such as consumer upgrading, downgrading, recapturing, and cancellation have long been recognized, and methods dealing with such aspects are integral parts of the existing RM systems. Other consumer behaviors, however, are rarely considered in RM implementations. 

Consumer behavior modeling in RM leads to great theoretical challenges as well as significant practical potential. Given the popularity of product-based RM systems, it is important to understand the performance of RM systems with model misspecifications caused by incorrect assumptions on consumer behavior. Eventually, our goal is to propose a framework to understand and evaluate the performance of various RM strategies in the presence of consumer behavior.  We plan to achieve our research objectives by building a framework of dynamic models of seller-buyer interactions to investigate the impact of consumer behavior. In the dynamic framework, each seller implements an RM process while each buyer acts according to certain behavioral models. We are interested in studying the dynamic system that consists of the sellers and the buyers. Our focus is to understand the system dynamics over time to evaluate the performance of various RM strategies. While it may be unrealistic to incorporate many different behavioral consumer models in a practical RM implementation, it is still very important to understand the effects of different consumer behaviors. Conceivably, such knowledge will be helpful in guiding us in practical RM system design and implementation.

We will develop integrated decision-making models for enhancing the performance of the supply network, and propose novel algorithms to solve the complex problems. The models and solution approaches to be developed will support strategic, tactical, and operational decisions related to the design of supply chain networks.

"As frustrations start to set in when one struggles to solve a problem, it is often natural to attempt to look at the problem from another angle. Indeed, by transforming a given problem from the space in which it is defined into an alternative domain, one may be able to gain an insight more easily or reveal simpler patterns or structures that have been obscured by the problem's complexity in the original domain. Many such examples can be found in various computer science and engineering disciplines, e.g., transform coding for image compression, eigenfaces for face recognition, geometric duality in computational geometry, Hough transforms in image processing, and kernel-based methods in machine learning and pattern recognition. 



With the rapid advances in 3D scanning and acquisition technology, discrete shape representations, such as triangle meshes, are playing a dominant role in computer graphics, allowing for realistic and high-precision modeling of 3D geometry. Mesh models are ubiquitous in applications ranging from computer aided design (e.g., in automobile and aerospace engineering), data visualization (e.g., in archeology and GIS), to medicine and computer games. In the proposed research, we wish to investigate transform-based approaches for solving practical mesh processing and analysis problems in computer graphics. The main focus will be on spectral methods, which utilize selected eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and/or eigenprojections of appropriately defined linear operators to carry out desired tasks,  such as mesh segmentation, mesh layout, shape correspondence, and object recognition. We also propose to study 3D Hough transforms, parallel coordinates, Gaussian images, among others, and to find innovative ways to apply them to classical or new geometric problems in computer graphics, including visibility, shape inference from point cloud data, and manifold Delaunay triangulation. From our past experiences, we believe that these special transforms can bring new insights into our understanding of the problems at hand and contribute substantially to advancing the state of the art.

"The mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials is controlled by the dynamical behavior of, and interactions among the microstructural elements (such as dislocations, grain boundaries, voids, and precipitates) under the applied stress. It is well known that dislocation pile-ups at grain boundaries can explain the experimentally observed dependence of the yield strength on grain size. However, when grain sizes are decreased to the nano-scale, such mechanisms are inoperative. At these small scales, it is rare to find any dislocations within a grain. Rather, plastic deformation is controlled by the nucleation and absorption of dislocations at grain boundaries. Therefore, deformation mechanisms that are unimportant at large length scales begin to play increasingly important roles. These include twinning, grain boundary sliding, rotation, migration, and phase transformations. The goal of this proposed research is to identify the atomistic mechanisms by which nanocrystalline materials deform. In particular, we will examine the individual mechanisms and then determine how they interact to accommodate one another. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods will be our main tool for exploring the atomistic mechanisms of nanocrystal deformation. In our early study of grain boundary migration, we have developed a set of very robust, effective statistical measures for identifying the atomistic mechanisms for grain boundary migration. These methods have proven to be powerful tools in studies of other complex dynamical processes as well. We will apply these to characterize the atomic motion that governs the key deformation events (e.g. boundary sliding, twinning, dislocation nucleation, and phase transformations.) With the atomistic deformation mechanisms in hand, we will propose new approaches to the design of ultra-strong, ultra-tough materials for specific materials applications.

"Bayesian networks (BNs) have been widely used in data mining applications, in which learning a BN from data is crucial. Most BN learning algorithms learn a joint distribution over all the variables to best fit the training data, i.e. generative learning. Discriminative learning directly targets a task-specific model, instead of a generative model, and demonstrates superior performance. Discriminatively learning a BN includes two steps: structure learning and parameter learning. Structure learning determines the structure of a BN, and parameter learning sets the local distribution for each variable. 

The objective of this research is to investigate the discriminative learning of BNs for various data mining tasks: classification, ranking, and probability estimation. In this research, we will investigate the following issues. (1) Effective discriminative BN learning: We are going to study discriminative structure learning that can effectively discover the underlying structure, and discriminative parameter learning that can compute the optimal parameters efficiently. (2) Scalable discriminative BN learning: One objective of this research is to develop efficient discriminative BN learning algorithms scalable to large-scale data mining. We are going to study various scaling up methods for  both structure learning and parameter learning. (3) Discriminative BN learning for ranking and probability estimation: In some data mining applications, accurate rankings and probability estimates are often desired. Is discriminative learning superior in terms of yielding accurate rankings and probabilities? How can BNs be discriminatively trained for this purpose? What kind of scoring functions and search strategies should be used? Our research will answer these questions. 

Due to the inherent features of discriminative learning, we would expect that this research could result in more effective and efficient data mining algorithms.

"The capability to recognize and localize sounds of interest in the presence of background noise is important for the behavioral needs of mammals. This capability is dependent on the central auditory system which consists of several neural structures with the auditory cortex being at the highest level. The auditory cortex receives ascending neural projections from subcortical auditory structures and provides descending projections to these structures, indicating that this cortical structure contributes to hearing not only by processing neural signals that it receives but also by controlling subcortical neural responses.



I propose that the ability to recognize and localize sounds of interest (e.g., novel sounds) and to ignore background noises is related to descending projections from the auditory cortex. Specifically, there are descending projections serving to gate auditory signals in subcortical auditory structures, so that only information related to sounds of interest can be conveyed from low to high structures for further processing. My laboratory will conduct neurophysiological, neuropharmacological, and neuroanatomical experiments to test this hypothesis regarding the gating function of the descending projections from the auditory cortex. We will also examine how this gating function is dependent on the neurotransmitter receptors that mediate the descending projections. Our research will provide knowledge about the neural mechanisms responsible for sound recognition and localization. The research will also provide implications regarding how selective attention to sounds is created. Furthermore, the research will help us determine whether the auditory cortex shares neural mechanisms with other sensory cortices in the control of subcortical sensory processing.","Physiological functions and neural mechanisms of descending projections from the auditory cortex","Life sciences (including biotechnology)",CANADA,CANADA,"Sensory systems -- auditory"

"The recent arrival of the Information Age has created an explosive demand for knowledge and information exchange in our society. This demand has triggered off an enormous expansion in wireless communications in which severe technical challenges, including the need of transmitting speech, data and video at high rates in an environment rich of scattering, have been encountered. A recent development in wireless communication systems is the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wireless link which, due to its potential in meeting these challenges caused by fading channels together with power and bandwidth limitations, has become a very important area of research. The importance of MIMO communications lies in the fact that they are able to provide a significant increase in capacity over a single antenna system. To take advantage of the MIMO communication channel and combat fading and cross-talk, a space-time block code (STBC) has been developed by spacing the transmitter antennas sufficiently and introducing a code for the transmitted symbols distributed over transmitter antennas (space) and symbol periods (time). The research program presented in this proposal is to develop a first-rate research and training environment for the MIMO wireless communication systems. The proposal aims at establishing a novel theory and solving the following three open and challenging problems: (1) The design of an optimal STBC for the MIMO systems with the optimal coherent receiver (i.e., the channel knowledge is available at the receiver); (2) The design of an optimal STBC for multi-input single-output systems with simple coherent receivers. Such a design is often useful in mobile downlink communications; (3) The systematic design of a STBC for the unique identification of the MIMO fading channels when channel information is completely unavailable. The proposed research program will create an essential research and training environment appropriate to impart requisite skills to highly qualified personnel (HQP) who will fulfill the needs of Canadian academia and wireless communication industries. The program will attract talented and experienced researchers and HQP in the world and retain them in Canada.

"We propose to study polygon search problems in computational geometry and robotics. 



Computational geometry is the study of algorithms to solve problems related to geometry. In many applications of the discipline, visibility problems play a fundamental role. In essence, given a polygon, if the line segment connecting two given points is within the polygon, we say that the two points are mutually visible. Despite its simple definition, there are many intriguing problems related to it. Motion planning in robotics is one of the applications related to visibility problems. Basically, it asks how to plan the movement of robots in a given area such that any intruders inside the area will be detected. 



Our work studies motion planning for robots at an abstract level. It was coined as the polygon search problem, in which the given area is delineated as a simple polygon and the robots (also called searchers or guards) and intruders are represented as mobile points. Our research centers around three directions of the polygon search problem. 



(1) Characterization of searchable polygons, in terms of the geometric patterns, under different settings of searchers, such as a 1-searcher, who is equipped with one flashlight; (2) Generation of a search schedule that the searcher(s) can follow to search a polygon, once the polygon is determined to be searchable; (3) On-line search in a polygon with unknown geometric properties, such as its edges and vertices. 



Our study will improve our understanding of polygon search problems, provide further improvements to the current results, and solve new proposed problems.

"Microfluidics, by name, studies the behaviors of fluids of very small volumes. Applications of microfluidics can be found in biotech lab-on-a-chips for biochemical analysis, fuel cells for clean and efficient energy, and micro heat exchangers for electronics. Recently, liquid droplets, which can function as the smallest reactors in chemical and biochemical reactions, are considered as the next generation microfluidic technology, or the so-called digital microfluidics. In such systems for biological and biochemical analysis, interfacial tension and surface wettability are usually employed for flow metering, activation, and control. Due to the high surface-area-to-volume ratio, microscopic solid-fluid interactions and related interfacial phenomena have to be considered carefully in digital microfluidics. However, quantitative information is still inadequate and hence continues to hinder relevant engineering applications. 



The proposed program aims to advance our knowledge in the relationship between surface properties and droplet behaviors through computational investigations. In this program, we will develop a computational framework to simulate multiphase flows (droplets, bubbles, free surface flows, etc.) with various surface effects considered. The lattice Boltzmann method, a new simulation technology developed from statistical physics, will be employed for its flexibility in dealing with multiphase fluids and for its capability to incorporate microscopic interactions. Meanwhile, different activation and control technologies in digital microfluidics, including centrifugal pumping, electrowetting and thermocapillary, will be investigated to explore precise control and manipulation of droplet behaviors.

"Bioinformatics constitutes an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of Biology, Computer Science and Mathematics. It combines aspects from all three fields to gather, sort and analyze large masses of biological data in a meaningful way. The proposed research addresses several computational issues in this field.



My early research in this area mainly focused on the RNA structure comparison and alignment. We have made steady progress and have developed some of the best methods for RNA structure comparison and alignment. Our software, rna\_align which is on line, is one of the best for RNA structural alignment. My more recent research extends these work by considering RNA structure search in genomes, RNA structural folding, and RNA-RNA interaction and antisense RNA target search. I have also worked on computational problems related to protein identification using mass spectrometry data. PEAKS, the most accurate software for peptide {\em de novo} sequencing, is based on our algorithms and it has been used by hundreds of biotech companies and research institutions worldwide. We also studied the problem of protein identification using sequence tag from  de novo sequencing for database search and the problem of glycan structure sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry.



Based on our previous research, our research work under this proposal will focus on developing algorithms and building practical software tools for problems in RNA structure analysis and in protein identification and quantitation with mass spectrometry data including the following: RNA structure inference, RNA gene searching, common RNA secondary structure prediction, miRNA detection, peptide  de novo sequencing with one spectrum of more than one peptides or one peptide with two or more spectra, protein quantitation with or without tags, and mass spectrum data compression.

"Analog/RF circuits have been recognized as the design bottleneck for getting System-on-Chip products to market due to the high sensitivity to the associated analog/RF effects and the limited availability of analog/RF computer-aided design (CAD) tools. In particular, so far most of analog/RF layouts have to be handcrafted by circuit designers. Thus, the layout-related constraints are hard to be satisfied and included in the circuit synthesis. In this proposal, the development of design methodology and CAD tools for robust circuit/layout synthesis of analog/RF integrated circuits in deep-submicron and nano technologies is proposed. This work will focus on setting up complete circuit synthesis flow, investigating performance-driven automatic layout generation, fully taking into account distinct manufacturability issues in the advanced technologies, and exploring layout automation aided by circuit tuning. This will be the first fully automated manufacturability- aware performance-driven layout-centric synthesis methodology for analog/RF integrated circuits. In the circuit synthesis flow, the layout automation is integrated. Circuit tuning takes into account the layout-related effects so that circuit topology and sizing can be refined. The proposed complete layout design flow is composed of automatic template generation and template-based compaction. We will develop a new template-based scheme based on the macro-cell layout approach to facilitate the intellectual property reuse. Thus, the generated layout is reliable in the sense of performance and manufacturability without compromising the design efficiency.

        Having attracted strong interest in academia and industry, the circuit/layout design automation of analog/RF integrated circuits has enormous potential for commercialization. This proposed research work addresses the increasingly serious performance and manufacturability problems for analog/RF integrated circuits in deep-submicron and nano technologies. It will benefit analog/RF designers by significantly improving the design efficiency and reliability. This research program would enhance the competitive ability of Canada in this field.

"Market segmentation is a key strategic element in the practice of revenue management (RM). After being identified, market segments should be kept separate to prevent demand spillover from high priced segments to low priced segments and the associated revenue loss.  Tools to restrict customer migration across segments are referred to as ""fences"".  However, most fences are not perfect and allow some degree of demand leakage from the high-priced market segment to the low-priced segments. We propose that in the practice of RM, the firm aims at maximizing the gain generated from multiple markets, which would imply balancing the demand leakage among markets to against the cost associated with maintaining fences.  Consequently, realization of the maximum gain from segmenting markets is based upon an understanding of the optimal cost to devote to fencing, or the implementation of ""optimal fences.""

        The long term goal of this study is to understand the strategic issue of determining optimal fences. The complexity of the problem lies in the simultaneous determination of selling price, stocking quantity and fencing decision for each market segment. However, the research in fencing has significant strategic implications in many industries as a result of advances in RM that allow firms to adjust their price and ordering quantities dynamically. This appears to be a research area of unusual promise where not much work has been done, but where there is the potential to change both the practice of management and the research agenda of management science/operation research. My study has shed light on the various problems that arise in managing fences in line with other RM decisions and provided an unusually rich source of future research. Some immediate research topics include: a) Empirical experiment to estimate the cost function of fences; b) The revenue effect caused by fences; c) The impact of buy-up behavior. d) Effect of competition; e) The problem of computing an optimal fencing strategy for multiple periods or networks.","Fencing in a revenue management context","Production and operations management",CANADA,CANADA,"Operations research and management science"
"Longitudinal data is  the foundation of modern biomedical research. The past 25 years have seen tremendous development in statistical methods for the analysis of longitudinal data. In spite of much progress, there is still need for further research in order to provide methodology for analyzing different kinds of longitudinal data,  and to provide different analysis perspectives.



My research is about the development of new statistical tools suitable for the analysis of longitudinal and clustered data that arise from applied fields, such as medical, public health and environmental research. I will focus on research  related to properly modeling within subject correlation using the random mean models that I proposed in my PhD thesis. The usefulness of these ideas was shown, for example, in using the robust random mean model to deal with outlying observations, and in the application of a new non-linear regression random mean model for longitudinal data.



I will use the random mean models to develop a procedure of selecting an optimal within subject correlation structure determined by the data. Another application of random mean models is in spatial data analysis. It is difficult to model  spatio-temporal processes because of the correlation involving both space and time. Random mean models,  with correlation flexibly specified and random time effects,  may provide a good solution to this modeling problem. Clustering longitudinal data based on random mean models is also an interesting topic of my research. It will provide a practical tool for subject-area researchers in genetics and environmental studies.

"The proposed research falls into the rapidly growing area of nanoscience and nanotechnology and centers around the studies of metal nanoparticles (NPs), the fundamental building blocks of nanotechnology. The past two decades have witnessed a explosive growth of research in metal nanoparticles (NPs), which show promising applications in a variety of areas in nanotechnology such as biosensing, nanoelectronics, drug delivery and catalysis. In order to improve the performance of metal NPs in practical applications, selection of bimetallic and trimetallic NPs with well-tailored atomic structures, such as core-shell, alloy and core-alloyed shell, is often preferred. These multicomponent NPs may combine many desired functionalities associated with each component in the NPs, such as high catalytic reactivity, magnetic anisotropy, biocompatability and so on.  In spite of these advantages, it remains an important challenge to synthesize and characterize multicomponent metal NPs with well-tailored atomic structure and electronic properties. Towards this end, the proposed research is intended to improve the ability of precise control of the structure and electronic properties of multi-component metal NPs at atomic level by developing efficient synthetic methodology for the NPs and by providing insights into their structure-property relationship with powerful X-ray spectroscopy techniques. Particular emphasis will be placed in the studies of superparamagnetic NPs  containing at least one magnetic metal (e.g. Fe, Co, Ni). These fundamental studies will be carried out in conjunction with the exploration of some innovative applications of the NPs in catalysis and biotechnology.

"The quest for higher data rates and wider bandwidths in communication systems pushes operational frequencies into the radio frequency and microwave/millimeter-wave range. Here, due to electromagnetic effects, the component and system design process remains computationally challenging, even prohibitive. Recent breakthroughs in integrating available knowledge with detailed electromagnetic simulations, however, suggest ways of overcoming the electromagnetic obstacles of the next generation of design problems. The proposed research addresses the scale and critical mass necessary for the emerging technology of knowledge-based modeling and design of radio frequency, microwave and millimeter-wave components and giga-bit communication circuits. New automated algorithms will exploit modeling and design knowledge such as empirical models, equivalent circuits, semi-analytical equations, and internal electromagnetic structural information. The algorithms will embody optimized parametric and structural mappings between available knowledge and full-wave electromagnetic simulations, thereby achieving both fast and accurate design solutions. The technology will be further generalized towards multi-disciplinary design needs such as electrical/electromagnetic/ thermal/EMC design. Our comprehensive technology will serve as the engine for modeling and design optimization of the next generation high-frequency components and subsystems to help dramatically increase productivity of wireless and wireline communications systems design.  Our research will elevate the state of the art in engineering modeling and optimization. By addressing high-frequency challenges, it will contribute to extending bandwidth limits and accelerating the application of new and emerging devices for communication systems.

"The objective of this research is to develop new methodologies for modeling/optimization of high-frequency electronic components and packages in wireless and wireline communication systems. At high signal frequency, modeling and optimization of the electromagnetic behavior in devices /systems are vital. This task becomes computationally prohibitive as the complexity of the electromagnetic structure increase and optimization is applied.  For yield-driven design with random variations in physical/geometrical parameters in the system, the computational difficulty is further compounded.



The proposed research will address these challenges.  Built on top of our advances in neural network technologies for microwave design, this research will open several new frontiers in the area: a new category of training algorithms using both electromagnetic response and electromagnetic sensitivity, a new category of behavioral modeling of nonlinear devices using state-space estimation and state-space training of dynamic neural models, fundamentally new formulations of neural based parametric electromagnetic modeling exploiting spatial relationship of components.  The work will be further elevated by neural based multidisciplinary electrical/electromagnetic/thermal modeling and design. The long term direction is towards a unified methodology for developing neural based models that are fast and accurate for design of next generation high-frequency components and systems.  



The long-term impact will be faster design cycle, lower design cost, and better design quality. It contributes to creating new knowledge and training of highly qualified technical personnel in areas of high-frequency electronic design. Applications in designing RF/microwave/millimeterwave circuits, and high-speed circuits and packages also contribute to strengthening the competitiveness our high-tech economy.

"The goal of the proposed research is to develop a model-based methodology for a highly reliable and resilient

service provider system. Recently, resilience engineering is emerging to be a new paradigm for safety

management. Broadly speaking, resiliency is the ability of a system to prevent or adapt to changing conditions

in order to maintain system safety. To ground this research, telecommunication and water supply systems are

taken as examples. Specific objectives of this research include: (1) Develop a general conceptual object model

for a networked service system: The model captures the service demand, supply, operation constraint, and

structure, behaviour, principle, and social and human environments; (2) Develop a dynamic model for the

networked service system: The model captures complex demand and supply flows of a networked service

system with respect to time and space; (3) Develop a general methodology for predicting failures of a

networked service provider system, in particular those related to the network connection and cascading effect;

and (4) Develop a general methodology for designing and planning a networked service system to prevent

predicted failures and thus enhancing the system resilience. In designing and planning, both the demand and

supply entities are considered. That is to say, a design decision could simply be made on reconfiguring the

demand along with reconfiguring the structure of the system and reallocating supply resources.

This research, if successfully, will advance our understanding of system resiliency in the discipline of safety

management and generate new knowledge in the discipline of engineering design and operations management.

Safety is extremely important to Canada. Our national security policy says that there can be no greater role for a

nation than to protect its citizens. The outcome of this research will greatly enhance the safety of Canada by

mitigating and preventing failures in networked service systems - particularly critical infrastructure systems.

"Intelligent machine systems refer to machines that can exhibit the behaviors found in humans, such as learning, reasoning, decision-making, sensing, and adaptation. The contemporary intelligent machine system has nearly excluded emotion, which thus greatly compromises the degree of intelligence within the system, because the emotion is a kind of human behavior that affects the capability of information processing, decision making, and memory. This research program aims to develop a better understanding of what and how emotion affects our decision making process. The research will be conducted in two typical application domains (i.e., driver-vehicle and elderly-robot systems) in order to demonstrate the generality of the proposed research; they are chosen due to their broad impact to our society. 

There are two general questions to be answered through this research program. The first question is what would be some significant effects on human behavior change when the machine exhibits its emotion which is further caused by its physical and chemical states. The second question is how the machine and human can co-control a human-machine system to further improve its overall performance, while at the same time achieving high usability with the human. The proposed research will generate new knowledge to answer these questions. Specifically, we will first develop a methodology to construct the emotional expression of a machine to be similar as that of a human, and examine the effects of this expression on human behavior change. Second, we will develop models for a machine's emotion, human's emotion and mental workload, and the human's task performance during human-machine interaction. Last, we will develop methodologies for the machine to intelligently assist the human in controlling the overall human-machine system; assistances include making humans more understanding of what happens in the machine, generating advisory messages, and taking actions when needed. Intellectually, this research will further advance our knowledge of building intelligent systems. This research will generate social benefits in helping humans be more healthy and safer.

"The widespread distribution of the enzyme PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) in various brain regions suggests PTEN is important, but the exact roles PTEN plays in various brain functions are largely unknown. PTEN in cultured cells interacts with the membrane-associated guanylate-kinase inverted 2 (MAGI-2), a protein located in the synapses that connect two brain cells together. MAGI-2 also interacts with various molecules important for brain function. According to various lines of indirect evidence and our preliminary results, we hypothesize that PTEN regulates the function of two brain areas (i.e., the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) through its direct protein-protein interaction (coupling) with MAGI-2. We will employ various methods and techniques to critically test this hypothesis in rats. This research is novel as it will answer the entirely unknown questions of whether and how PTEN regulates various brain functions via its protein-protein interaction with MAGI-2. These studies are important for two reasons: (1) while billions of neurons in the mammalian brain communicate with each other via specialized junctions (synapses), these studies will determine the importance of PTEN and MAGI-2 in regulating synaptic function; and (2) knowledge gained from these studies will provide data for a better understanding of prefrontal- and hippocampus-dependent functions, such as learning and memory.

"Terahertz radiation, in the range of 100 GHz to 30 THz, has been investigated for astronomy and analytical science. Recent advancements in photonics and nanotechnology are now enabling innovative research of new THz generation technologies. One technique for terahertz radiation is to use heterodyne photomixing by two lights of around ~0.8-micron incident on a low temperature grown GaAs photomixer. Another technique is to use quantum cascade lasers to obtain THz radiation with no frequency tunability and working at low temperature, and more cascade lasers are required with the decrease of THz. The third technique is to use a femto second laser within an optical bench with low output average power. Photonic technologies at 1.55 micron have been well established and explored for information and telecommunication sector. We will investigate and develop an integrated terahertz frequency generator by heterodyne photomixing of two lights at around 1.55-micron to obtain THz radiation from 100 GHz to 6 THz. The generator is composed of a dual-mode and tunable quantum-dot phase-locked semiconductor laser at around 1.55 micron, a high-power quantum-dot semiconductor amplifier, an ultrafast photomixer (low-temperature grown InGaAs) and a THz antenna. This THz generator will be cost-effective, robust, very compact, and integrated. The THz generator can be used for both sensing and communications. The applications include (1) detection of biological, medical and pharmaceutical science including biomolecules, medicines, cancer tissue, DNA, drug, proteins and bacteria, (2) semiconductor and other industrial applications including material evaluations, inspection of silicon solar cells, nanocomposites, polyfilms and dielectric films and fault analysis, (3) security screening including identifying signature of every explosive and narcotic, (4) information and communication technology including indoor and outdoor high speed wireless communications with possible 10 Gb/s in the future, (5) earth and space science including pollution analysis and observation, and gas sensing, and (6) basic science including food quality control.","Integrated terahertz frequency generator","Medical equipment and apparatus",CANADA,CANADA,"Biomedical technology"
"Future high capacity wireless access networks require new technologies for distribution. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation has been considered to provide many technical benefits over the current or conventional modulation technologies. 



To obtain high capacity wireless access, there are typically two technologies: ultra wideband (UWB) OFDM wireless communications and millimeter-wave OFDM wireless communications. In the both cases, radio over fiber technology is required to distribute wireless signals to remote sites from a central site. 



For this project we will explore enabling technologies for multiband OFDM UWB and millimeter-wave wireless communications using radio over fiber technology for distribution.  There are 14 channels in UWB and 4 channels in millimeter-wave wireless. Each channel can deliver data of up to 480 Mb/s in UWB, and 1.5 Gb/s for millimeter-wave. Therefore, with the help of the radio over fiber system both UWB and millimeter-wave wireless communications can provide high capacity service over a large coverage, such as an office building, a hospital, and an airport etc.

       

It is believed that such a research project is unique in Canada that it will significantly contributes to IT technologies and Canadian industries.

"What is the most important concern when one sits on the airplane or drives a car? It would not be surprising for the answer to be the ""safety"" of the airplane or car. This is an issue relevant to the reliability, safety and fault-tolerant control of such types of safety-critical systems. Improving the reliability and safety of safety-critical systems, such as airplanes, space vehicles, automobiles, nuclear power plants, chemical or petrochemical plants, is extremely important since the consequences of failures in such systems can be catastrophic. It is necessary to design control systems that are capable of tolerating potential failures in these systems to improve the reliability and availability whilst providing desirable performance. This type of control systems is often known as Fault-Tolerant Control Systems (FTCS). In particular, FTCS applied to flight control are referred to as Fault-Tolerant Flight Control Systems (FTFCS).



The main objective of this proposed research is to provide advanced and practical solutions for FTFCS design and analysis which incorporate realistic physical constraints and practical considerations in FTFCS so that the results from this research are relevant and directly applicable to the aerospace industries in Canada.



The short-term objectives are to develop, analyze and test different and effective FTFCS designs based on high-fidelity and highly nonlinear aircraft models in realistic test environments. Advanced and practical schemes for fault diagnosis and reconfigurable flight control in the presence of actuators and control surfaces failures and severe engine separation damages of wings during flight or landing phase will be developed. The long-term objectives are to develop a complete theory of FTFCS ranging from analysis, synthesis, simulation, flight simulator test, and practical engineering applications and to transfer the developed fault-tolerant flight control technologies to Canadian aeronautical and aerospace industries with a competitive edge.

"The aim of this research proposal is to develop computational techniques to characterize and model the recognition between transcription factor and its binding sites. Transcription factors (TFs) are very important proteins in the cell that bind to the promoter or other regulatory regions of genes and modulate their transcription activity. Mutations on the transcription factors or their binding sites often result in the genes being transcribed and proteins produced at the wrong time or wrong place; thus are often the causes of cancer or other disorders. 



It has proved to be very challenging to predict these transcription factor binding sites by computational methods, mostly because most of the binding sites do not have a consensus and well defined motif sequence. Working with our collaborators, we are taking an integrative approach in tackling this problem. Our collaborators have developed a new technology, Protein Binding Microarrays (PBMs), which can measure the binding affinity between a particular transcription factor and large number of short DNA sequences in a high-throughput manner. My group is developing a new generation of method in representing and analyzing TF binding sites, which can utilize the biophysical and conformational properties of the DNA double helix and overcome the limitation of traditional Position Specific Weight Matrices (PSWM) approach. We are also applying molecular dynamics and docking algorithms to simulate the binding process between the transcription factor and DNA short sequences. Combining sequence analysis with structure modeling, we aim to be able to predict and explain the binding affinity data determined from the microarray experiments. 



We hope that, by taking an integrated approach and utilizing the most recent experimental data, our research can offer new insight on the discriminatory recognition between transcription factors and their binding target sites.

"The proposed research will focus on analyzing manufacturing and service systems in a stochastic environment. Random factors, such as random demand and/or random supply processes, lead to congestion problems in service and production systems, and can manifest as unexpectedly high arrival rates at a border-crossing, customers having to wait in line, backed-up job orders, inventory shortfalls, or service/supply interruptions. 



Reducing congestion requires a better match between supply and demand and improves the efficiency or productivity of systems. To design better systems or systems control policies, system performance measures and system dynamics need to be quantified. This can be accomplished by using queueing models, stochastic dynamic programming, non-linear optimization techniques, and game theory as outlined in this research proposal.

"In recent years, many protein products have been successfully expressed in various genetically engineered organisms and tested for use as new, more potent or safer drugs, more selective and active enzymes, and health foods. Joint efforts from bio-scientists and engineers are needed to produce these proteins at desired rates inexpensively, easily and in a fully functional form. Under this proposal, funds are requested for conducting a complete set of tasks to develop technologies for the environmentally friendly and cost-efficient production of recombinant protein products, using genetically-engineered algae, carbon dioxide and/or other inexpensive carbon sources, light illumination, and other simple media in fully controlled photo-bioreactors.

"Take Control Cosmedix is an Ontario based company with a line of camouflage or cosmetic corrective materials. These materials are used in a host of applications including temporary reconstruction and repair of scarred tissue such as in burn patients. In order to improve on the performance of current suite of materials that are available through Take Control Cosmedix, its founder, Brandy Gowling has teamed up with an adhesion and materials scientist from the University of Waterloo, Dr. Boxin Zhao. The needs to be met in this application are to examine the methods of generating better adhesion between the cosmetic reconstruction materials, which are silicone based, and the skin surface layer and to develop novel methods of replicating the surface structure to silicone parts molded in the appropriate anatomical form and avoiding the current practice of using dermal adhesives.

"As future technological innovations gear towards miniaturizing machines and maximizing performance density, our challenges as engineers and scientists become our ability to build micro- and nano-machines and understand phenomena at a scale we normally do not deal with. This proposal is devoted to investigating the adhesion and contact dynamics of new polymeric coating and adhesive materials at the microscopic, nanoscopic and molecular levels, and to obtaining mechanistic information about the performance of these coating and adhesive layers under lateral and normal stress/strain conditions in order to translate them for effective applications.  The research program will seek inspirations from such biological designs as the foot pads of little lizards - geckos. Geckos, having millions of finger-like nanoscopic fibrils on their foot pads, can readily and rapidly attach to almost any surface (whether it be hydrophilic or hydrophobic, rough or smooth, dry or wet) and detach just as readily and rapidly.  In contrast, conventional engineering adhesives require careful surface preparations, and often fail to adhere in the presence of water and other contaminants. This research program will combine chemical modification techniques at the molecular level and surface patterning at the nano- and micro-levels to fabricate new types of coating and adhesive thin films, and conduct detailed surface force (adhesion and friction) measurements to characterize these biomimetic adhesive materials. The ultimate goal is to discover and define novel adhesive and coating strategies and approaches for tailor-made properties that can be incorporated into synthetic polymers for robust and adaptable bonding. The program, working at the frontier of surface and interfacial science and engineering, will generate new knowledge at the microscopic, nanoscopic, and molecular levels which have technological implications for chemicals and materials, and biomedical applications, and provide a much needed multi-disciplinary training to highly qualified personnel that will improve the competitiveness of our Canadian economy and benefit mankind as well.

"The evolution of software radio has enabled wireless network devices to dynamically reconfigure their air interfaces. As a result, network protocols and resource management should fully exploit the advantages provided by this flexibility. Although extensive work has been done to enable network reconfiguration at the physical layer, little has been done to study issues related to quality of service (QoS) provisioning and resource management in a network where stations can dynamically reconfigure their air interfaces. In the proposed project we will study important issues in allocating radio resources for supporting multimedia services in reconfigurable wireless networks. The objective of this research is to provide solutions and technologies so that mobile stations can keep their traffic always best connected by dynamic and adaptive reconfigurations, and the precious radio resources can be efficiently utilized. Specifically, we will propose strategies for mobile stations to adaptively select their air interfaces, design admission control and transmission scheduling schemes for networks to effectively support the QoS of multimedia traffic, and provide solutions to ensure smooth connections during and after reconfigurations.  The basic approach is to take into consideration both horizontal and vertical information in a reconfigurable network in order to optimize the resource allocation performance, where horizontal information comes from sub-networks using different air interfaces, and vertical information is from different layers of the network protocol stack.  The outcomes of this research will contribute towards future always-best-connected networks and benefit network operators, mobile users, and equipment manufacturers. This work will benefit the Canadian telecommunication industry by attracting more investments in wireless networks and encouraging more mobile wireless users.

"The quality measurement of image, video, speech and audio is of critical importance for today's audio and video broadcasting, telephony networks, transmission control, and e-commerce, mainly because quality is both a key determinant of customer satisfaction and a key indicator of transmission condition. Although subjective quality evaluation has been the most reliable method of audiovisual quality assessment, it is highly unsuitable for online monitoring and broadcasting applications, and is also very expensive and time consuming. The current existing objective quality evaluation metrics require original signal to evaluate audiovisual quality. Original signal is not available for some important applications. We propose to evaluate audiovisual quality based on digital watermarking. The basis of the proposed research is that the carefully embedded watermark in an audiovisual signal will undergo the same distortion as the host audiovisual signal does. The audiovisual quality can be measured based on the degradation of the extracted watermark, by referring to an ideal mapping curve between the true detection rate and a particular commonly used quality metric including human subjective evaluation. The watermarking based quality evaluation does not need the original signal and can be very accurate. To deliver audio and video data over the Internet or wireless networks in real time with high quality, it is important to develop simple, robust error-concealment and coding strategies. The idea of including additional perceptually transparent information using audio/video watermarking to help for the recovery of packet or frame losses can also lead to several advantages. A component of the proposed research is therefore to investigate the use of watermarking-based packet loss concealment schemes for audiovisual signals, compression restoration in transmission of video, and adaptive coding and transmission of speech signal over ad-hoc wireless networks.","Quality evaluation and enhancement of audiovisual signals based on digital watermarking","Information systems and technology",CANADA,CANADA,"Image processing"

Subjective quality evaluation is highly unsuitable for online monitoring and broadcasting applications and is also very expensive and time consuming. The existing objective quality measurement metrics need the original signal for comparison.

We propose to measure the quality of audiovisual signals based on digital watermarking. Our recent research achievements have demonstrated the feasibility and promise. We believe that we will be able to propose methods that can measure the quality of not only image and speech, but also video and audio; that can measure the effects of not only JPEG compression and MP3 compression, but also all kinds of common distortions to image, video, speech and audio; and that can measure the effects of not only individual distortion, but also combined multiple distortions. The envisaged quality measurement methods will significantly contribute to the video and audio broadcasting and telephony industries, and other areas such as forensic analysis and content authentication.

"The world is demanding more from wireless communication services now than ever before. Many new wireless applications, such as internet access, mobile office, and adult entertainment are emerging. With the increasing demand for wireless communications, the issues of how to improve system performance, such as increased system capacity, enhanced system throughput, lowered transmit power, and improved Quality of Service (QoS), have attracted great research interests in recent years.



Diversity technique has been an important approach to combat fading in wireless communications. Recently, there is great research attention on multiuser diversity, which can be realized by exploring cooperative transmission. The basic idea of cooperative transmission is to create multiple channels for each user, while each user is equipped with only one transmit antenna, to deliver his/her information to the destination. As a result, spatial diversity gain can be achieved in the presence of channel fading.



For a wireless network operating in a fading environment, power and bandwidth are precious radio resources which need careful planning. With the introduction of user cooperation, the radio resource management problem faces increased degree of freedom. In this proposal, we aim to work on the design of the advanced radio resource management strategies for cooperative communication protocols. The proposed cooperative protocol should maintain diversity gain, compensate the rate loss due to relaying transmission, and justify the hardware complexity. The following three aspects of a wireless network design issues will be investigated: (1) Joint rate and power allocation. (2) Joint power/rate allocation and partner selection in a network environment. (3) Cooperation application in wireless sensor network (WSN).

"All living organisms on the earth are continuously exposed to a variety of environmental stresses. Organisms such as plants do not have the ability to move and escape from the stresses and are more frequently affected adversely. Naturally, plants like most other organisms develop complex mechanisms to sensor and cope with environmental stresses. Molecular chaperones are a group of proteins, most of which are highly induced by heat shock and therefore termed as heat shock proteins (HSP), to help other proteins to function properly under stress conditions. Molecular chaperones are also important in the maintenance of proper activities of other proteins under normal growth conditions and serve as critical players in the cellular protein quality control system. I am proposing a research program to study a particular set of molecular chaperones termed HSP90 in the model plant Arabidopsis and to explore what other proteins are aided by Arabidopsis HSP90 for their proper functions under both normal and stress conditions. Arabidopsis contains seven HSP90 genes. This study will investigate the biochemical properties of two Arabidopsis HSP90s which are localized in chloroplast and endoplasmic reticulum and the mechanism of action of plant HSP90s as sensors of environmental stresses, and will identify, by proteomics approaches, targets which can be potentially used for future breeding of crops with better resistance to biotic or abiotic stresses. The proposed research program will also complement the research on HSP90 in mammalian cells, where this protein is currently used as a target for cancer research.","Investigation of the molecular chaperone HSP90 in arabidopsis: its function in plant development, organelle physiology and biogenesis",Agriculture,CANADA,CANADA,"Protein manipulation and expression"

"In the past decades, advance in multimedia, communications and networking technologies has led to the proliferation of multimedia data in government, military, and commercial applications. However, the illegal alteration and unauthorized redistribution poses serious threats to multimedia security and intellectual property rights, and raises a critical issue of protecting multimedia content and enforcing digital rights. The emerging technology of digital fingerprinting embeds unique labels (known as fingerprints) into multimedia content, and provides proactive forensic tools for the content owner to track the usage of multimedia data and identify the source of the illicit copies. Multimedia fingerprinting involves a lot of users with conflicting objectives. They influence each other's decisions and performance, and the complex dynamics among users make the problem of reliable and trustworthy traitor tracing very challenging. To support multimedia forensics, in this proposal, we plan to 1) formulate the dynamics among users and understand how they interact with and respond to each other; 2) investigate how such user dynamics affect the traitor tracing performance of multimedia fingerprinting; and 3) in the long term, build a multimedia fingerprinting framework that provides trustworthy and reliable traitor tracing performance. We also propose to build a multimedia security and forensic center to study the underlying principles and theories, verify the technologies, and advance the young field of digital forensics. 



The anticipated significance of the proposed research includes: 1) uncovering the importance of behavior forensics and multimedia fingerprinting; 2) opening a new research direction in media security; and 3) addressing timely issues of practical importance.

"This research program is aimed at the global dynamics of nonlinear evolution systems with spatial and temporal heterogeneities, which are inspired by population biology and epidemiology. We will study the existence, uniqueness and global stability of steady states and periodic solutions, persistence and extinction, global converegnce and attractors, the existence, uniqueness and stability of traveling waves, and asymptotic speeds of spread (in short, spreading speeds). In this project we also propose to obtain general results on spreading speeds and monostable traveling waves for abstract evolution systems, the existence and global stability of bistable waves for monotone semiflows, and basic reproduction numbers for nonautonomous epidemic models.

                                                                  

The investigation methods involve dynamical systems, Liapunov functions, upper-lower solutions, perturbations and bifurcations, comparison principle, skew-product semiflows, linearization, nonlinear analysis, and numerical simulations. The novelty of the research lies in the dynamical systems approach to evolution equations with spatial-temporal structure.

                                      

The proposed research is expected to establish the mathematical theory of spatial-temporal dynamics and biological invasions, and to develop the theory of nonautonomous dynamical systems. Progress in this project can also help to answer important questions such as whether and how a community of interacting populations can persist (avoid extinction) or whether an infectious disease becomes endemic in a population, to estimate the speeds of biological invasion and epidemic spreading, and to understand biological phenomena such as spatial-temporal patterns and  wave propagations.

"In the dairy industry, mastitis is the most costly disease that causes significant losses in economic and milk production terms. As well, mastitis is an animal welfare issue and use of antibiotics to treat mastitis is of concern for food and environmental safety. While many bacteria can cause bovine mastitis, one of the major causes is Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). S. aureus mastitis is contagious and extremely difficult to control because it usually develops into a chronic infection due to the ability of S. aureus to adhere, invade, and persist in mammary epithelial cells. S. aureus strains from intramammary infection produce many cell surface-associated products. The exact pathogenic roles of most of the products and their effects on adhesion and invasion are not well evaluated. It is also known that mammary epithelial cell-associated molecules interact with S. aureus during the pathogenesis of mastitis, but their roles on adhesion and invasion have not been characterized. The interaction between S. aureus and bovine mammary glands is very complex. The global objective of this proposed research is to use ClfA, a surface protein on S. aureus, as a model molecule to study the mechanisms by which surface adhesins of S. aureus attach to and invade bovine mammary epithelial cells and how epithelial cells respond to the infection. Specifically, this proposed study aims to answer the following questions: (1) How does gene expression change in both S. aureus and bovine mammary epithelial cells during their interactions? (2) How does the varying length of the repeats in ClfA from different strains or isolates of S. aureus affect the binding and invasion to mammary epithelial cells? (3) Is it possible to identify and isolate the receptors on bovine mammary epithelial cells? Results from this proposed study will shed more light on the pathogenic mechanisms of S. aureus and consequently provide new strategies for a better prevention, therapy program and management of bovine mastitis. It is not envisaged that this research will lead to any vaccine development. Nevertheless, this research program will certainly contribute to our basic understanding of the interaction between S. aureus and the bovine mammary gland.","Interaction between S. aureus and bovine mammary epithelial cells","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)",CANADA,CANADA,"Animal biology"

"Regression models are commonly used to study the association between a response variable and a set of covariates.  Standard inference methods can be directly applied when there is no selection bias (e.g. in simple random sampling design) and the objects selected in the sample are fully observed.  However in practice many studies involve some combination of selection bias, missing or mismeasured data.  The objectives of the proposed research program are: (i) development and application of estimation methods which can deal with missing or mismeaured data with selection bias; and (ii) investigation of optimal sampling strategies for two-phase or multi-phase studies which maximize the information in observed data.



Models explored under (i) will include the generalized linear models and partially linear models where certain variables (response or covariates) are missing either by design (e.g. two-phase study) or happenstance and auxiliary information is sometime available.  Our recent work in this area based on semiparametric models and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm has several promising results for both response and covariates missing problems, and it can efficiently use auxiliary information to improve estimation efficiency and at the same time reduce estimation bias.  Further investigation in this area will considerably enhance statistical inference both in theory and application.



Two-phase or multi-phase studies produce data with certain variables missing by design.  Research topics under (ii) will be conducted jointly with the efficient estimation methods under (i).  In the proposed research we will consider numerical methods to investigate potential improvements of optimal design over the balanced design for different settings and develop optimal sampling strategies for more general settings.  If successfully developed and implemented the methodology will be widely used.

"The proposed research mainly focuses on a new method for solving nonlinear multiperiod Markov decision models in a setting of dynamic risk management. It involves a design process for highly sophisticated dynamic models applicable to risk management activities. This process can be naturally divided into three steps.



First, theoretical models for state variables will be established based on the structure of the system and the control objectives and constraints. The proposed model takes  a set of state indicators as primary sources of risk and characterizes the state dynamics with Markov processes.



Second, up-to-date databases will be acquired and used for the estimation of model parameters and validation of the model itself. Highly efficient statistical and simulation algorithms, such as the adapted Expectation and Maximization algorithm, are applied in the estimation procedures.



Third, Markov decision models will be formulated and solved to obtain the optimal decision rules and their practical implications. Using a popular risk management measure, such as Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk, as the objective function of minimizing risk, the optimal policy is obtained through large-scale stochastic dynamic programming techniques. A novelty of this research is the  decomposition solution technique for multiperiod nonlinear stochastic programming models. 



The intention of the research program is to build  realistic models for dynamic control under uncertainty and to study efficient solution algorithms for theoretically intractable problems.

"Fabrication of ultraminiaturized devices and machinery is the ultimate goal of modern nanotechnology. To achieve this goal, the use of single molecules as basic functional units for various electronic/photonic devices has been envisioned as the most promising approach. This proposal is aimed at exploring carbon-rich organic molecules or macromolecules (oligomers, fullerene, and carbon nanotubes) and their applications as the building blocks for nanoscale electro/photoactive materials. These designed nanomaterials are expected to exhibit extraordinary and unprecedented physical and optical properties that are not easily attainable otherwise from conventional bulk materials. 

    In the proposed work, a series of novel conjugated oligomers, i.e. large organic molecules possessing highly delocalized pi-electron density, will be targeted, with the molecular structures specifically tailored to have unique two-dimensional topologies. As such, complex pi-electronic interactions and compelling molecular properties will arise, enabling the electronic and photonic behavior to be manipulated or fine-tuned on the nanometer scale. Furthermore, these oligomeric/polymeric compounds will be hybridized with two important carbon nanomaterials, namely [60]fullerene and carbon nanotubes, through chemical functionalization methods. The resulting hybrid materials are anticipated to possess not only the combined features of each individual components, but some new molecular functions as a result of the intricate interplay of pi-electrons among those active moieties at the molecular level. In practical terms, these proposed nanomaterials may find appealing applications in our daily lives, for example, plastic solar cells, chemical and biological sensors, high-performance optical devices for computing and information storage, etc. Implementation of the proposed study will have a significant impact on both fundamental knowledge and technological applications of modern carbon nanomaterials.

"The intracellular membrane trafficking pathways connect the organelles of the eukaryotic endomembrane system.  In plants, these pathways play important roles in the biosynthesis and accumulation of proteins, lipids and polysaccharides that literally feed, clothe and house the world. Beyond this, they have also been recognized as central to wider aspects of plant cell development and cellular adaptation to environmental stresses.

       The overall goal of my research is to understand how plant genes control intracellular membrane trafficking as cell morphology changes during plant development and in cellular responses to environmental stresses. Small Rab GTPases are key membrane trafficking regulators. In Arabidopsis, 57 putative Rabs are identified and clarified into 18 structural subclasses, yet only few have been functionally studied. Following our recent characterization of the Rab-D2 and Rab-E1 subclasses, we propose to investigate the function of the Rab-A1 subclass in membrane trafficking, cell signaling, cell morphogenesis, and stress adapation. We will test the roles of Rab-A1s in membrane trafficking using a dominant negative mutant approach combined with in vivo imaging of fluorescent markers co-expressed in plant cells. We will also determine the tissue specificity and subcellular localization of each Rab-A1 members, and generate knockout mutants for loss-of-function studies. A split ubiquitin-based cDNA library will be constructed and screened for Rab-A1 and Rab-E1 interacters in order to dissect Rab-mediated signaling pathways. In addition, we also plan on characterizing and cloning three novel membrane trafficking mutants identified in a genetic screen based on the intracellular accumulation of a secretory GFP in an EMS-mutagenized population. 

       Our work will 1) give molecular and cellular details on how plants, as multicellular organisms are developed, 2) provide fresh insight into how plants deal with prevailing environment, and 3) shed light on how valuable proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides are accumulated in the plant endomembrane system. This knowledge can be used to develop technologies of benefit to agriculture and biotechnology.

"Worldwide efforts are undergoing vigorously with cutting-edge technologies in order to develop ultra-clean diesel engines that can outperform the current and upcoming regulations in power requirement, energy efficiency, and environmental concerns. The recent work indicates that the low temperature combustion (LTC) in diesel engines is capable of producing diesel-like fuel efficiency and emitting ultra-low oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), which can be implemented by the heavy use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) or the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) type of combustion. However, conversely to high temperature combustion (HTC), little is known about the intermediate processes of LTC in a time-resolved manner, especially under high loads. The shortfall has limited the LTC ignition controllability and load applicability of the engine. In order to better understand and improve the LTC process, this research proposes the following objectives:

(a) To investigate the formation of NOx, soot, and unburned hydrocarbons (uHC) in the combustion chamber with time-resolved and space-resolved direct sampling;

(b) To innovate combustion control techniques targeting 5ppm of NOx via adaptive multi-pulse fuel injection and closed-loop EGR and boost control, by on-line analyzing the time-resolved correlations between the multi-pulse fuel injection and the fuel mixing and reaction;

(c) To investigate and improve the effectiveness of the post flame on PM and uHC oxidations in both HTC and LTC modes by analyzing the formation and destruction profiles of each targeted species;

(d) To investigate the formation mechanisms of NOx, PM, uHC and CO in LTC modes by correlating the crank-angle-resolved measurement data with the modeling results and thus to improve the simulation;

(e) To reduce the cycle-by-cycle variations of the combustion process by analyzing the cycle-resolved emission measurement and thus to improve the operating stability and thermal efficiency of the engine.



The direct sampling valve operates by extracting a spatially specifiable portion of cylinder charge and/or combustion products from inside of the engine combustion chamber within an assignable temporal window (~0.8ms). The gas sample is then analyzed both on-line and off-line to acquire the quantitative information of the fuel preparation and combustion process. Conversely to laser induced diagnostics, the direct gas sampling requires little engine modification and the sampling valve may operate under a peak cylinder pressure up to 220bar.



To-date, the majority of industrial researches in diesel LTC has been heavily relied on the cylinder pressure traces and the engine out emissions. The time consuming set-up and labor-intensive analyses of in-cylinder sampling has been largely beyond the comprehensions of the industry because of their higher urgency in commercial products in cutting exhaust emissions; and of the other institutions because of the demanding in equipment sophistications. Thus, the proposed research will fill the shortfalls by discovering the data that helps to understand the mechanisms of the mixture preparation and pollutant formation from the multi-event fuel injection incurred LTC in high performance modern common-rail diesel engines. The improved understanding on the intermediate processes of fuel mixing and combustion will help to gain control over LTC ignition and stability that will significantly help the industry to improve the fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions.

"Canada has large reserves of heavy oil and oilsands bitumen. Development of these vast reserves to provide clean fuel, energy and feedstock for the chemical and petrochemical industry will provide significant economic benefit for Canada. However, these heavy oil and bitumen deposits contain a large amount of hetero atoms that have to be removed. Organic sulfur/nitrogen compounds, upon combustion, can be converted into SOx and NOx, which result in acid rain. The new regulations on diesel fuels require sulfur content at the pump of 15 ppm, down from the previous 500 ppm, and it will be further reduced to 10 ppm in 2011. Meeting and exceeding the new fuel specifications presents a significant challenge to petroleum refiners, who want to achieve this at the lowest possible cost. As well, the existing hydrotreating technologies are difficult to remove sulfur compounds to less than 15 ppm.

"Canada is a leader in setting long-term and short-term targets for blending biofuels in transportation fuels. Biodiesel is biodegradable, non-toxic and can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Although biodiesel as a fuel has many desirable qualities, such as a good cetane number and lubricity, the amount of biodiesel that can be added to a petroleum diesel blend is often limited to 5% or less due to poor storage stability, marginal cold flow properties, excessive solvency and engine compatibility issues. Trans-esterification is currently the primary route for producing biofuels from vegetable oils. However, trans-esterificationbecomes very challenging when low quality oils are used as the feedstock due to the presence of undesirable components especially free fatty acids (FFAs) and water. 



Achieving widespread use of biofuels depends on the development of new process technologies. Through the proposed research, hydroprocessing technology will be investigated as a way to utilize widely available vegetable oil feedstock to produce an isoparaffin-rich diesel substitute. This product, referred to as green diesel, is an aromatic and sulfur free diesel fuel that has a very high cetane blending value. A magnetically recyclable catalyst will be developed and applied in the upgrading process to produce green diesel from bio-oils. The proposed catalyst and upgrading process will address the current challenge of upgrading bio-oils: quick deactivation of catalyst.

"There are  fundamental links between cosmology and particle physics, which have been well established at all scales. In particular,  the physics of the early Universe, baryogenesis, cosmological nucleosynthesis, etc. is based  on our modern understanding of particle physics.   This realization has made the early Universe a marvelous laboratory for studying fundamental physics, in particular the vacuum structure of the theory. Conversely, knowledge of the behavior of fundamental physics at high temperature gives information about what happened shortly after the  Big Bang.   What is more remarkable is the fact that these phenomena at the QCD scale can be, in principle, experimentally tested in heavy ion collisions at RHIC (relativistic heavy ion collider), Brookhaven National Labaratory, and in the nearest future at LHC (Geneva, Switzerland) where such unusual environment  can be achieved. The goal of the project is: the study of QCD as  part of the standard model   in an unusual environment when  temperature T, chemical potential  and the so-called theta- parameter are non-zero.  This knowledge gives a reliable information about what have happened 14 billion years ago soon after the Big Bang at the temperature T = 170 MeV. The understanding of the corresponding phase diagram (as a function of these external parameters)  is one of the most challenging problems in QCD. This problem with nonzero theta parameter has never been studied previously in the literature, though it is likely that theta parameter was non-zero during the QCD phase transition few moments after the Big Bang. Due to the  differences in  interactions between quarks and antiquarks in the presence of the theta parameter  the  local separation of baryon charges may take place. This phenomenon can be tested at RHIC. In fact,  the phenomenon of charge separation has been studied  in our recent paper    with D. Kharzeev. What is more important: this effect has  been experimentally tested at RHIC.  Preliminary results support our findings. If confirmed, it would be  the first ever observation of the P and CP  violation in strong interactions.  Second part of the project  is the application of the ideas  mentioned above  for needs of astrophysics and cosmology.

"Highway agencies and transportation organizations (e.g., regional and metropolitan planning offices) in Canada and elsewhere invest a significant portion of their budgets and manpower for collecting various data through traffic monitoring and travel survey campaigns. The data obtained are widely used in transportation planning, infrastructure design, operation analysis, traffic controls and business development. The quality of the derived information and estimated parameters is critical for wise decision-making in all of the above-noted areas. 



The proposed research involves studies aimed at improving the procedures of data collection and parameter estimation with advanced technologies and computing techniques. The proposed studies include developing a modern geographic information systems/remote sensing (GIS/RS) system to efficiently and timely support various tasks and decision-making in transportation; using advanced scientific and computing techniques to estimate traffic parameters; examining estimation accuracy of missing data resulting from the procedures used by highway agencies with simulation techniques; and coupling data from different sources for more accurate travel behavior modeling. Through these studies, the following questions regarding current systems can be answered and more cost-effective systems can be developed: How can the latest GIS/RS technologies be best used in data collection and transportation decision-making? How can more accurate procedures be developed to handle the missing data frequently encountered in these systems? Can advanced techniques be used to estimate traffic parameters more accurately? Can more accurate parameters be derived by using data from different sources and advanced techniques?

"Fibrous materials are suitable for applications involving transport, filtration, separation, absorption because they have large surface areas and highly porous structures. The development of nanofibrous materials exploits the advantages of the ultra-high surface areas of fibrous materials. Biomembranes made of nanofibres are potentially useful in many advanced application areas such as chemical or bio-defense, wound dressing, selective separation, immobilization of biologically or pharmacologically active agents and molecules, and scaffold for tissue engineering. These heterogeneous, anisotropic and compressible structures are versatile, yet challenging to researchers trying to control and optimize their properties for different applications. Up to now, an efficient and precise way to characterize the structure and the behavior of fluid transport in fibrous materials is still unavailable, but is essential for research in the field of material and biomedical sciences.  

     The proposed work will therefore focus on fundamental studies of fluid transport in fibrous structures and biomembranes, and will apply innovative multi-scale approaches to bridge the gap between our knowledge of the macroscopic transport behavior of fibrous materials, and our knowledge of the interaction among microscopic constituents of materials. To fulfill the research objectives, electrospinning equipment for nanofibre formation will be implemented; both macroscopic and microscopic techniques for characterizing surface and transport properties of fibrous materials will be used. The result of the proposed fundamental studies will provide groundwork in the development of fibrous materials or biomembranes for a wide variety of end uses, including absorption/adsorption, filtration, bio-separation, bio-defense, and membranes supporting smart materials, or tissue engineering. The proposed studies will lead to commercial and economic benefits: by developing high value-added products; the provincial and Canadian textile and material industry will enhance its competitiveness and increase its proportion of the textile market in technical sectors, contributing to the country's economic growth and job creation.

"Excitable cells in the brain, heart, nerves, muscle, and other organs and tissues change their functional state in response to electrical and chemical signals. These important physiological processes are controlled by ion channels, which enable fast and selective permeation of various ions across cell membranes. The crucial physiological role of ion channels has made them targets for deadly toxins synthesized by various organisms as attack or defense weapons. The human genome has 76 genes that encode potassium channel proteins, which are the most diverse group of ion channels. Mutations in some potassium channel genes cause severe inherited disorders such as cardiac arrhythmias. Potassium channel blockers are used for the treatment of diabetes, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and other autoimmune diseases. Some cardiovascular and neurological disorders are also treated with drugs, which target potassium channels. Understanding structure, dynamics, and pharmacology of potassium channels is important for basic knowledge and for designing new drugs. X-ray crystallography revealed atomic-resolution three-dimensional structures of several potassium channels in the open and closed states. These structures can be used in computer-based molecular modeling studies aimed to predict and visualize complexes of the channels with various drugs. In this project, powerful parallel computers and sophisticated software will be employed to predict binding sites of various drugs in several potassium channels, to simulate dynamics of the channel proteins and predict complexes of the channels with various drugs. The computer-generated molecular models will help better understand mechanisms of drug action in potassium channels. In collaboration with leading scientists in USA and Germany, the models will be experimentally verified and used to design new experiments. The study will provide information, which may help design new potent and selective drugs.

"The main objective of the proposed research is to build an innovative PEM fuel cell through the design and manufacture of Membrane Electrolyte Assembly (MEA) and bipolar plate. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Palcan Power Systems Inc. at Vancouver, BC. Over the last decade, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell power systems have attracted significant attention from the Canadian government and researchers. Because of its zero-emission feature with pure hydrogen, the PEM fuel cell has become the most promising power source for future vehicles. However, PEM fuel cell designs suffer from short lifetime, high cost, and low performance, although their practical efficiency is usually higher than that of the internal combustion engine. Therefore, significantly innovative design of PEM fuel cells is a must to achieve the commercialization of PEM fuel cells. We will approach our main objective by using both numerical and experimental methods to test our designs. We will improve and apply our own 3-dimensional mathematical model (with multi-phase with built-in water-gas-interface tracking, multi-component, detailed electro-chemical sub-models) and our own experimental facility to PEM fuel cell design and optimizations. With both the simulation tool and experimental testing facility, more accurate results can be obtained, and more operating conditions can be optimized. The best of the designs will be selected based on both the numerical and experimental results. The innovative design of PEM fuel cell will be achieved component by component. It is expected that this research will significantly influence PEM fuel cell commercialization processes and quickly bring this clean technology to fruition. It is also expected that our research results will bring great economical benefits to Canada's fuel cell industry thereby providing more job opportunities for Canadians. Successful commercialization of PEM fuel cells will also provide significant environmental benefits to all Canadians due to the clean nature of PEM fuel cell technology.","Innovative Design and Manufacture of MEA and Bipolar Plate","Energy storage and conversion",CANADA,CANADA,"Mechanical engineering"
"Fuel cells are highly energy efficient and environment friendly. Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) convert the chemical energy of hydrogen and oxygen directly into electric energy with the only byproduct being water and heat, and are regarded as the most promising candidate as a zero-emission power source for transportation and many other applications.

      The most critical challenges facing the commercialization of fuel cells are substantial cost reduction and performance improvement. Water and thermal management is one of the key technologies for achieving high performance of PEMFCs. Water (especially liquid water) and thermal management directly affect a fuel cell stack performance in terms of reliability, durability and efficiency.

      The principle investigator's group has successfully developed a comprehensive three-dimensional General Model of PEMFC for a single cell and a comprehensive dynamic model for a PEMFC stack to deal with two-phase flow and transport mechanisms; also a Fuel Cell Test Stand has been successfully built and employed to investigate fuel cell performance. These efforts have shown that if a stack can be made by an integrated design and control, it will be much easier to optimize water and thermal management of the PEMFC stack so that a more reliable and durable stack with high efficiency can be achieved.

      In this proposal some innovative fuel cell stack designs will be proposed and characterized, a corresponding control-oriented stack system model and system controller will be proposed and tested to improve the fuel cell capability of coping with transient vehicle power demands with a stable high efficiency. 

      This study will have an immediate influence on the design and optimization of practical PEMFC stacks. The results of the proposed research will enhance the performance and reduce the cost of PEMFCs; along with highly qualified personnel trained and the expertise developed, this project will expand and enhance Canada's competitive capability in fuel cell research and development and in relevant industries, e.g, auto industry.

"Since the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation of ultra cold atoms, there have been tremendous experimental and theoretical efforts to understand how each individual atom cooperates with others at nanokelvin temperatures and how fascinating correlations between cold atoms manifest themselves in various experiments. Milestone experiments in this field include the observation of superfluid-Mott insulating state transitions of rubidium atoms in optical lattices, the observation of Tonk-Girardeau gases, the observation of molecules and superfluids near Feshbach resonances of lithium or potassium atoms. It is widely accepted that many most sophisticated physical systems such as quantum condensed matter systems can be effectively simulated using cold atoms and one of the forefronts of cold atom research is to use ultra cold matter to investigate various outstanding issues of many-body physics. Optical lattices provide fascinating and unique opportunities to study superfluids, quantum magnetism and coherent quantum dynamics, and will lead to various breakthroughs in our understanding of fundamentals of interacting ultra cold atoms. These studies will shed light not only on how cold atoms behave at nanokelvin temperatures, but also on our understanding of issues such as high temperature superconductivity, quantum computation; the impact can go far beyond atomic, molecular and optics physics. This proposal focuses on correlations between ultra cold atoms in extreme quantum limits; especially, a) superfluids near Feshbach resonances and lattice Feshbach resonances; b) hyperfine spin correlated matter of ultra cold atoms, or more generally quantum magnetism in optical lattices; c) creation and detection of fractionalized topological excitations and detection of spin correlations of cold atoms; d) beyond-mean-field coherent dynamics especially coherent spin dynamics.

"Submerged membrane bioreactor technologies have experienced unprecedented growth in wastewater treatment and reuse because of excellent solid separation efficiency.  However, vigorous sparging aeration is required in order to shear the deposited particles away from the membrane surface, resulting in high energy consumption.  The purpose of the proposed study is to develop and apply new dual membrane bioreactor processes (DMBR) consisting of two separate sets of membrane modules submerged in bioreactors.  One set of membrane modules is used for bubbleless aeration to drastically increase the oxygen transfer efficiency and/or provide the media for biofilm growth while another remains for solid separation.  Another distinct feature is that DMBR processes can be operated to create both aerobic and anaerobic environments across the biofilm in a single system, allowing the co-metabolism of refractory organic microppolutants while minimizing their loss from air stripping



Extensive experiments will be conducted to examine the feasibility of two DMBR systems to treat both artificial and raw municipal wastewater in terms of effluent quality, permeate flux and aeration efficiency.  As well, their applications to remove volatile organic compounds, endocrine disrupting chemicals and pharmaceuticals will be explored because of their increasing environmental concerns in practice.  Emphasis will be placed on the understanding of fundamental physical transport, chemical and biological transformation processes occurring in the DMBRs and the development of effective fouling control strategies.  The results will greatly benefits Canadian municipalities and environmental consulting firms with more effective, economic membrane bioreactor technologies to meet the requirements of stricter regulatory discharge limits.

"My research interests in robust statistics include robust designs and robust inferences. Four research projects are proposed in this application to study robust design of experiments, robust estimation and inference for time series analysis and pattern recognition, and optimal fractional factorial designs.



Robust statistics in general studies statistical procedures which are not sensitive to small departures (small deviations) from model assumptions or small proportion of contamination in the data.  In practice, model assumptions are usually violated and the presence of  outliers is common for large data sets, so robust methods are desired.



Robust and optimal designs have applications in agricultural experiments, environmental experiments, clinical trials and etc. Optimal fractional factorial designs are often used in the screening experiments in industry such as designing products.  Robust time series analysis and pattern recognition have many applications which include studying the movements of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or Huntington's disease (HD) in medical research. This research will help medical researchers to differentiate the movements between PD patients and HD patients. 



In the next few years, I will try to make contributions in theory and methods in robust and optimal designs, robust inference for time series and pattern recognition.

"Nitinol, a group of NiTi alloys with compositions near equiatomic nickel and titanium, finds increasing applications in medical and actuator devices, etc. because of unique properties, such as shape memory effect, pseudo-elasticity and biocompatibility. However, joining (welding, brazing and soldering) of Nitinol is generally difficult, which in turn limits flexibility in the design and fabrication of Nitinol devices and hence impedes high volume commercialization of the alloys. 



The current proposal seeks a systematic study of laser microwelding of Nitinol aiming to improve understanding of the effects of Nitinol base metal conditions, laser welding process parameters and post-weld heat treatment on the joint microstructure and mechanical properties. It is planned also to investigate and develop the use of Ni-Ti foil inserts to modify/improve mechanical properties and corrosion performance of the joints, as compared to joints without inserts and to the base metal. 



The proposed work would strengthen Canada's position in the fields of design and fabrication of medical devices and other microsystems in general, and advanced materials joining and microjoining in particular.  Specifically, the knowledge and engineering know-how developed in this proposed work will make significant contributions (in terms of journal and conference publications) to the science and technology of Nitinol laser joining. It will also provide engineering guidelines to optimize the process conditions and to increase flexibility for design and fabrication of Nitinol devices.

"Padï¿½ approximants are a rational generalization of Taylor series and have been studied for over a century. Hermite's proof of transcendence of e involved constructing such approximants. His student Padï¿½ explored the approximants systematically and got his name attached to them. The study of multivariate Padï¿½ approximants is relatively new, partly because of the computation difficulties involved, and lends itself to experimentation with computer algebra packages. Part of our intention is to make as much of the study as systematic as possible, and to construct as many of the explicit approximants as we can. In the past few years, we successfully constructed explicit multivariate Padï¿½ approximants to some multivariate functions. Part of this proposal is to keep the momentum and explore more explicit constructions.

 

There are many exciting mathematical and physical applications of these constructions that cover the spectrum from Number Theory to Signal Processing. We already have had several applications in Number Theory, and are going to explore more in Number Theory, Analysis, and Signal Processing.

 

Another part of this proposal is to study various convergence problems of Fourier series. Fourier series are a type of trigonometric series and their convergence problems are always fundamental in Fourier Analysis and applications. Finding the weakest condition on the coefficients of the series so that the series is unformly convergent, i.e., finding the largest group of uniformly convergent series of some type, has been always important and we have made some important contributions.

there are relatively less collaborations going on among the defenders. The major barrier is the concern

that, shared security data may contain sensitive information, which may be disclosed and misused at a

"Sewage collection and stormwater drainage systems are a vital component of our urban infrastructure. Current systems are challenged by a combination of urban growth, climate change, and aging. In order to confidently extend the useful life of our existing sewer systems and to minimize the cost of expansions and retrofits, research on the hydraulics of the system components is urgently needed. This project proposes to investigate the performance of various drop structures in our sewer systems. Drop structures are used to connect shallow sewers to deep sewers. Two key questions in the design of drop structures will be addressed: 1) how much energy is lost at drop structures, and 2) how much air is entrained by the falling flow. Three graduate students will conduct their thesis research on this topic: one PhD student will conduct laboratory experiments on scale models of drop structures, another PhD student will conduct corresponding numerical simulations using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package, and an MSc student will carry out field measurements of our existing drop structures. The proposed study is a collaborative research effort among three professors at the University of Alberta, and engineers at Stantec Consulting and the City of Edmonton. The results of the project will be generalized to provide a basis for improving current municipal servicing guidelines.

"This program will apply advanced nonlinear control techniques to the area of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) in order to provide enhanced functionality and performance for MEMS applications. Many issues raised in the present program have not yet been addressed in MEMS literature, and there are no trivial solutions to these problems. On the other hand, MEMS exhibit rich and complex properties, providing challenging and attractive subjects from the perspective of control techniques. Hence, the proposed research will not only revolutionize the roles MEMS will play in future applications, but also lead to new classes of generic nonlinear control problems. The achievement of this program will then help fill the gap between these two areas. 

    This program aims firstly at building a solid theoretical basis for MEMS control system analysis and design while taking into account the realistic operational conditions for real-life systems. A particular attention will be paid to algorithms allowing avoiding the singularity related to the uncontrollability and to those being able to guarantee the stability of switched systems. Diverse physical properties and constraints of micro-devices will also be incorporate into MEMS control system design. Control schemes with new sensing mechanisms will be developed to make MEMS less costly, much easier to implement, and more reliable. The research work will then focus on the control of interconnected MEMS array using techniques of decentralized control of spatially distributed systems. CoventorWare and COMSOL will be used to simulate MEMS devices and an interactive simulation environment containing COMSOL and MATLAB will be built. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations and real-time experimental implementations will also be used for control system verification and validation. 

    The ultimate goal of this program is to build experimental demonstration of key components of an eye aberration diagnostic and correction system for enhanced adaptive optics (AO) systems.

"The rapid development of medical imaging technologies has led to many important applications, including computer-aided disease detection, an important component of clinical routine. Due to the inherent time/space variability of biomedical data, producing high quality information for disease diagnosis presents challenges in terms of data analysis and processing. These challenges in turn require the development of innovative theories and methods for optimal data representation. One key methodology in this area is time-frequency analysis. It provides a data representation that simultaneously reveals time and frequency variations and is excellent for data analysis and feature detection. 



The ultimate goal of my research program is to further develop time-frequency analysis techniques for biomedical applications. This research proposal is to continue the studies on the Stockwell and Hilbert-Huang transforms. Both transforms has had increasing popularity in signal and image processing community for applications in geophysics, engineering, oceanology, and biomedicine.  However, since both transforms represent recent research that originated from applications, a large number of fundamental questions remain in terms of their mathematical foundations, improvement of numerical computations, development of applications. Therefore, the objectives of this research are threefold: 1) provide a more thorough understanding of mathematical framework of the Stockwell and Hilbert-Huang transforms, 2) develop efficient and robust means to compute the transforms so that they can be more practical, and 3) identify important biomedical applications that can benefit from these advanced techniques and design new algorithms tailored for specific applications. This proposal is novel, multi-components and interdisciplinary, the results of which will uniquely combine the theoretical advancements in mathematics and numerical computation to provide better solutions for a wide range of challenging problems in biomedicine and other fields.

"Coating of pharmaceutical solid dosage forms such as tablets and beads are often required in order to improve product appearance and handle-ability, mask taste/odor, smoothen swallowing; increase patient compliance, protect product from moisture and light, and modify drug release characteristics (enteric or sustained release).  However, almost all commercial coating processes are based on liquid coating technology, with which a coating solution/suspension is sprayed onto the solid dosage forms and then the liquid gets evaporated to form a dry coating film on the surface. The most significant 

disadvantage of liquid coating is the very high cost (capital and operation) of heating the large quantity of air for drying the liquid before curing and the requirements of cleaning both the intake as well as outgoing air.



Based on a patented ultrafine powder coating technology developed by the applicant for the automobile and other industries, our preliminary study under an earlier NSERC-I2I project has shown that dry powder coating can also be applied directly on dry pharmaceutical dosage forms (tablets and beads), to realize the benefits of dry powder coating (less energy consumption and environmentally-friendly). The proposed research is to further improve on this technology, by developing a series of suitable formulations for dry powder coating, by optimizing the operating conditions, and by scaling up the process to a semi-production scale suitable for in-vitro studies, so that this technology can be successfully applied in the pharmaceutical industry.



The applicant has had many years of experience in powder processing and handling, including powder coating. The Particle Technology Research Centre at UWO and the large amount of equipment purchased through several recent CFI grants will provide the necessary infrastructure for the proposed project. The applicant also has a long collaborating relationship with the support company who also supported the earlier 121 project.

"Exogenous surfactant therapy is successfully used to treat neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) and may also be beneficial in the treatment of adult lung diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and asthma. However, results of clinical trials in the latter setting have been disappointing, in part because of the severity of the disease at the time of administration, as well as delivery limitations, as the curreni standard deliver method is by bolus instillation of a saline-surfactant suspension intratracheally. The method is also not suitable for treatment of spontaneously breathing patients, a potential requirement if earlier surfactant treatment strategies proves optimal. Aerosolization of surfactant suspensions via nebulization has not been successful to date due to inactivation of the surfactant via the nebulization process, poor efficiency of delivery as well as more practical difficulties such as foaming due to the low surface tension of the surfactant itself. Dr> powder aerosol delivery of surfactant could avoid these problems, and provide a more feasible, non-invasive and cost-effective method for surfactant delivery and even as a drug delivery vehicle for other lung-targeted therapies.   The applicant (Zhu, a powder technology engineer) has developed a novel dry powder inhalation technology for the delivery of medications to the lung, with several granted and pending patents. The proposed research aims at extending this technology to the delivery of lung surfactant, as it is capable of aerosolizing small quantities of respirable dry powder including lung surfactant, for which the co-applicant has done extensive research (Lewis, respirologist). The overall objective the current joint project is to create a new device which meets the clinical requirements for surfactant delivery. The specific objectives of this research proposal are to modify the existing inhaler technology for surfactant delivery, to evaluate the functional integrity and the efficacy of the aerosolized surfactant in-vitro first and then in vivo using a small animal model.","Pulmonary delivery of surfactant for treatment of lung diseases","Medical equipment and apparatus",CANADA,CANADA,"Transport processes"

"An earlier CRD project has demonstrated that the novel CFBBR technology developed by this research team is a very effective bioreactor and offers numerous advantages in wastewater treatment.  The main objective of the current research project is to test a different version of the above-mentioned CFBBR system, for two purposes: (1) to reduce the cost of construction and operation by providing a simpler (with lower unit height and simpler particle flow) alternative to the ""original"" CFBBR system and (2) to provide a configuration that allows easy retro-fitting of the large number of existing municipal wastewater treatment plants by this technology.  The main difference for this new unit is that both the riser and the downer will operate in the conventional fluidized bed regime.  The new version CFBBR has been patented:  It still utilizes the same attached microbial film technology for biodegradation of both organics and nutrients.  As with the original CFBBR design, this revised version of CFBBR also combines the more compact and efficient fixed-film process with the recently developed biological nutrient removal (BNR) process that provide the additional removal of nitrogen and phosphorous.  With both the vertical and horizontal versions available, the CFBBR technology can be further optimized to suit the need of a wide range of plant sizes.



This project is based on a synergistic collaboration and complementation of expertise in wastewater treatment, biochemical engineering and fluidized bed technology, and will lead to a novel and economical technique to treat both municipal and industrial wastewater.  The proposal is strongly supported by the industrial partner who will be actively involved in important discussion and key decision makings and provide advice and other supports during the entire project, in addition to cash.  In addition, 2 Ph.D. students and 1 PDF will also be trained while working on this project.

"    )	Particle technology is used in many industries especially the chemical and materials industries.  Fluidization is a very efficient method in handling powdered particles and many types of fluidized bed reactors have been developed.  In the past 30 years, high-velocity fluidized bed reactors were found to be more efficient and such high-velocity reactors include the turbulent fluidized bed reactors and the circulating fluidized bed reactors.  Turbulent bed reactors provide high reaction intensity and compact size as well as high mass transfer, but suffers from particle backmixing, while circulating bed reactors have less backmixing and high mass transfer, but are bulky and costly to build. The first proposed research project is to continue an endeavour to develop a new circulating turbulent fluidized bed reactors that combine the benefits of both.  

    )	In recent years, fluidization technology finds more and more applications in the biochemical and environmental industries, given its high mass transfer efficiency and the ability to handle a large quantity of particulate materials. The second proposed research project is to further develop a new type of gas-liquid-solid circulating fluidized bed reactors for applications in the biochemical and environmental industries.  

    )	The third proposed research project is to study in more fundamentals on the fluidization and handlability of Geldart C ultrafine powders (less than 30 microns). Those powders are extremely difficult to handle because of the extremely strong interparticle forces, that make the particles agglomerate together.  However, they are extremely useful in many industrial applications such as powder coating, pulmonary drug delivery and tablet coating, including applications using nano-sized particles. 



    )	The applicant has had extensive past experience in fluidization and particle technology and the proposed research will provide extensive training opportunities for highly qualified personnel for Canada.

"Our research program aims at the development of new polymeric materials with better biocompatibility and bioacceptance for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. Natural amphiphilic compounds such as bile acids, after proper chemical modification, are used in the preparation of new biomaterials for use in tissue engineering, drug delivery, bioseparation and biosensing. Macrocycles based on bile acids are synthesized to make new biodegradable polymers by the use of entropy-driven ring-opening metathesis polymerization techniques. Some of these materials can manifest interesting shape-memory properties and adaptable for biomedical uses. The degradation rate and mechanical properties will be tuned by copolymerization with comonomers containing different chemical bonds. Various oligomers of bile acids will be designed and prepared to make amphiphilic pockets that can solubilize either hydrophobic compounds in aqueous media or hydrophilic ones in organic media. They may act as special drug delivery vehicles and microreactors for catalysis. The materials will exhibit a balanced hydrophilicity/phobicity and undergo interesting and useful changes in physical properties upon variation of the external conditions. The amphiphilicity of such materials will also be tested for use in catalysis and biosensing. The physico-chemical study should provide an understanding of the properties of materials related to their chemical structures. Modern experimental techniques of spectroscopy and microscopy are used in the characterization of the biomaterials. The diffusion behavior and interaction of the molecules in polymer gels and solids will be studied by various solid state and solution NMR techniques. NMR imaging techniques will help to elucidate the diffusion process in different polymeric matrices. The materials will be tested and optimized for their intended applications. We expect that the results obtained are useful and important to both fundamental and practical aspects of polymer chemistry and materials science.

"This research is aiming at two different directions: one is to develop models, computation, inferences and diagnostics for count data time series, and the other one is to develop algorithms and grouping methodology for generalized cluster analysis.



Count data time series arise from dynamic phenomena or systems in environmental science, climatology, hydrology, internet administration, cancer research, insurance industry, etc., where non-negative integer-valued observations are obtained at different time points. The serial dependence and marginal characteristics are of interests. We have developed a series of models to describe various scenarios of serial dependence as well as margins. With these models developed, the computation becomes the number one concern in inferences and applications. Currently, we are developing numerical algorithms for model fitting, testing and diagnostic. In addition, we attempt to develop non-stationary models allowing time-varying features, which will further lead to a new modelling approach in GLM and longitudinal studies to permit series dependence other than the latent approach.



Cluster analysis partitions objects into different groups according to a similarity feature. Applications arise in many disciplines such as field zoning in environmetric studies, species classification in biology, etc. Classic cluster analysis uses the centroid to characterize the similarity, where one observation corresponds to one object. Generalized cluster analysis extends to other similarity characteristics, and permits a data set for each object. Using probabilistic clustering (namely finite mixture model), we are developing a data-driven algorithm for model fitting and bias reduction for estimates. Besides, we are proposing the techniques of model linking and model clustering for the situation where each object has a data set associated with many covariates.

"Waxes are white, transculent, tasteless, and odorless solids. Wax emulsions are dispersions of small wax particles in water. They are extensively used to provide water resistance and dimensional stability to products such as engineered wood panels gypsum wallboards and fibreglass products, which are widely used in automotive, building and furniture industries. In order to obtain stable wax emusions, large amount of emulsifiers are indispensable. However, these emulsifiers are always very expensive and greatly increase the prodution cost of wax emulsions. Moreover, most commercially available wax emulsifiers are not designed for wax emulsion preparation. In some cases, the presence of these emulsifiers may influence wax properties and in-turn seriously deteriorate the quality of final products. The purpose of this project is to develop novel

low-cost and high-efficiency wax emulsifiers. Our proposed emulsifiers differ fundamentally from all existing emulsifiers. Our strategy is to use chemistry method to modify a small portion of the wax stock. In this project, maleation in melt phase with the aid of free radical initiator will be used because it is cost effective. Grafting of maleic anhydride can switch the non-polar wax into a bipolar material, which can be used as an emulsifier to emulsify the wax stock. Without the use of costly emulsifiers, the production cost of wax emulsions can be greatly reduced, at the same time, the wax properties can be maximally retained. Furthermore, the wax modification degree can be readily tuned to get desired properties, such as clarity, hydrophobicity, adhesion and hardness, which may greatly improve the quality of final products. Higher maleation content will provide

waxes with better emulsifiability. In this project, we propose a feasibility study on developing a continuous process to prepare highly maleated waxes (>5wt.% maleic anhydride). The highly maleated wax is self-emulsifiable and can be used to prepare stable wax emulsions. In addition, the introduced maleic anhydride polar groups on wax will offer better dimensional stability to engineered wood panels and gypsum drywalls.","Development of novel low-costh high-efficiency wax emulsifiers","Industrial chemicals (solvents, resins)",CANADA,CANADA,"Polymers and coatings"
"Manufacturing of resins and rubbers, as well as their products, is an important industrial sector in Canada with over thirty billion annual shipments. Volume consumption of polymers is more than all other types of synthetic materials combined. Polymers are chain molecules and their properties are determined to a large extent by chain microstructure such as molecular weight, composition, branching, network, etc. Improving product quality by designing chain microstructure has been a great challenge for polymer researchers. Recent development in living radical polymerization (LRP) chemistry provides excellent opportunities. In LRP it takes several hours for individual polymer chains to fully grow, while in conventional radical polymerization it is in seconds from initiation to termination. The extended time duration makes it possible for polymer reaction engineers to design and control chain microstructure.



This proposed program is to study reaction engineering fundamentals in LRP and to develop LRP technologies that allow us to prepare polymer products having targeted chain microstructure and thus superior materials properties. It builds on our strength in polymer reaction engineering combined with our extensive experience in polymer chemistry and material science. Project #1 aims at developing kinetic models for LRP gelation. The models predict gel structural properties such as crosslink density distributions. The gel materials prepared by LRP are anticipated to have more uniform network structure than those by conventional free radical polymerization and thus better application properties. Project #2 aims at developing semi-batch LRP processes and employing them for preparation of core/shell nano-particles that have controlled shell morphologies. These polymer particles will have desirable release profiles in targeted control release applications. Project #3 aims at modifying materials surfaces by LRP grafting approaches. The grafted polymers are functional and able to self-assembled into nano-patterns for biomedical/microelectronic applications.

"Recent studies have shown that the combination of two enabling technologies, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), is the most promising wireless access scheme for the fourth-generation (4G) mobile communication systems. Channel estimation plays a key role in the future 4G systems that are based on the MIMO-OFDM technology, since the system performance largely depends on the channel state information (CSI) of the time-varying wireless environment.

    This collaborative research and development (CRD) project aims to provide a novel semi-blind channel estimation solution for the future 4G mobile communication systems. The new technology will support the latest MIMO-OFDM modulation and multiplexing. The short-term objectives of the project include: 1) Development of a sparse channel estimation technique to reduce the receiver complexity for MIMO-OFDM systems; 2) Investigation of a novel transmit scheme and thereby a  comprehensive semi-blind channel estimator for 4G systems that is free of signal perturbation errors; 3) Development of a hardware prototype with embedded software for a MIMO-OFDM system employing the new channel estimator; and 4) Innovation of the current LTE standard to enhance the system performance of 4G systems. 

    We will first conduct a perturbation analysis of existing blind channel estimation techniques, and thereby propose new transmit schemes for the cancellation of perturbation error in the receiver. We will investigate both time-domain and frequency-domain estimation methods as well as sparse channel estimation technique considering the sparsity nature of wireless channels. The research results will be exploited by the industrial partners Nortel and WiTel Technologies, Ottawa, for further commercialization. The project will contribute to the growth of new products and services coming up with 4G systems and networks, and is well matched to the priority of both supporting companies. The research will also involve rich scholarly activities with direct relevance to the training of graduate students at Concordia University.

"The main objective of this proposal is to introduce a next-generation overlay network that lies between the applications and the underlying heterogenous substrate networks.  This overlay understands the performance requirements specific to each application, and optimizes them by managing and allocating various types of network resources. The overlay acts as the glue that holds the different substrate networks together and presents a transparent interface to the applications. It also functions as an intelligent optimizing network managing layer which takes specifications from applications and optimally delivers services to satisfy the differing requirements.



To achieve such an objective, first an accurate mathematical model of the overlay network residing on top of heterogeneous substrates (wired, wireless mobile, wireless sensor) will be developed.  Then, the model identification must be obtained, in a decentralized manner.

reduce the cost while improving the accuracy and reliability of the navigation system through multisensory data

fusion and algorithm enhancement. The system will consist of a low-cost IMU, GPS receiver, digital video

provide precise position, orientation and velocity of UGV while the GPS will update the inertial system to

correct abbe errors and the camera will collect the images as well as feedback the extracted features to update

the inertial system. Thus, the integrated image-aided GPS/IMU navigation solution will provide sufficient

redundant measurements to determine the direct geo-referencing parameters and enhance the system reliability.

"The objective of the proposed research is to develop a new simulation based tether handling technology to enhance the stability and controllability of low-tension tether systems used in the space, aeronautics, marine engineering, among others. The tether is the single load path between the control point and the rest of system. It responds to external loads by adapting its equilibrium geometry to carry the loads by tension. As a result, a tether becomes unstable and consequently the tether system becomes uncontrollable when tether tension approaches zero. The new handling system will control the tether system based on the computer prediction of tether dynamics in addition to the conventional tether tension feedback control that does not work well in the low-tension range. Most existing tether models suffer from certain limitations such as singularity arising from zero tension, high frequency oscillations due to stiffness mismatch between membrane and bending modes after the bending stiffness is included to alleviate the singularity, numerical inaccuracies resulting from large 3D rotations in the conventional finite element (FE) methods, and numerical singularity from Euler's angles. The applicant will develop a generic tether model to address these shortcomings by devising a new adaptive tether finite element using (i) variable order shape functions based on tension magnitude and (ii) a new global position vector finite element formulation. The resulting equations of motion of tethers will be treated using the modified generalized-alpha method to achieve high numerical accuracy and stability. Based on the new tether model and handling technology, the applicant will develop a nano-satellite end-of-mission deorbitor using an electrodynamic tether. Both numerical studies, using the new element and tether handling technology, and experimental investigations, using instrumented tethers, photogrammetry and digital imaging techniques, will be conducted. The work will train HQPs, add a new FE method to our knowledge, and develop a new tether handling technology leading to the development of tether systems in the space propellantless propulsion, deorbit and repositioning devices, and in the aerial-tether pickup and delivery system in aerospace.

"Limitation of radio spectrum has been a major hurdle in meeting the increasing demand for mobile multimedia communication services. However, a large portion of licensed radio spectrum is not used efficiently. This project is to investigate and develop control algorithms and protocols for efficient radio resource allocation and quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning to secondary users in a wireless network, where the instantaneous spectrum unused by licensed primary users can be properly identified via cognitive radio technologies. By modeling the instantaneous radio resource availability as a random process, we will study three fundamental issues in resource allocation to the secondary users: 1) medium access control, which specifies how each user contends for and shares available resources with its neighboring users; 2) link-layer statistical channel modeling and call admission control, which is essential to facilitate the development of spectrum sharing rules; 3) distributed and dynamic routing for end-to-end QoS provisioning. The research will create new ideas and generate new knowledge for efficient radio resource allocation and effective QoS provisioning in the spectrum agile wireless networks. The novelty and significance lie in three aspects: 1) Resource allocation based on cognitive radios is just at its embryonic stage. QoS support to the secondary users poses significant technical challenges due to the random nature of resource availability; 2) The statistical channel modeling and analysis such as traffic arrival and service processes will provide more insights on how the networks behave under distributed control and will help to develop more efficient and effective network control mechanisms than simulation and/or measurement based approaches; 3) As distributed network control is mainly based on limited or even inconsistent network state information, the modeling and analysis is much more complex than those for networks with centralized control, especially when the network topology, resource availability, and traffic load change dynamically with user mobility and multimedia traffic. The research will contribute to open up a broad range of innovative applications for economical ubiquitous communication services to mobile users.

"Many flows in industrial equipment, whether in a nuclear reactor, in a jet engine or in a simple piping system, are complex and often involve velocity fluctuations at high frequencies. In many cases, these velocity fluctuations produce unfavorable effects, such as energy losses, reduced process efficiency, unacceptably high noise levels, or excessive vibrations which may cause fatigue failure. In order to enhance the performance of the equipment involved, without compromising their safe operation, it is necessary to investigate and optimize their flow characteristics. The requested Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) system is a non-intrusive flow measurement tool that can measure two velocity components without disturbing the flow field, especially when measuring unstable thin shear layers or wall boundary layers. LDV can provide reliable measurements in these situations even when the optical access to the measurement location is very limited. The requested LDV system is a versatile flow measurement tool and can be used in a wide range of research and development projects, including challenging high speed unsteady flows exhibiting high frequency fluctuations. The requested instrument will be used by the graduate students of at least five research groups working on various steady and unsteady flow projects, which are relevant to Canadian industry and the economy.

"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) fuels the microbial activity that drives elemental cycles and represents the largest active pool of carbon in the aquatic environment. Climate and watershed models predict significant changes in DOM transport from boreal watersheds that will have large implications for freshwater and marine ecosystems. Streams are the primary location for elemental cycling within watersheds but are also the most impacted locality within watersheds. Land use trends are currently causing increases in the solar radiation and nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, reaching streams. Nutrients are known to impact how microorganisms and solar light process DOM in the aquatic environment yet the impact of elevated nutrient levels on stream DOM cycling remains poorly understood. The proposed research program will focus on three main questions: (1) How does the source and composition of boreal stream DOM vary among different boreal watershed types?; (2) What effect do elevated nutrient concentrations have on microbial and light-mediated processing of boreal stream DOM?; and (3) How can elevated nutrient concentrations impact composition and function of microbial communities in boreal streams?

      The proposed research will be conducted using three pairs of boreal streams in Newfoundland, representing a gradient of nutrient enrichment. Use of Newfoundland streams will allow for the assessment of impacts typical of other Canadian boreal watersheds such as sewage, agricultural and forestry practices.  Unlike many other populated Canadian boreal regions, it will be possible to establish control streams in proximity to impacted streams due to the small basin size and lack of nitrogen deposition characteristic of Newfoundland watersheds. In addition to the characterization of the study streams, field and laboratory experiments will be used to assess the combined influence of nutrients and light-mediated processes on DOM cycling in boreal streams. This research will provide needed information critical to government planners, industry, environmentalists and scientists interested in preservation and management as well as study of water resources.

"Due to their low absorption in water, acoustic waves are frequently used for remote sensing of various oceanographic variables, bottom sediment classification, ocean bathymetry, fish stock assessment, underwater acoustic communication, navigation and positioning. Most of these applications require good understanding of underwater acoustic channels and sophisticated algorithms for signal compression, transmission and reception. Acoustic transmissions in highly reverberant, time-varying underwater channels often require an adaptive receiver combined with adaptive acoustic beam forming and tracking.  This is particularly relevant in shallow water transmissions.  Efficient acoustic ray tracing algorithms are needed for precise acoustic navigation and multi-beam acoustic bathymetry.  The large amounts of data associated with acoustic sensing require efficient compression for transmission or storage.  Any practical design of acoustic sensing systems must address these problems. The proposed research will recognize all these problems but it will concentrate on novel acoustic methods for precise navigation and positioning of underwater platforms such as bottom crawlers and various underwater vehicles. Such platforms are more and more frequently used for ocean research, bottom inspection and in ocean observing system such as planned by Neptune Canada program and several others. New methods for transmission and signal processing will be developed to achieve precisions not attainable by presently available systems. Specific applications to be addressed include also measurements of plate movements where required precision is in order of millimeters over distances in order of kilometers. Achieving such an extraordinary accuracy require new approaches to such measurements. Another area of research will concentrate on new methods for bottom characterization and classification using depth sounders and side-looking sonars. The mapping of bottom type and its topography is important for fisheries, fish stock assessment and other area of ocean exploration.

"The round goby has become a dominant species in the Great Lakes at sites that have been historically popular and profitable for recreational fishing of sport fish. This invasion threatens the multi-million dollar recreational fishing industry, and has impacted the survival of indigenous fish. This damage will continue to spread with the expansion of round goby populations to more inland waters and rivers.  We propose to protect the breeding grounds of sport and indigenous fish by developing a targeted approach for biological control of the round goby in specific sensitive locations, by developing a multisensory strategy with pheromones and vocalizations, for attracting female round gobies into traps.  The proposed research will identify the chemical structure of a pheromone released in the urine of nesting males for attracting females, will define the dispersal of this pheromone by nesting males, and will assess the efficacy of combining the dispersal of this pheromone with calls emitted by nesting males for luring females. This research will be carried out by a group of experienced chemists and biologists, with consulting input and collaboration from international experts and in partnership with the Ontario Ministry on Natural Resources (OMNR).","A multi-sensory approach to targeted management strategies for the round goby (neogobius melanostomus)",Environment,CANADA,CANADA,"Animal biology"
"Fish rely on olfaction for many facets of life - predator avoidance, reproduction, feeding and even parental care.  Odour concentrations, as low as the picomolar range, are able to generate dramatic behavioural changes. Although great strides have been made towards understanding the olfactory system, basic questions regarding its organization and function remain unanswered. Our longterm goals are to understand the organization and development of functionally distinct subsets of the olfactory pathway in vertebrates that live entirely in an aquatic environment, and how these sub-systems arose during evolution.  Consistent with this idea, we will focus on subpopulations of olfactory sensory neurons, and the accessory olfactory organ, an anatomically linked nasal structure with possible chemosensory properties in the lamprey, a jawless (agnathan) fish of ancient origin that is a sister group to the gnathostomes.  We will test the hypotheses that these cells 1) possess distinct ultrastructural, functional, biochemical and receptor properties, 2) transmit synaptic information in spatially distinct glomerular territories in the olfactory bulb.  Lastly, we will take an activity- based mRNA histological approach for investigating the development of an olfactory pathway that carries information associated with a specific olfactory behaviour. In addition to providing information for the fisheries and aquaculture industry regarding fish olfactory capabilities and development, this research on fish serves as an significant model for understanding the function and evolution of the olfactory system. Understanding the neuroanatomy, composition, function and development of the cellular subpopulations within the olfactory pathway, will lay a foundation for future studies into unraveling the mechanisms of olfactory sensory input on complex behavioural responses.

"The integrated microsystems of the future will become significantly more complex and heterogeneous. To realize their sensing, computing and wireless communication functions, they will employ microelectronics substrate and embedded software, along with microfluidics, MEMS and emerging technologies. Even now, the fraction of first-time-correct microelectronic devices has been drastically reduced from just a few years ago - the staggering complexity, compounded with the time-to-market pressures, has made the time-consuming task of pre-silicon verification increasingly unfeasible. Robust and scalable solutions are therefore needed to help in salvaging and improving the integrated system usability, following the incomplete pre-manufacture verification. 



Failures discovered after manufacturing integrated microsystems are increasingly caused by interactions of multiple blocks, possibly implemented by different technologies. The new techniques are needed to facilitate post-fabrication verification, the detection and locating of design errors, and eventually their correction. The proposed research program will investigate debugging and the design for debugging, i.e., techniques that facilitate discovering and locating faults, together with finding suitable means for their correction, especially in the realm of post-fabrication integrated microsystems debug. Since only the holistic approach will suffice for heterogeneity and complexity reasons, this research program includes a rich set of sub-projects, building on our recent advances in relevant verification and fault detection schemes for targeted implementation technologies and system-level techniques. The specific subprojects include the use of assertion-based techniques for debugging, in addition to the debug techniques for arithmetic circuits, mixed-signal systems, and transaction-level modeling, as well as the exploratory techniques for the emerging technologies

"Computer networks, and in particular hosting server farms, have become very complex systems, and the requirement for 24/7 service requires fast correction of any network and server failures. Correcting network and server failures is a time-consuming, knowledge-intensive process that requires in-depth knowledge of the network setup and the relevant monitoring tools. System administrators need the ability to diagnose the problem from any information available (trouble tickets, diagnostic reports, log file data), in order to identify and perform quickly the required corrective actions. In practice, network and web hosting server system administrators accumulate experience over time, but documenting their experience for others is time consuming and therefore impractical. It is estimated that most of the troubleshooting time is spent on two steps of the troubleshooting process, (1) Identification of the root cause, and (2) Planning the resolution. The cost savings to a typical ISP company that employs thousands of technical support staff will be in the tens of millions of dollars if a solution can be found to reduce the troubleshooting time by 30%. The objective of the NetPal-2 project is to develop a second-generation troubleshooting assistant that: (1) automatically extracts and saves into a system-specific knowledge base the relevant information to problem cases already resolved; (2) retrieves cases from the knowledge base that are potentially relevant to an unresolved problem, thereby helping the system administrator to identify causes and locate a solution much faster than looking up generic Web resources.","Information extraction for retrieval in dynamic system administration","Information and communication services",CANADA,CANADA,"Expert systems"

"Aviation is currently responsible for an estimated 3.5% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions, and its share is growing the fastest. The International Panel on Climate Change projects that aviation will produce up to 15% of man-made global warming by 2050. A second problem facing civil aviation is that its energy consumption is forecast to grow. It is clear that the present situation is not sustainable and that environmental considerations are central to the future of the aviation industry.



The purpose of the proposed research is to examine new aircraft configurations and technologes with significantly reduced drag. This will lead to reduced emissions and fuel consumption. Aerodynamic concepts under consideration include innovative configurations, such as flying wings, ring wings, box wings, and notched wings, mission adaptive wings, and active flow control.



The methodology to be applied to this investigation is the Newton-Krylov discrete-adjoint algorithm for aerodynamic optimization pioneered by the applicant. This algorithm permits the aircraft configuration to be determined that minimizes a prescribed objective while satisfying specified constraints including the relevant equations governing compressible fluid flow. Using this optimizer, optimized versions of each of the aerodynamic concepts under study can be characterized, evaluated, and compared.



The results of this investigation are expected to contribute toward the design of future environmentally-friendly aircraft.

"There are numerous unresolved problems in actuarial, engineering, life and other sciences dealing with sequences, functions, and their functionals. The proposed research program has two intertwined objectives: A) creating and exploring appropriate statistical models and improving upon existing ones, and B) producing appropriate statistical inferential theories and testing them in simulation studies as well as on real data. Specific problems of my particular interest concern such areas as: 1) modeling ageing processes in biological, electrical, and mechanical systems with applications in actuarial, life, and engineering sciences, 2) statistical reliability engineering with the aim at determining and investigating optimal burn-in, wear-out, replacement policies, 3) developing tests for distinguishing deterministic noises from random ones with applications in medical sciences and telecommunications.

"Arid mixed siliciclastic-carbonate coastal and marginal marine depositional systems are characterized by a high degree of complexity and internal heterogeneity.  As well as complex interfingering of lithologies reflecting environmental shifts related to shoreline migration, tectonic subsidence and eustatic sea-level rise or fall these successions are strongly influenced by transient phenomena such as discharge of ephemeral rivers (and concomitant construction of short-lived deltaic successions) or the migration of aeolian dunes of various sizes through a coastal plain dominated by sabkhas and shore-parallel lagoons. 

   The objectives of this proposal will be to add to the understanding of mixed clastic-carbonate arid coastal and marginal marine depositional systems using Upper Triassic (Lower to Middle Carnian) rocks in western Canada as a case study. These strata, included within the Charlie Lake Formation (subsurface and outcrop) consist of a thick, complexly interbedded succession of carbonate, siliciclastic and evaporite strata.  A lack of regionally extensive chronostratigraphically or biostratigraphically useful horizons has rendered facies models difficult and accurate regional correlations impossible.  Few studies have been published through the study interval and those that have been published have relied heavily on lithostratigraphic techniques.  Thus regional correlations contain numerous internal diachroneities and consequently detailed regional facies modeling has not been attempted.

   This study is intended to fill these gaps using core and outcrop analyses, major-element, trace-element and isotope geochemistry, heavy mineral analyses, conodont biostratigraphy in western locales where the study interval interfingers with marine strata and detailed regional-scale mapping.  Research objectives will include: (1) Development and utilization of geochemical correlation techniques to subdivide the study interval into a series of synchronous time slices (2) Comparison of Triassic outcrop and subsurface successions to modern analogues; (3) construction of detailed sedimentological models for Triassic successions.

"Perceived quality is concerned with the quality of software as experienced by its users. The perceived quality of a software which crashes often, requires frequent battery recharges, and has limited space to store personal files is low since the user experience is a disappointing one.  Users of mobile devices are more sensitive to the perceived quality of mobile software due to the tight integration of mobile devices in our daily lives.



The goal of this research project is to explore the concept of perceived quality in an industrial setting using real-life field data gathered from complex software. We want to improve the perceived quality of mobile software. Instead of performing traditional small-scale user studies, we will mine field data collected from thousands of mobile devices. The work will centre around three dimensions: 1) Software Reliability: Using field data, we will build models to measure the perceived quality of software and guide project planning activities by providing estimates of the optimal length for field testing periods and by helping developers rapidly fix bugs. 2) Software Footprint: We will develop a framework to automatically reduce the overall footprint of mobile software throughout its lifetime. 3) Battery Life: We will develop a framework to track the energy consumption of mobile software over time and refactor the code to help improve the battery life. 



The results of this research will permit companies, like RIM, to better understand, closely monitor and drastically improve the perceived quality of their mobile software deployed on millions of devices. The results will also help international and Canadian mobile carriers, such as Rogers, Bell Mobility and Telus, in understanding the perceived quality of their device offerings and ensuring that their subscribers have a high quality user experience. This project will train 12 HQP (3 Ph.D., 4 Master's, 2 Post-doctoral and 3 undergraduate students) in an important area of software engineering for mobile software.","Improving the Perceived Quality of Mobile Software","Information systems and technology",CANADA,CANADA,"Software engineering"
"Rapid changes to business requirements are forcing organizations to reengineer their business processes and to evolve their supporting software systems. The agility and evolvability of software are becoming increasingly important at each stage of the software life cycle.  If such characteristics are ignored, software systems will deteriorate and will eventually be abandoned and rewritten with large costs to their owning organization. The objective of our research is to support the understanding, development and evolution of long lived software systems. Specifically, our research aims to maintain the consistency of business processes and source code, and to develop agile software systems that are responsive to changing business processes. Moreover, our research will create tools and techniques to ensure that the quality of software systems remains at satisfactory levels. 



To ease the evolution of software systems, we recover business processes from the implementation of software systems, and provide a high-level functional view for developers to understand complex software systems. To ensure that business changes can be easily propagated to the code, we will automate the generation of business applications based on business process specifications. We capture implicit design information embedded in business process specifications, and use Model Driven Development techniques to represent the recovered design information in an intermediate design model (i.e., UML model). Once new changes occur in business processes, the UML model is updated automatically and tweaked manually, if needed, to re-generate new code. Finally we provide a systematic approach to preserve specific software quality attributes while changes in functionality are introduced. Our research ensures the successful evolution of large complex software systems by preventing the decline of their quality and ensuring that they are adaptive to their changing environment. We expect that this research will graduate 3 Ph.D. students and 6 M.Sc students in the next five years.","Business oriented software understanding, development and evolution","Computer software",CANADA,CANADA,"Software engineering"

"The proposed research program aims at developing an automated framework for optimized model generation for stress analysis in tunneling applications incorporating geologic features. Modeling and design involving geomaterials often has to accommodate for our lack of knowledge or data mainly due to cost, particularly for three-dimensional modeling. In the design of tunnels, geologic features not only complicate excavation and add to the cost, but if not modeled properly, can substantially influence the results and could potentially lead to incorrect design. Their influence is mainly due to differing material properties (e.g. an intrusive dyke with 3x higher stiffness attracting stress). Unfortunately, in current stress analysis practice, geology is often omitted due to lack of modeling tools and time constraints. The proposed framework will enable the proper inclusion of geologic features in stress analysis using a selective algorithm to filter out features not affecting the result. Model generation will require input parameters, such as tunnel geometry and geologic features (e.g. orientation and spacing of joints, etc.). A high-resolution surface mesh of the tunnel(s) will be automatically generated from the input data using meshing algorithms and resolution of intersections of tunnels will be implemented along with inclusion of geologic features. The model will be optimized to reduce mesh density and eliminate geologic features based on a region of interest (ROI) concept pioneered by the applicant. The generated mesh will have good quality at the ROI and reduced density at 'far away' regions. From this mesh, a volume mesh can be created with 3D meshing algorithms useful for FEM analysis. The next step of the research program will involve testing the framework using practical scenarios. What sets the proposed research program apart from the existing ones is: inclusion of geologic features in the tunnel model for stress analysis and the ability to automatically generate optimized meshes based on ROI to reduce computation time while maintaining solution accuracy considering the effect of geologic features. The framework will enable the design of safer and more economical tunnels and underground infrastructure in Canada and around the world.","Optimized stress analysis model generation for tunneling applications incorporating geology","Modelling and mathematical simulation of natural processes",CANADA,CANADA,"Geotechnical engineering (including engineering geology)"

"A short description of this proposal might be ""Design for Extreme Environments"" via application of ""Geometry in Mechanics"". Such environments include unusual ones like the inside of a living artery or a hot steel convertor and the more ordinary fast, precise measurement and material handling systems that must operate in hostile surroundings. Context is the applicant's participation in the NSERC/McGill Design Engineering Chair's team. Problems are solved using geometric methods, often in spaces of dimension greater than 3. Geometric considerations arise because, for example, inserting a coronary stent requires it to bend while, like a road culvert, it must be radially stiff. The perforation pattern of this tube is a design feature that should be related to certain curves on its surface called geodesics. These curves, or fair approximations thereof, appear in roadway structures, e.g., elements of a tubular bridge on a curve. In contrast, here high bending strength is required. Finally these (possibly) shortest curves-on-the-""dough-nut"" appear in planning the path that a simple robot arm, with only elbow and wrist joints, must follow to stay as close as possible to a straight line. This joint arrangement does not permit it to do so exactly. Try to do it with a pointer in your hand and your upper arm immobile. If the latter appears frivolous and without practical importance it was nevertheless useful for motion programming of a miniature, automated robotic excavator used to prepare sewers for relining in places like Vienna and Calcutta. The dough-nut  is called a torus. This and surfaces of 2nd degree, called quadrics, play the major geometric role in the theoretical part of the proposed research. Properties of quadrics are used, for example, to reveal awkwardness in robots, called ""singularity"", where it should not exist; that is in robots with a more than sufficient number of joints designed specifically to avoid such embarassment. It is proposed to extend these techniques to other types of manupulators and robotic systems and also to the camera-aided precision metrology of cylindrical and similarly shaped parts.

"The objective of the proposal is to develop and test a highly efficient and highly reliable new prototype transmission for wind power generation. The Wind Power industry is over $20 billion per year in size and growing at over 25% per year; by the end of 2008 there were 121,188 MW of wind turbines installed worldwide generating 1.5% of the world's energy. A substantial amount of development has gone into the production of variable-speed wind turbine technology. This is due to the improved energy production and thus an increased efficiency by adapting the rotor speed to match the wind speed. However, even the most advanced variable speed wind turbines can only achieve an efficiency of 85% and most current wind turbines use gear

transmission and face a significant reliability issue. The Synchronized Segmentally Interchanging Pulley Transmission System (SSIPTS) is an innovative new transmission technology invented by Vicicog, a start-up company in Toronto. It is the world's first transmission to combine the high efficiency of a fully toothed driving mechanism and the high reliability of a

continuous morphing pulley without using gears and clutches. It has been demonstrated that the major performance characteristics of SSIPTS rival and surpass those of the latest variable-speed transmissions. The computer-controlled transmission is maximally efficient at all speed ratios, shifts under load and offers a very wide range of ratios. SSIPT will offer approximately 10% more energy to be produced in wind turbines and up to 20% more than fixed speed wind turbines.

The proposed project team will be composed of the PI, two co-applicants, a number of HQP for training, and three supporting organizations: Vicicog, Magenn Power Inc., and Wind Energy Institute of Canada. The potential production and manufacture of SSIPTS will produce a significant number of high-paying jobs in the alternative energy industry. The use of SSIPTs in wind power generation will provide more power with existing resources, thereby better utilizing the capacity of the grid and allowing more renewable power.","Development of a novel, highly efficient variable transmission for wind power generation","Alternative energy resources",CANADA,CANADA,"Mechanical engineering"
"The aim of this proposal is to expand my research on conventional automotive belt drive systems to advanced automotive belt drive systems for micro hybrid vehicles. Micro hybrid vehicles are a type of hybrid vehicles closest to the conventional vehicles. In micro hybrid vehicles, an advanced accessory belt drive system will be introduced in which the alternator is replaced by a new electric device called Integrated Starter-Generator (ISG). ISG functions as both a starter and a generator, replacing the two separate units in conventional vehicles. A car equipped with ISG will automatically shut off the engine during idling, at traffic lights for example, and quickly restart the engine as the acceleration pedal is depressed. It is estimated that the use of ISG can potentially cut fuel consumption by up to 10% and reduce CO2 emissions by up to 15%. 

     The advanced accessory belt drive system of micro hybrid vehicles is usually named belt-driven integrated starter-generator (B-ISG) system. Since year 2000, over 30 patents have been generated on B-ISG. However, B-ISG faces a major technical challenge yet to be solved: A very high belt tension is generated when ISG functions as a starter, resulting in quick belt wear and much shortened belt life. 

     To overcome the problem B-ISG is facing, the proposed research aims to conduct dynamic analysis and design optimization of B-ISG systems. The objectives of the research are: 1) Establish a dynamic model to model the auto start/stop process of B-ISG systems. 2) Solve the dynamic model to simulate the auto start/stop process. 3) Perform design optimization for designing a new tensioner. 4) Build the new tensioner and test its function in experiments. 

     The proposed research will contribute to the knowledge in the area of modeling, analysis, and multi-objective optimization of B-ISG systems. Furthermore, the work will benefit Canadian automotive industry and will help in saving energy, reducing CO2 emission, and creating cleaner air. Finally, the research will contribute to training of HQP with highly desired skills for Canadian automotive industry.

"My research in recent years has been in the development of the theory of computation and specification of abstract data types.  I have done this largely in collaboration with Prof. John Tucker (Swansea) in many publications.



We have developed a number of models for computation on abstract algebras (structures),

especially the real numbers, which are an example of topological (or ""continuous"") data. In such structures we are guided by Hadamard's principle, which says (roughly) that computability implies continuity. To apply this to our basic operations, we must work with partial algebras, including (e.g.) partial equality and order operations on the reals.



We have started to investigate analog computation on such structures.  Briefly, digital computing systems work with algorithms, and analog systems work with simulation.  We want to give a sound mathematical foundation for analog systems, and hybrid (analog + digital) systems, and investigate conditions for the existence, uniqueness and stability of such systems.  The practical use for this is clear in our society, where digital and hybrid systems are becoming increasingly common.

The principal obstacle in achieving these two different but interdependent objectives is that current software engineering processes do not provide adequate methods and tools to achieve security goals. Security loopholes often leave the system vulnerable to malicious attacks and abuses. In this research, various methods and tools will be developed with a view to building and monitoring intrusion-aware software systems.

    Available software specification languages are not completely suitable for specifying security related aspects of software, while attack languages are not useful for software development. The use of two different languages for software specification and security specification involves a number of unwanted and complicated issues. This research will focus on the factors related to the limitations of the existing intrusion scenario description mechanisms and the corresponding software monitors and design ways to overcome them.  A specification method will be proposed which can be used to specify both normal operational behavior and the behavior of the target when it is under known attacks. Tools will be built for intrusion scenario description, automatic signature generation from the scenarios, and automatic detection of intrusions by comparing the run-time behavior of the software with the signatures. Intrusions exploit vulnerabilities which often exist in multiple modules of software. To address this cross-cutting issue, we will extend our aspect-oriented intrusion-aware software development framework for component-based systems. An aspect-oriented intrusion monitoring and response technique will be proposed considering components as black boxes. The resulting components will be intrusion-aware with the ability to monitor intrusions automatically. 

    One of the unique aspects of this research proposal is to provide a balanced training facility for five graduate students which will include both software engineering and security engineering principles for building secure software products.

"Centrifugal slurry pumps are widely used in Canada's oil sands industry to move mixtures of solids and liquids. They play the critical role of providing and maintaining flow of slurries for bitumen separation. They are also extensively used in mining, ore processing, waste treatment, cement production, and other industries. Wear of slurry pump impellers and other wetted components, caused by abrasive and erosive solid particles, is a main cause that reduces efficiency and the useful life of pumps. This leads to unscheduled outages of slurry pumps which cost oil sand companies millions of dollars each year. On-line assessment of the wear status of wetted components in slurry pumps will generate significant cost savings for slurry pump operators.

This project represents a collaborative effort between the University of Alberta and Syncrude Research Centre. Its objective is to develop methods for accurate assessment and measurement of the wear status of impellers and other wetted components in centrifugal slurry pumps. The results will be useful for on-line condition based operation and maintenance of field slurry pumps. The results to be developed from this project will benefit companies using slurry pumps and as a result the Canadian economy. The research results to be generated will enrich the world knowledge base on slurry pumps. Highly qualified personnel will be trained for the Canadian industry.

"Planetary gearboxes are widely used in Canada's oil sands industry. They are also used in helicopters, heavy-duty trucks, and other large-scale machinery. Unscheduled outages of planetary gearboxes have major economic consequences. On-line assessment of the health condition of planetary gearboxes will generate significant cost savings for these industries. 



This project represents a collaborative research effort between the University of Alberta and Syncrude Research Centre. Its objective is to develop methods for detection of early faults that may develop in key components of planetary gearboxes. A planetary gearbox test rig will be set up. Sacrificial components of the gearbox will be machined to mimic common damage modes experienced in field operations. Data and signals to be collected from the test rig may include output torque, rotational speed, bearing temperature, acoustic signals, and multi-axis vibration signals. The collected data will be analyzed with statistical methods and advanced signal processing techniques. Models will be constructed to reflect the relationship between the damage status and the collected data and certain parameters extracted from the data.



The results to be developed from this project will be used in on-line condition based operation and maintenance of planetary gearboxes to prevent unexpected breakdowns. They will benefit companies using planetary gearboxes and as a result the Canadian economy. They will also enrich the world knowledge base on gearboxes. Highly qualified personnel will be trained for the Canadian industry.

"Most of the research and development work which aims to produce advanced steels with high-strength and ductility has focused on the strengthening of a ductile matrix.  Less work has been devoted to the approach of making strong (but brittle) material more ductile.  This research takes a hierarchal approach to the development of such materials.  To start, the structure-property relations for the base material are developed with special emphasis on understanding the microstructure at the nano-scale.  Composition gradients are then introduced at the micron and millimeter scale in order to spatially vary the properties of the material in such a way as to further optimize the properties.  These graded materials could then be incorporated into micro-strut materials with architectures at the millimeter and centimeter scale.  These architectured materials present an additional opportunity to optimize the properties of the material leading to combinations of properties that are not possible with any conventional material.

"Elevated trace metal concentrations are a common occurrence in surface soils around many industrial and mining sites, in shooting ranges, and in sites that have received repeated applications of biosolids. Although stringent regulations have helped reduce such contamination, legacy contaminants remain a significant threat to human and ecological health. Current remediation technologies, such as soil excavation, are costly and may not be applicable on a field scale. Additionally, approaches that employ phosphorus (P) to stabilize metals such as lead (Pb) may present environmental risk (eutrophication) to surface waters. The overall objective of this proposed research program is to identify critical mechanisms regulating the performance of in situ remediation approaches - phytoremediation and chemical stabilization - for Pb-contaminated soils. An understanding of the processes and mechanisms will allow improvement of the technologies to speed up cleanup while minimizing leaching to groundwater. A series of greenhouse, laboratory, and field experiments will be performed to (i) characterize the efficacy of Indian mustard and corn for phytoremediation of Pb-contaminated sites; (ii) understand the change in contaminant dynamics when EDTA is applied to enhance Pb phytoextraction in calcareous soils; (iii) study the interaction of Pb with fertilizer or compost P in the presence of EDTA; (iv) determine Pb and P fractionation in contaminated soils treated with EDTA and/or manure phosphorus; (v) identify the dominant processes influencing the mobility of EDTA-bound Pb in the root zone; (vi) characterize the basic mechanisms controlling chemical stabilization of Pb using P derived from fertilizer or compost, and (vii) identify the mechanisms regulating Pb and phosphorus leaching in P-treated Pb-contaminated soils. Results from the research will enhance our understanding of the fundamental processes involved in these remediation approaches and help improve their field perfomance. Models formulated from the research will also assist government and industry in the site-specific assessment of potential success and risks of the remediation strategies based on site characteristics.

"The proposed program will target innovations in the chemistry and physics of materials in the presence of external fields. We seek to capitalize on our recent discovery of lead-free zero stress optic glasses, by extending our research into the wavelength dependence of the stress optic effect, and into sulfide glasses in addition to oxide glasses. These two advances will lead to families of broad-band zero stress optic glasses, suitable for both the visible and infrared spectral regions. Such glasses will find application in image reproduction, including some television designs, and also glasses used in fiber-optic commuication. We will also develop new magnetic resonance methodology for studying materials in the presence of electric fields, and use it to probe the degradation pathways of materials used in lithium ion batteries. The result of this phase of the work is anticipated to be the discovery of new materials for longer-life rechargeable batteries. Finally, we will develop improved computational methods for the calculation of magnetic resonance observables, which will be applicable to all the materials studied here. These methods will be implemented in an open-source framework, thus giving access to a diverse range of materials scientists seeking to use magnetic resonance methods.

"Intensive farming of fast-growing hybrid poplars can be improved by selecting drought-resistant clones for the areas exposed to periodic drought conditions. This task requires the use of predictive tests. During the first part of this research project, we conducted controlled-environment studies to determine which drought resistance characteristics of poplar could be suitable as part of the drought resistance screening protocols for poplars. The proposed second part of the project extends these findings to the field conditions. In the proposed research, we will use a field drip irrigation system to provide hybrid Populus clones with different levels of soil moisture. We will use the clones that have been tested in the controlled-environment study to confirm and validate the results of controlled-environment studies and to determine whether the identified resistance characteristics are present under more complex natural field conditions. The main objective of this research is to identify the morphological and physiological attributes of drought resistant hybrid Populus clones that would make these clones suitable for plantations in water limited environments such as those present in north-central Alberta and across the Prairies.

"Oil sands mining causes disturbance to boreal ecosystems as it involves complete removal and reconstruction of landforms. The impacts of this development on the environment are mitigated through reclamation, reforestation and soils closure activities. In many of the oil sands reclamation areas, soil pH is more alkaline than soil pH measured in comparable soil horizons found in undisturbed boreal forests in the region . Potential differences in pH between reclamation soils compared with that of undisturbed forest soils can profoundly affect forest productivity. These differences in the initial soil pH on reclamation sites may be particularly significant for some of the acid-loving forest understory plant species. Understanding the effects of high soil pH on plants is essential before undertaking steps aimed at addressing these concerns in reclaimed soils. In the proposed project, we will examine the effects of root zone pH on the physiology, growth and survival of plant species native to the boreal forest of northeastern Alberta. In the controlled-environment experiments, we will examine growth and physiological responses of pH-tolerant and pH-sensitive plants to understand their limits and mechanisms of pH tolerance.  We will examine the hypotheses that: 1) Boreal plants vary in their sensitivity to high soil pH, ) Negative effects of high pH on plants are aggravated by high calcium concentrations, 3) Alkalinity tolerance of plants is related to their ability to control Ca uptake, 4) Increasing soil P and Fe availability alleviates effects of alkalinity, and 5) Resistance of plants to high soil pH increases with age. The proposed study will generate knowledge required to develop protocols for the reclamation of oil sand areas that are affected by high soil pH.

"The project focuses on the role of root and leaf water channel proteins (aquaporins) in regulating water relations of plants. Our research has established strong links between environmental signals including light, temperature, and various chemical and physical soil properties and water transport in plants. We have also demonstrated that the mycorrhizal associations have direct and indirect effects on water flow properties in plants. In the proposed project, we will continue this research to gain understanding of the mechanisms controlling water transport in plants and their interactions with the environmental factors.  The proposed project consists of five studies. Study 1 will examine the role of light-induced proton gradients in regulating root and leaf water transport; study 2 will use molecular and whole plant physiology approaches to examine the role of aquaporins in leaf water transport; study 3 will investigate water flow properties of adventitious roots which are produced in response to flooding; study 4 will examine how membrane lipid composition affects cell water transport; and study 5 will determine water flow responses of ectomycorrhizal and ectendomycorrhizal plants. The principal long-term objective of the proposed project is to develop knowledge required to understand the mechanisms of water flow regulation in plants. The short-term objectives are to: 1) determine the role of aquaporins in controlling root and leaf hydraulic conductivity, 2) investigate effects of light on hydraulic properties of roots and leaves, 3)  examine the properties of water transport in adventitious roots of tamarack seedlings and the role of adventitious roots in water relations of flooded plants, 4) determine the role of membrane lipids in regulating the function of root aquaporins, and 5) examine the mechanisms controlling root water flow in mycorrhizal plants.
