"Proteomics relies very heavily on mass spectrometry to determine the sequence of amino acids in at least a short segment of a protein.  Usually the protein is broken down by an enzyme (trypsin) and the sequences of the amino acid residues in some of the product peptides are determined by their fragmentation in a mass spectrometry.  The mechanisms by which peptides fragment are still not very well understood.  We are addressing this problem in several ways.  We are examining details of the mechanisms by which protonated peptides (the usual target) fragment; this frequently necessitates looking at the even simpler building blocks of peptides, the amino acids.  We are also expanding fragmentation studies into two different classes of ions, (1) radical cations of peptides formed in electrospray mass spectrometry by breaking copper ion / peptide complexes, and (2) complexes of peptides attached to more highly charged ions like a La3+ ion.  These two classes of ions will give different types of information about the peptides and will help clear up ambiguities in the sequencing information obtained from the protnated peptide studies. Throughout all this experimental work Density Functional Theory calculations will be used to determine the structures of intermediates and to determine the barriers to their interconversion.

One of the most important (and difficult) reactions in organic synthesis is forming a carbon-carbon single bond between two saturated carbon atoms.  An organometalic compound that catalyzes a wide variety of carbon-carbon coupling reactions has recently been discovered here at York.  We are using computational chemistry to understand why this catalyst is so efficient and will use our findings to help us design even better catalysts.

"An important goal of research, driving the development of new materials, is the discovery of the physical mechanisms behind novel phenomena.  In many interesting materials, the collective properties of the electrons and their spins (intrinsic angular momentum vectors associated to the electron) vary greatly from the expectations of single particle physics, leading to observable emergent properties.  Such materials are referred to as strongly correlated materials, as, if the spin at one site points in a particular direction, the direction of the spin at a neighbouring site is highly correlated with the first.  Materials where the electrostatic interactions energetically favour the alignment of neighbouring spins are referred to as ferromagnets (like the bar magnet on a fridge).  Antiferromagnets are more common, and favour the antialignment of neighbouring spins.  If a lattice of spins is made of equilateral triangles or tetrahedra, and the bonds of the lattice have antiferromagnetic interactions, the spins cannot all antialign with their neighbours.  This leads to there being many equal energy or degenerate states and the spin structure doesn't know which arrangement to choose.  Materials with magnetic lattices built of corner-shared triangles and tetrahedra are referred to as geometrically frustrated materials.  The goal of this program is to explain and predict exotic properties of new materials which may arise due to the frustration of the magnetic interactions between spins, particularly those which may arise due to quantum effects.  This work is motivated by the discovery of new low spin (and therefore highly quantum mechanical) magnetically frustrated materials,  both metallic and insulating.  This work will consider magnetic systems which do not order to very low temperatures and ask what properties of such materials are generic to all frustrated lattices.    This program will investigate the possibility that some materials that have not yet been classified as frustrated materials, yet have also not been understood theoretically, may additionally fall into this class of materials.  These issues will be addressed through the use of a variety of numerical and analytic theoretical techniques.

"This proposal describes scientific problems whose behaviour is stochastic in nature and which require probabilistic and statistical tools for their analysis.  One important class is concerned with modeling and nuclear safety in CANDU reactors.  As these reactors age, safety margins decrease and it becomes necessary to adopt statistical methods to determine whether they meet operating licenses under current conditions of whether they need to be de-rated.  De-rating a reactor means it must operated at reduced power with an enormous loss of revenue.  Previously, it was adequate to carry out deterministic safety analyses or limit of envelope computations that took into account extreme operating conditions.  Such methods are unduly unrealistic and need to be replaced with statistical methods. This proposal continues collaboration with scientists and engineers at Ontario Power Generation.  One of the most significant previous contributions by the applicant in which a rigorous statistical approach benefited the industry involved the feeder pipes at Pickering Nuclear Generating Station A where he showed that additional large sampling was unnecessary, thus shortening the time and lost revenue while the reactor units were down, for submission of restart letters to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.   Potential future directions of research include best estimate and uncertainty analysis to neutron overpower protection and channel/bundle power compliance. A statistical approach provides benefits in providing better margins to the license limits while adhering to safety standards.  Another class of problems concerns partition distributions in population genetics and ecology.  These distributions describe the observed variation in present day population.  Understanding these distributions sheds light on the underlying evolutionary process.  The applicant has developed a framework in which many of these partitions can be derived from one unifying principle and hopes to use this approach to develop tools for making inferences about the evolutionary forces which have led to the observed diversity of species and genetic variation.

"Several topics in theoretical and computational physics will be pursued:



1) Multiple ionization of simple molecules by ion impact, and by superintense laser irradiation. The ionization of water molecules by ion or laser bombardment plays an important role in radiation medicine. Our previous work on ionization of atoms will be extended to this more complicated case. It will lead to more accurate theoretical results which will be compared with experiments on molecule fragmentation.



2) Radiative decays of anti-hydrogen in magnetic and electric fields using semiclassical methods.  This mostly numerical study will help to understand the capture of anti-hydrogen in a magnetic trap, which will be implemented at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) in the near future by the ATRAP collaboration. These experiments are conducted to explore the symmetry in nature between matter and anti-matter. The calculations will help experimentalists to form anti-hydrogen in such levels that losses will be minimized.



3) Ionization and electron-positron pair production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We have developed a

new computational method for the Dirac equation in extreme relativistic situations. The work is related to the breakdown of the normal vacuum state: in uranium-uranium collisions at the Coulomb barrier electron-positron pairs are created. With the current upgrade of the GSI accelerator and storage ring (Darmstadt, Germany) new measurements of such collisions will be undertaken. Our calculations will serve to explain these data.

"Synthetic materials such as plastics are increasingly used inside the body.  Examples include implants such as prosthetics, catheters, and sutures.  Attachment of proteins is one of the first events that occur when these materials are placed in contact with bodily fluids and tissues.  It is vital to understand this attachment process since it ultimately determines the short- and long-term biocompatibility of the materials.  Many proteins change their shape upon contact with a synthetic surface in response to an environment that is very different from that of a solution. The shape of a protein is just as important as its chemical composition for performing structural or chemical functions in the body.  Therefore, when the nature of the implant surface causes attached proteins to change their shape, this alters subsequent events such as the attachment of other proteins or cells.  In order to control these processes, biomedical engineers seek materials such as polymers that have two sets of design constraints: one for the bulk of the material (that governs its strength, rigidity, and toxicity), and one for the surface of the material (that controls its interaction with proteins).  It has previously been difficult to probe the molecular-level details of the interaction between proteins and solid surfaces due to the requirement of accessing the buried solid-solution interface, and distinguishing between molecules on the surface and those in solution.  Recent advances in nonlinear optical spectroscopy have enabled the selective probing of interfacial molecules with an unprecedented level of structural detail.  Our lab will use state-of-the-art nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy to understand the surface structure of polymers and the structure of model peptides attached to these polymer surfaces.  The experiments will be complemented with computer modelling in order to arrive at a deeper understanding of protein-surface interactions.  We anticipate that the results of our research will be of direct interest to biomaterial design, the development of biosensors, and bio-separation and purification technologies.  In addition, the pursuit of this multi-disciplinary research creates many unique training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and other researchers.

"The Canadian Light Source (CLS) is one of the largest scientific projects in Canada and one of the most advanced synchrotron facilities in the world. The CLS produces extremely brilliant light, ranging from infrared light to high energy X-rays, that is used by researchers to probe the chemical structure of matter, down to the atomic level. This fundamental knowledge has applications in a wide variety of fields that are important to Canadian science and industrial research and development, including environmental science, natural resources and energy, materials science, health and life science, and information and communications technology. 



Using the CLS, researchers from universities and companies from across Canada and around the world are discovering new ways to manage mine wastes, identify weak spots in viruses that could be exploited by future drugs to treat diseases, build better motor oils, develop new products using nanomaterials and better understand how carbon can be captured and stored.  Research projects being developed at the CLS will shed light on the study and treatment of diseases in humans and animals, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease.



The CLS is committed to being the world leader in synchrotron industrial utilization. Research time utilized by industry will lead to Canadian industries being competitive in sectors such as environmental remediation, natural resource utilization, energy, pharmaceuticals, novel materials and nanotechnology.

"Highly distributed 'swarm' systems have the attraction to engineers that the whole exceeds the sum of the parts, that is, that the collective behaviour of the swarm is more complex and useful than that of each member of the swarm.  Studies have shown that simple rules followed by the individual lead to the complex 'societies' demonstrated in the natural world by, for example, ants and termites. In addition to spatial distribution, such approaches provide robustness, redundancy, and in particular parallel information processing. In the engineering context, mass production of electronic and opto-electronic devices has made systems comprising hundreds or thousands of individual elements both technically and economically feasible. This project builds on the extensive experience of York University's Vision Sensor Research (VISOR) Laboratory in distributed systems, in particular the acquisition and integrated processing of image information. Examples include space-based meta-arrays of sensors and the current work on electronic compound eyes and other distributed sensor systems. 



The goal of the proposed project is to develop and implement on-chip, sensor-level and system-level techniques for dynamic optimisation of system resource allocation based on the scene and other dynamically changing environmental influences. Resources here refer to sensor selection, resolution, speed, data reduction and analysis, as well as communication methods, bandwidth, etc. To do this we will exploit concepts from natural systems, such as flocks of birds, schools of fish, or termite colonies. In particular, we need to understand how to develop simple behavioural rules for individual sensors which lead to a desired collective behaviour of the system that are practical for engineering applications. The  proposed research will develop technology valuable for ultra-low-power imaging systems-on-chip, biomedical applications, nano- and pico-satellites, and portable consumer products.

"Modern object-oriented programming languages, Java and C# in particular, rely on a technology called 'just-in-time' (JIT) compilation to achieve good performance. JIT compilers generate machine code while the program executes. However a JIT compiler cannot afford to spend much time on extensive analysis of the program to optimize it fully, and thus to improve performance further.



The proposed research involves collecting a minimal amount of information while the program runs to identify 'hot' parts of the program, where a large proportion of the execution time is spent. In the light of this information, selected portions of the program can be recompiled. In the recompiled portions, computations have been moved out of hot parts of the program and moved to cold parts, thus improving the program's overall performance.","Computer software","Information and communication services","Computer Science","Horspool, Nigel","RGPIN ","Computer systems software","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",3-5
"Why is tape sticky?  Why do we slip on ice?  These are some everyday questions that can be answered by considering the fundamental nature of surface or interfacial interactions. To try and address these questions, we need to consider the nature of the chemical forces  at the junction between two interfaces.  Can we quantify them?  And can we modify the chemistry of a surface so that it will bind only to some molecules but not to others? The questions noted above are fundamental ones, but there are also a number of practical problems which can be addressed by answering these questions.  For example, how we can separate or purify mixtures of several molecules leading, for example, to the development of better drugs.  What are the forces that control the adsorption of enzymes or proteins on the surface of a detection device.  Answering this will allow development of analytical devices for quick screening for cancer or other diseases. Another application is the adsorption of trace contaminants to soils, leading to better environmental remediation techniques.



To try to understand these problems, I will make use chemical force measurements to directly probe interactions between small molecules and surfaces.  In a chemical force measurement, or chemical force spectrometry (CFS), we make use of a very small cantilever (similar to a teeter-totter but mounted at one end, instead of at the middle) with a pyramid-shaped tip mounted at the bottom of the free end.  This tip is coated, or derivatized, with the molecule under investigation.  We then bring the tip into contact with the surface and, by measuring the deflection of the cantilever, we measure the amount of force required to pull the cantilever and surface apart.  Backed up by various electron and photon-based measurements of molecules at surfaces, we will use the CFS method to address the problems noted above.  Training of five graduate students will equip them for careers in academia and industry.

"The hourly weather data that are usually used as indicators of environmental loadings on building envelopes are not always sufficient. Studies show that accuracy of the heat-air-moisture (HAM) transfer simulations and calculated wind driven rain (WDR) amounts and intensities results are, to a large extent, determined by the time resolution of the meteorological input data (Blocken et al, 2007; Blocken and Carmeliet, 2007). It is highly recommended that high-resolution data (e.g. 10-min data) be used for more accurate simulation results. In establishing her new research program at Ryerson that coincides with the development of Ryerson's newly approved Masters of Building Science (starting September 2008), this applicant is planning to include such data in studying HAM performance and WRD distribution on building envelopes, and further investigate such hypothesis. Specifically, this project will study the influence of microclimatic environmental loads that exists in urban downtown environment in the City of Toronto on hygrothermal performance of various exterior wall assemblies in real time, over at least 3 seasons, combining experimentation and simulation. It will compare results of HAM performance simulation based on high-resolution data acquired on site, simulation based on hourly data from the airport weather station and experimentation data. This project will provide training and research work for 7 Masters of Building Science students over 5 years, as well as opportunities for participation for several undergraduate students. The results of this research will contribute to expanding the knowledge on accuracy and appropriateness of weather data used in building performance simulation, a research question raised among researchers in Canada and worldwide.

"In order to understand the signals that cause T cells (a type of white blood cell) to develop distinct functions involved in defense against disease-causing microbes and cancer, as well as the prevention of autoimmune diseases, we need to be able to determine the type and amount of chemical messengers (called cytokines) that are involved in this process. We also need to be able to measure the growth of T cells as they respond to these signals. Such measurements can be accurately and quickly obtained using a microplate reader that detects changes in light absorbance (color) caused by growing cells or cytokines in the presence of the appropriate indicator system. This method replaces other approaches that require much more expensive instruments or the use of radioactive materials. 



The instrument requested is a state-of-the-art Asys Expert Plus Microplate Reader plus the necessary MikroWin 2000 computer software to analyze our data, and a Laserjet printer to generate hard copies of our results. This new instrument will replace an ancient second-hand Bio-tek microplate autoreader that no longer functions and can not be repaired because parts are no longer available. 



A new microplate reader is essential for the continued success of the applicant's NSERC-funded research into the role of a unique cell surface structure (Thy-1) and related molecules in the development of the appropriate immune response against disease-causing microorganisms and cancer, as well as preventing the development of autoimmune diseases. Since these studies depend heavily on our capacity to measure cytokine production and T cell growth in a timely and accurate manner, the requested microplate reader will have a tremendous positive impact on our ability to meet our research goals.

"Mountains are reminders that Earth is dynamic and that tremendous forces operate within.  During mountain-building (orogenesis), heat and mass are transferred in the crust by magmas and the best evidence of this in the mountainous region of western Canada, the Cordillera, are widespread plutonic rocks.  The research proposed here will test hypotheses on the styles and timeframes of pluton construction and for selected plutons (Guichon Creek and Hogem Batholiths, B.C.) will determine how much magma was produced and for how long.  Results will bear directly on regional scale Cordilleran tectonics and because plutons are the building blocks of mountains, this research will ""take the pulse"" of orogenesis.

       Research activities center on three foci: (i) emplacement style and the spatial and temporal extent of magma chambers, and the consequences on our understanding of the processes that generate magmas and change their compositions; (ii) unraveling the record of magmatic evolution preserved as compositional variation within single mineral grains and melt inclusions; (iii) developing a robust conceptual and numerical approach to thermodynamic modeling of plutonic systems.  Testing hypotheses and developing innovative models will be done by integrating field work, whole-rock geochemistry, in situ mineral and melt compositions, and by linking observations and interpretations gained at the outcrop scale to those at the micro-scale.

       Research results will significantly contribute to the re-evaluation of traditional concepts of plutonism that is now occurring in this discipline.  Results also will be used by industry to develop and hone exploration models for metallic ore deposits.  Creating links in this regard, and transferring knowledge from the education to the mining sector, supports the NSERC mission to build the Canadian economy.  Also, consistent with the mission of NSERC to train highly qualified personnel, this research program will support the training of a group of students, both graduate and undergraduate, and a postdoctoral fellow.

"Next generation wireless/mobile communications systems are being developed with the vision of heterogeneity in which a mobile user/device will be able to connect to multiple wireless networks such as cellular wireless, WiFi, and WiMAX networks simultaneously. Heterogeneous wireless systems will achieve efficient wireless resource utilization, seamless handoff, and global mobility to enable mobile users to connect to the Internet in a seamless manner. Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSA) is a new design paradigm to enhance the radio spectrum usage efficiency in next generation heterogeneous wireless access networks. Different from traditional static spectrum allocation, in DSA, radio spectrum can be dynamically coordinated and allocated to radio access networks (RANs) and mobile users through the use of cognitive radio (CR) technique. Protocol engineering and architecture design for broadband heterogeneous wireless access systems based on DSA is an emerging research area. The major challenge here is to manage radio spectrum and other wireless resources efficiently from the service providers' point of view for maximum capacity and improved return on investment while satisfying the requirements for the different wireless services and applications. The objective of the proposed research is to address the problem of modeling, analysis, design, and optimization of the major architecture and protocol components to address these research issues in a dynamic spectrum sharing-based heterogeneous wireless access network. The results of the proposed research will have significant scientific as well as technological impact.



The importance of the proposed research stems from: (i) the growing demand for low-cost ubiquitous wireless broadband services, (ii) the need to produce the expertise and the skilled graduates to transfer the relevant technologies to the Canadian telecom/IT industry for our economic advantage, and (iii) the goal to enhance Canada's position as a world leader in wireless/mobile networking research.

"Steel-concrete composite construction is very often adopted in high-rise buildings, long-span bridges and roof structures. Its advantages include speed and ease of construction, inherent ductility, and structural efficiency with large strength-to-weight ratios as well as large flexural rigidities against instability and serviceability problems. Hence, advances in steel-concrete composite structures are important to practicing engineers/designers/organizations especially with an increase demand for infrastructural developments in Canada over the next decade.



This research program is aimed at developing high performance steel skinned-concrete composite structural elements and building systems for built infrastructures. The study will particularly aim at the development of a novel form of composite framed shear wall system (CFSWS) for buildings. The proposed shear wall system will consist of a traditional steel beam-column frame and a novel form of sandwich wall made of double skins of profiled steel sheeting with an infill of concrete. This research project is very relevant to Canada as it can lead to the development of an elegant and a robust structural system that satisfies the structural (strength, ductility, shock absorbing and lightness), the constructional (feasible, simple, fast and pre-cast option) and the economic (associated with better durability and service life in addition to  lower construction time and labour cost) requirements. Extensive experimental investigation on CFSWS and its components will be conducted under in-plane monotonic, cyclic and impact shear loading conditions to evaluate their performance.  Experimental investigations will be supplemented by finite element modeling and design oriented & Code based analyses to develop design guidelines for such structural system.

"One of the central themes of my current research is the synergy of combinatorics, graph theory, and numerical linear algebra to explore new and innovative ways of formulating and solving important  scientific  problems. With the technological advances in high performance computing systems a major challenge confronted by researchers is concerned with the design of effective algorithmic tools and frameworks that exploit the problem structure and the computing system architecture to solve increasingly complex and extremely large scientific problems. Accurate climate modeling code such as ``Community Climate System Model'', for example, belongs to the so called ``petascale simulation'' applications. One of the necessary computational components of  such a simulation model  is concerned with  the efficient calculation of ``sensitivities'' of a large number of output parameters with respect to a small subset of model inputs. Exploiting  a priori known information such as sparsity and structure of the underlying problem is crucial for designing effective  algorithms for such applications. Additionally, the architectural complexity of modern high performance computing systems  pose considerable 

difficulty in effective software implementation of such innovative algorithms.

"Oxidative stress is a common response to different abiotic and biotic stresses such as heat, cold, high-light, drought, osmotic shock, wounding, UV-B radiation, ozone, aluminum and pathogens. Thus improving tolerance to this stress will enhance plant fitness by increasing their ability to tolerate a variety of stresses. To achieve this goal, we will:



I) Identify the regulatory factors involved in oxidative stress responses in wheat. In particular, we will identify wheat transcription factors that can activate genes associated with oxidative stress tolerance. One family of genes (containing motifs called zinc fingers) was proposed to play a role in oxidative stress tolerance in other species. This family will be characterized in wheat to identify the homologs of ZAT10 and ZAT12 zinc fingers. The promoter region regulating the expression of oxidative stress responsive genes will be isolated to determine if zinc fingers and/or other transcription factors are able to activate their transcription.



II) Determine the function of selected key genes in transgenic Arabidopsis and wheat. Among these genes, some are involved in the detoxification of harmful oxidative molecules (e.g glutathione S-transferase); while others such as transcription factors (wheat homologs of ZAT10 and ZAT12) and regulatory enzymes (fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase) are involved in the regulation of key metabolic pathways that participate in the control of oxidative stress. The effect of these genes on molecular responses, sugar mobilization and energy homeostasis will be evaluated.



Understanding the regulatory mechanisms involved in oxidative stress tolerance will lead to the development of appropriate strategies to prepare the plant to confront other stresses and thus improve plant fitness.

"How do galaxies form? How do planets form? Where do we come form? Are we really made of stardust? Although these questions deal with subjects of vastly different scales (i.e., the galactic, planetary, human, and microscopic scales), they are all linked together through two common themes: origins and stars. 

The origin of the stars themselves, however, is arguably the single most important topic that underlies these and other fundamental astrophysical questions. This is because as stars form they acquire the characteristics that will determine how they will live their life, affect their galactic neighbourhood, and ultimately die. The problem of understanding the different processes and phases of star formation is central to obtaining a better and bigger picture of the working of the Galaxy, and the Universe as a whole.

This research program proposes to attack the problem of star formation by studying molecular clouds. These aggregates of dust and gas are not only the birthplace of stars, but also constitute one the main components of our Galaxy. Because of their fundamental position in the time line that spans the life of stars, a study of molecular clouds is also a study of star formation. The program will concentrate on two of the agents and phenomena that are known to inhabit these structures and participate in the star formation process: the interstellar magnetic field and gas turbulence.

This research program will focus mainly on the utilization and the development of new instruments to be designed for, and installed at, premier submillimetre astronomical observatories, to vigorously pursue lines of research essential for the characterization of turbulence and the strength and morphology of the magnetic field in molecular clouds, as well as improving our understanding of its nature, role and importance in the formation of stars.

As a result, this program will within only a few years provide a wealth of new data that will significantly improve our understanding of many aspects of the star formation process.

"When transmitting data, errors can occur due to noise. In binary data, these errors cause the value in a single bit to be changed from 0 to 1 or vice-versa. When using an error-correcting code, we store the data according to a specific pattern before transmitting it. After transmission, this pattern allows us to determine in which bits errors have occurred, and then to correct them. Traditional error-correcting codes, capable of correcting errors such as these, are used in many areas including for satellite transmissions and to store data on compact discs.



Data is not always binary. In fact, data can also be stored in DNA, in which the logical counterpart to a ""bit"" is a ""base"" with four possible values. Also, other types of errors may occur: in biological applications, it is useful to correct insertions and deletions of symbols as well as substitutions. The related area of DNA computing uses the DNA itself to perform computations; using error-correcting codes improves reliability.



Error-correcting codes do not exist for all possible sets of parameters. Thus if we wish to use a code of a certain type we may have to perform a search to determine if it exists and its structure. This is called a combinatorial search. Such searches typically have a huge search space, and thus the use of computers is generally a necessity. Combinatorial searches may be applied to many different types of structures, including weighing matrices and designs. Another example of their use is protein side-chain packing, which involves finding the best arrangement of a given protein; from a Computer Science point of view, this is often represented as another well-known combinatorial structure, a graph.



The primary objectives of my research are to provide answers to the above types of problems, and furthermore to determine appropriate algorithms for use in different types of searches.","Mathematical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Computer Science","Houghten, Sheridan","RGPIN ",Combinatorics,"Pure mathematics","Math�matiques pures",1-5

"My long-term objectives are to determine how habitat loss and degradation affect ecological communities, and how those changes in ecological communities affect ecosystem structure and  function.  I will do this using large-scale experiments and research synthesis techniques.  

In the short-term I will address three questions, 1. Are biotic interactions important in driving population and community dynamics?; 2.  What are the primary causes of global amphibian declines?; 3.  How do roads and road construction affect pond-breeding amphibian communities?

To answer the first question I will use two approaches.  The first involves whole-pond experiments where 6 ponds are split by a large impermeable curtain extending from the surface of the pond to the pond bottom. All amphibian species are excluded from one half of 6 replicate ponds, but allowed access in the other half.  Then we monitor water quality and the abundance of aquatic invertebrates and plants in both halves of the ponds to see if the amphibian communities play an important role in pond dynamics.  The second approach uses publicly available datasets to examine covariance among species in ecological communities.  Using a simple statistical procedure we test for negative covariance among species in natural communities, which we would expect if competition is an important driver of population and community dynamics.

To answer the second question we will use a dataset of more than 1000 amphibian population time series and examine the correlation between amphibian abundance and suspected mechanisms of amphibian decline like UV-B ray exposure and habitat loss and degradation.

To answer the third question we have designed a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) experiment to monitor amphibian populations at ponds near proposed road construction areas, both before and after road construction.  We will compare changes over time in those ponds with changes in similar ponds that are not near road construction sites.

"In this study we will use whole-ecosystem experiments to examine the effects of a common chemical herbicide on aquatic communities. We do this in natural systems where we can explore how fertilizer inputs and predation interact with herbicide effects. Until recently, glyphosate (i.e. RoundUp and Vision), a chemical herbicide that is widely-used to control vegetation in forestry, agriculture, and on military installations, was considered by many to be a relatively benign herbicide.  New research suggests that glyphosate may have greater negative environmental impacts than had previously been suspected. However, the results have been ambiguous, in large part because the experiments were carried out in small artificial systems that cannot capture all of the spatial, temporal and biological heterogeneity present in nature. We have the unique opportunity to establish a set of 36 experimental ponds at CFB Gagetown in southern New Brunswick to determine the effects of glyphosate in natural systems that capture all the complexity found in nature. We will conduct replicated experiments with all ponds separated into two halves by an impermeable curtain and treatments applied to one half while the other half is left untreated as a control. Treatments will include glyphosate at predicted (i.e. worst case scenario) and realistic environmental concentrations, alone and in combination with agricultural fertilizers and natural predators of amphibians. We will examine impacts of these treatments on a variety of aquatic organisms, including phytoplankton, macrophytes, and invertebrates, but the primary emphasis of this work will be on amphibians because of their unique developmental biology, physiology and potential as indicators of environmental stress. We will be testing to see if new glyphosate formulations, alone or in combination with fertilizers and predators, have effects on amphibian gene expression, hormone levels, fecundity, survival, sex ratios, disease prevalence, deformities, abundance and species richness. These results will be used by our partners, the Department of National Defence and Canadian Forest Service to develop watershed management plans.","Agricultural chemicals (fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides)","Manufacturing processes and products","Biology (Saint John)","Houlahan, Jeff","STPGP ",Ecotoxicology,"Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie","2 & 3-3"

"Edges are often characterized by processes with rates that differ from those typical of either type of adjacent ecosystems: higher rates - hyperdynamism; lower rates - hypodynamism. Three types of edge can be identified: an open edge is a recently-formed edge along which no change in forest structure has yet occurred; an edge closes with time as trees bordering the edge produce a denser canopy and as the shrub understory produces a denser foliage; an embedded edge develops with time as shrub and tree species are recruited at progressively greater distances into the adjacent old-field. Because edges differ in their nature, differences in process rates across edges may be more or less apparent. In this proposal, I want to determine how edge type affects the demographic processes of both forest and non-forest plant species. My general hypothesis is that edge effects on population processes depend on the nature of the edge: I suggest that open edges are those where differences in the rates of demographic processes are most significant, differences decreasing as edges become closed or embedded with time. I also propose that, among the different understory functional groups, spring-flowering ephemeral species are those that are less affected by edge type, spatial contrasts along edges in major environmental variables being more moderate in spring than in summer. Because environmental heterogeneity is typically greater across edges than in the 'interior' of either adjacent ecosystem, edges represent ideal systems to test the diversity-production relationship with regard to environmental heterogeneity. As open, closed and embedded edges differ in their characteristics, the significance of environmental heterogeneity for the diversity-production relationship can be tested using different types of edge. I suggest that open edges are those across which environmental heterogeneity is higher, with greater effects on the diversity-production relationship. This research has significant conservation implications as altered population dynamics near edges may lead to greater risks of extinction in highly fragmented landscapes.

"The immobilization of organic and bioorganic molecules on solid surfaces is a central objective in nanotechnology and microarray technologies. Developments in sensors and molecular electronic devices are directly related to advances in immobilization techniques and methodologies for molecular manipulation and control of surface adsorbates. My long-term objective is the development of molecular electronic devices, for use in sensing applications. My initial thrust concerns three important aspects of the chemistry necessary to make this a realizable technology; (i) the development of new approaches for the efficient modification of solid surfaces with organic molecules, (ii) the rigorous characterization of surfaces and investigation of the electrochemical properties of the films, and (iii) the electrochemical manipulation of adsorbates on a highly local level.

Both conducting (Au and Ag) as well as semiconducting (Si) surfaces will be investigated. While most experimental conditions for SAM preparation yield reproducible organic interfaces with specific desirable functionalities that are acceptable for some applications, other fundamental properties need still to be further studied and optimized including corrosion and electrochemical properties. This is intrinsically related to the development of SAMs with lower defects and increased order. On the other hand, the organic modification of oxide-free Si surfaces offering a direct combination of molecular materials and solid-state semiconductor structures and is then an attractive approach toward technologically useful and molecularly tunable thin films.

The idea of this proposal is to use my experience in electron transfer based reactions, electrosynthesis and SAM electrochemistry to develop chemical solutions to the issues of surface derivatization and local manipulation.

"The sulphur amino acid methionine plays critical roles in animal cells as a substrate for protein synthesis (structural, enzymes, hormones), as a methyl donor (neurotransmitter synthesis, DNA stability), and for the synthesis of the amino acid cysteine.  The latter occurs through a pathway called transsulphuration, for which homocysteine acts as an intermediate.  Homocysteine metabolism to cysteine requires the assistance of key nutrients as cofactors for enzymes, including several water soluble vitamins.  When the supply of cofactors is imbalanced, homocysteine metabolism is perturbed.  Much of our knowledge of homocysteine metabolism comes from research examining changes in blood or tissue concentrations in relation to nutrient supply.  While important, they do not provide quantitative data as to how much the synthesis of cysteine is hampered.  This has important consequences, as the goal in supplying the sulphur amino acids is their provision at rates to meet whole body demands.  The current proposal seeks to address this issue by using a whole body model for the measurement of cysteine synthesis through the transsulphuration pathway and to elucidate the specific impacts of varying nutrient supply on this conversion.  Over the course of the granting cycle, the proposed research program will lead to the development of a valid model for the assessment of the quantitative partion of homocysteine metabolism. The novelty of the program lies in the integration of whole body and tissue/cellular specific information, which will lead to the development of a holistic picture of the key factors regulating sulphur amino acid metabolism.

"The motion of an object towards an observer is indicated by the following sources of information (cues): (1) Changes in the absolute disparity of the images in the two eyes and the vergence movements of the eyes that these create. (2) An increase in the relative binocular disparity of the near and far regions of the object (internal disparity). (3) Changing relative binocular disparity between the object and stationary objects. (4) Looming of the image of the object. (5) Motion parallax between the far and near regions of the object. (6) Changes in accommodation. I have designed and built a unique apparatus that allows me to independently control each of the above cues. Two identical image objects (textured surfaces or real 3-D objects) are placed in the two arms of a mirror stereoscope and moved to-and-fro along linear tracts within arm's reach. The image objects fuse to create a stereo object moving towards and away from the observer. Absolute disparity (vergence) is controlled by rotating each track. The internal disparity of the stereo object is controlled by rotating each image object about its mid-vertical axis. Looming is controlled by keeping the image objects at one distance while changing absolute disparity by moving the image objects laterally or relative disparity by rotating them. I can thus change any motion-in-depth cue or any combinations of cues using real objects really moving in depth. It is generally believed that changes in absolute disparity do not create sensations of motion in depth. I have already shown with the new apparatus that this assumption is incorrect. The crucial factor is whether or not there is image looming that contradicts disparity signals. Manipulations of internal disparity over a stationary textured frontal surface are known to affect the perceived distance and shape of the surface. I will use the new apparatus to investigate the distance scaling of internal disparity with real surfaces and 3-D objects moving in depth. Changes in internal disparity are a cue to motion in depth only when the object is assumed to be rigid. I will investigate the role of assumed rigidity by using familiar objects, abstract objects and objects that articulate.

"My research program tries to understand at a molecular level the developmental programs that control the very early stages of development. Specifically, we are interested in early stem cells that have the ability to produce many different cell types within the body. I study this program using a  mouse model and by analyzing differentiation of mouse cells in a tissue culture system. I have identified a gene, called ARS2, which is essential for the survival of these early embryonic cells. ARS2 is present in most multicellular organisms, including plants and animals, and is essential for their development.  I suspect that the function of this gene is very similar in divergent organisms.  I think that the product of this gene is needed for the production of a special class of genetic molecule, called  miRNA, whose job it is to regulate when and where specific developmental programs are initiated. In the absence of this regulation, development cannot proceed and the embryo dies. My research program is aimed at determining whether this hypothesis is correct and at understanding how Ars2 is able to control production of miRNAs by determining protein partners for Ars2 during development.

"In eukaryotes DNA is packaged into a nucleoprotein structure consisting of DNA, histones, and non-histone proteins. The packing of DNA into chromatin is important for the regulation of gene expression and for chromosome stability. Chromatin structure can be regulated by the addition of post-translational modifications to histones, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. However, despite several decades of study, little is known regarding the functional consequences of these histone modifications. The current accepted hypothesis is that histone post-translational modifications serve as ""beacons"" to recruit ""effector"" proteins that modify chromatin structure.  However, to date, few of these effector proteins have been identified. We have recently detected chromatin-binding activity in Yaf9p, a YEATS (Yaf9-ENL-AF9-Taf14-Sas5) domain-containing protein.  Proteins containing YEATS domains are components of multiple chromatin modifying complexes, and we are interested in determining whether these proteins specifically recognize post-translationally modified histones.  Using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches we will characterize the interaction of the YEATS-domain proteins with chromatin in the model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Determining the function of these proteins will enable us to understand how histone modifications can regulate chromatin structure.

"The objective of this proposal is to establish a research program on innovative and unique nano-bonding technologies for direct bonding of materials, discrete components, and devices from seemingly dissimilar technologies in order to create miniaturized Bio-Micro-OptoElectroMechanical Systems (Bio-MOEMS) for health and environmental applications by integrating sensing and imaging systems. System miniaturization is critical for noninvasive imaging of living tissue in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, for example. 

Nano-bonding technologies address the challenges of direct bonding of diverse materials for system miniaturization and cost reduction. The proposed nano-bonding technologies, based on the surface activated bonding method, allow for atomic-level bonding even of dissimilar materials, without applying external pressure, adhesive, or heating. This allows for planar and vertical integration required for the miniaturization of Bio-MOEMS. Also, both electrical and optical connections can be made on the same surface. Furthermore, the treatment of the components before bonding is only at surfaces at room temperature and without the use of chemicals. This preserves delicate components and biological specimens or drugs sealed in the microfluidic components of Bio-MOEMS. 

In this research program, the applicant will research nano-bonding methodologies for high density interconnection using copper/copper bonding and fabricate and demonstrate test structures of light emitting diodes coupled with waveguides and photodetectors, and in microfluidic integrated sensing system. This research program is an enabling factor in the creation of miniaturized Bio-MOEMS, from which Canada will benefit enormously in the strategic field of medical care and environmental applications. The strong participation of students will train highly qualified personnel (HQP) and will promote innovative interdisciplinary research in biomedical and environmental engineering. This will attract talented and experienced researchers and HQP in the world and retain them in Canada.

"My Discovery Grant Program is designed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of experience on neurophysiology and cognitive functions such as memory.  Neurophysiological processes and memory are strongly influenced by a variety of experiences, such as acute stress.  However, definitive links between the effects of experience on particular neurophysiological processes, such as patterns of synaptic plasticity, and memory are lacking.  The specific experiments in the present proposal are designed to determine the effects of one particular experience, that of acute stress, on memory retrieval in rodents.  We have recently developed sensitive behavioral tests that may be used to reliably assess two types of memory, recognition and temporal order memory, in rodents.  When these tests are conducted with different stimuli (spatial information or objects), normal memory performance depends on well understood, dissociable circuits involving a number of brain areas including the hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex.   In an initial series of experiments, the effects of acute stress on memory retrieval in these tests will be examined.  We believe that acute stress will disrupt normal memory retrieval on these tests thereby providing novel information regarding the specific types of memory and neural substrates influenced by acute stress.  In separate electrophysiological experiments, the effects of acute stress on synaptic plasticity in the neural circuits important for performance of these tests will be characterized.  Given the results of previous experiments, acute stress is predicted to enable the induction of a cellular model of synaptic plasticity known as long-term depression in the hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex.  Finally, the effects of a number of highly specific inhibitors known to inhibit long-term depression in other preparations will be used to block the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of acute stress.  An integration of the fundamental behavioral and electrophysiological effects of acute stress on learning and memory will allow theories regarding the neural mechanisms mediating cognition in both normal and challenging circumstances to be developed.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge",Psychology,"Howland, John","RGPIN ","Behavioural neuroscience",Psychology,Psychologie,2-5
"Can quantum computers be realized?  No-one knows, but if they can, the impact

could be enormous and the pay-off huge.  This fact has led leading research

groups around the world to investigate the possibilities of realizing quantum

computers.  This project is a part of this ongoing world-wide research.



If quantum computers can be build, they will make errors, fail frequently, and

require world experts to control for many years to come.  This is so because

the physics is very involved and cutting-edge.  Quantum mechanics is only

barely understood and building computers based on it is a very challenging

task.  It requires a joint effort of mathematicians, physicists, and computer

scientists.

algorithms.  The project aims at overcoming some of the physical challenges in

building quantum computers by applying ideas from computer science, and it aims

at utilizing quantum mechanical effects in constructing algorithms.  The project

aims at make experiments feasible and investigating prospective models.  The

project also aims at increasing our understanding of quantum mechanics and what

"The atomic structure and thermodynamic properties of solid-liquid interfaces play a critical role in such diverse physical processes as the growth of nanowires and the formation of snowflakes.  A more practical metallurgical application is the formation of tree-like structures, known as dendrites, that form rapidly during freezing of an alloy.  The size and shape of dendrites determine, to a large extent, the mechanical properties of cast, welded or brazed parts and it is well known that small changes in the solid-liquid interfacial energy can have profound consequences on dendrite morphology.  The goal of the present work is to develop an understanding of the factors affecting the structure and properties of crystal-melt interfaces.  In particular, the effects of small additions of solute on interface behavior and their role in macroscopic solidification processes will be investigated.    



The technique utilized in the proposed study is molecular dynamics, a computational technique which tracks, as a function of time, the positions of each atom in a large system.  With the advent of fast parallel computational clusters, molecular dynamics simulations applied to solid-liquid systems of millions of atoms can now be achieved and such large scale simulations can provide important insights into the atomic structure, energy and motion of interfaces.

"Canada is among the leading nations in terms of access to broadband services.  However, a 2008 OECD study indicated that many international competitors were eroding this initial lead in broadband penetration.  An important factor in broadband penetration is the availability of suitable access methods.  This research program develops new communications theory, algorithms and prototypes to improve the rates and reliability of indoor broadband optical wireless links.  These links transmit data by modulating and detecting an optical intensity and provide high-rate, cost effective, interference-free indoor communications.  In particular, this research considers indoor optical channels at both visible and infrared wavelengths.  Visible light communication (VLC) channels employ white illumination LEDs whose energy efficiency is at least ten times greater than incandescent bulbs.  An often overlooked feature of white LEDs is there significant modulation bandwidth.  Inexpensive phosphor-based white LEDs have bandwidths in excess of 20MHz while RGB LEDs can have bandwidths in excess of 100MHz.  While others have considered using white LEDs for illumination and communications, there has been little development of rigorous communication theory, algorithms and modulation for these links.  This work will develop spectrally efficient signalling for indoor VLC channels to improve the available data rates focusing on three main approaches (i) optical MIMO techniques, (ii) bandwidth efficient modulation and (iii) equalization methods.  A unique feature is the integration of dimming and colour selection into the modem design problem. In addition, VLC links must be integrated with power-line modems that will deliver data to allow wireless access in a room.  At infrared wavelengths, high-speed dynamic spot diffusing (DSD) infrared communication systems will be investigated.  Estimates indicate that data rates in excess of 1Gbps are possible in such links when imaging receivers are employed.  Capacity maximizing path adaptation and short-length rateless code design will be developed.  This research program will leverage existing hardware in our lab to develop prototypes to validate the developed algorithms.

"Walkerton revealed that drinking water systems in Canada can kill consumers if they are not managed well. While the O'Connor Inquiry has provided Ontario with considerable advice on improving systems and Ontario and other provinces have spent hundreds of millions seeking to improve drinking water safety in Canada, small and remote drinking water systems remain vulnerable in many places. With over 1700 boil water advisories in place as of March 2008 across Canada, there is much improvement needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced a process-focused risk management approach based on water safety plans that is being adopted worldwide, but has not been embraced in Canada. 



The first part of this research program is directed at identifying critical technical and conceptual constraints that interfere with widespread adoption of a functional water safety plan approach, particularly for medium and small drinking water systems in Canada. This research will tackle an identified limitation on the risk assessment component at the heart of water safety plans. A feature that water safety plans promote is to reduce total reliance on treated water monitoring, which is inherently reactive and ineffective for preventing disease outbreaks. A second part of this research is a program that builds on previous work that has shown how ineffective and commonly misunderstood that treated drinking water monitoring is currently among water professionals and public health officials. This research will focus on developing more strategic drinking water quality monitoring to support a preventive risk management approach like that inherent to water safety plans. A third part of this research will focus on the negative aesthetic characteristics of chlorine disinfection. Many consumers object to chlorinous tastes and odours in their drinking water, leading them to seek alternatives that are often expensive and which may be less safe. Despite the pervasive nature of this problem it has received surprising little research attention.

"Snow mould diseases occur on grasses across Canada, and are especially severe in areas of abundant snowfall.

Although excellent control of the diseases can be achieved with fungicides, the cost of applying fungicides

coupled with health and environmental concerns regarding pesticide use have led to investigation of alternative

management approaches. In the past, turfgrass snow molds have been commonly controlled with fungicides

containing mercury and pentachloronitrobenzene. Mercurial fungicides are no longer legal to use for control of

plant diseases in Canada, and persistent and chlorinated chemicals such as pentachloronitrobenzene are under

strict review. Over the past three years of research, we have been examining the use of crucifers and crucifer

by-products such as canola meal for the control of snow molds. These plants contain organic compounds

known as glucosinolates, which are converted to isothiocyanates and organic cyanides as natural plant

protectants (and impart the bitter or potent taste to mustards). Some isothiocyanates (e.g. allyl isothiocyanate)

are volatile and under normal circumstances would be released too quickly to be effective against foliar plant

diseases. However, snow mold disease development has an unique requirement of snow cover, which could

hypothetically also seal in the gaseous isothiocyanates and also reduce their rate of production so that the effect

can be longer lasting over an entire winter. Preliminary trials in the field in the past have been supported by the

Canadian Turfgrass Research Foundation, and these have shown significant suppression of snow molds by

crucifer tissues. More recently, we have begun cooperating with a Canadian company, Nematrol, which

produces a product called Biogreen that has pesticidal properties. The purpose of this research is to develop an

organic control strategy for snow molds based on cruciferous tissues.","Crop management (pest,disease control and breeding)","Agriculture and primary food production","Environmental Sciences, School of","Hsiang, Tom","CRDPJ ","Plant pathology","Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",2-4
"Fungi are of primary importance in organic matter degradation, as well as having major economic significance as agents of diseases of plants and animals, and in industrial fermentation. Fungi generally have the smallest genome sizes among higher eukaryotes.  Consequently, there are more genomes of fungi sequenced than those of animals or plants, with over 45 fungal genomes publicly available to date. The fungal genomes sequenced and the advanced annotation provide a data-rich resource with easy accessibility. I propose to examine the biology and evolution of fungi and some other promising microbial eukaryotes such as slime molds (myxomycota) using genetic data from online sources supplemented by data obtained experimentally in my research program. The purpose of this work is to investigate the evolutionary relationships of fungi, myxomycota and other microbial eukaryotes by searching for new gene sequences with or without annotation from sequenced genomes which may be useful in phylogenetic analyses at various levels, and supplementing the existing sequences and data with wet lab work. These objectives are part of a long term program investigating the evolution and biology of fungi, using the new tools of comparative genomics combined with basic sequencing and sequence analysis techniques. Their eukaryotic nature and small genome sizes make fungi particularly valuable in comparative genomics, and, with the exponentially increasing amounts of sequence data, it is now possible to access and analyse these data to bring forth important discoveries of biological significance.

"Machine learning methods such as neural networks have been introduced to climate research, leading to a better understanding of the nonlinear properties of climate phenomena, such as the El Ni�o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Unfortunately, extra-tropical climate phenomena such the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the Pacific-North American (PNA) teleconnection, extra-tropical ENSO effects, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), with their weak signal-to-noise ratio and/or relatively short data records, pose great difficulties for the current generation of machine learning methods. New robust methods are proposed which should significantly improve on the nonlinear analysis (and in some cases prediction) of these climate phenomena. These robust methods will be useful in analyzing not only observed data, but also the general circulation model (GCM) climate simulations, thereby allowing us to understand not only the nonlinear behaviour of our climate system, but also how the nonlinear behaviour changes under global warming scenarios.

"Accurate characterization of the spatial distribution and dynamic of vegetation canopies is very important for sustainable management of forest resources and protection of our environment.  Advances in remote sensing technologies provide us unbelievable high-quality and high spatial resolution data, which makes it feasible to characterize vegetation canopies at individual stem levels and for tactical management. However, new remote sensing technologies also pose great challenges in developing advanced algorithms for their data processing and analysis. In this study, algorithms and software tools will be developed to accurately identify individual tree species based on the structural, spatial and spectral information derived from lidar data and optical imagery. Innovative technologies and algorithms will also be developed to quantify vegetation growth and health.



The state-of-art remote sensing technologies and algorithms to be developed in this study will provide reliable and timely information about the state of vegetation canopies, which will help governments and foresters make policies and tactical decisions on sustainable forest management. The proposed research will provide Canadian industries (in the remote sensing and forest-related sectors) a distinct and powerful competitive advantage. Through the proposed research, highly qualified personnel will be trained for Canada in geomatics and space science and engineering.

"Accurate characterization of the spatial distribution and dynamic of vegetation canopies is very important for sustainable forest management and environment protection. Remote sensing of vegetation characterization has been one of the important topics since remote sensing was established as a research field. The emergence of a new generation of high-resolution (spatially and spectrally) remote sensing systems in recent years could potentially allow for more accurate and efficient estimation of vegetation characteristics. These technology developments are challenging researchers to develop innovative remote sensing science to interpret information from such data sources. 



The objectives of this research are to exploit the information content presented in the new sensor data and develop novel methodologies to integrate multiple data sources in order to improve vegetation characterization. We propose a physics- and knowledge-based approach. With this method, the high spatial resolution remote sensing data will be first segmented into meaningful objects, such as tree stands or tree stems and the analysis will then be carried out at the object levels. For each object, its spectral, spatial and structural features will be derived from optical imagery and LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data. Based on prior knowledge and results of a global sensitivity study, the canopy parameters that can be retrieved with the highest accuracy from the observed data are estimated first; and the parameters that can be retrieved with lower accuracy are estimated afterwards. In such a progressive approach, the available observed data are intelligently used and integrated in the retrieval process in the form of derived features; as a result, the information needed to determine certain canopy parameters is not masked by other information and natural variability contained in the data. The success of this research will help meet the great challenge currently faced by governments and industry to keep track of the species, condition, functional status, and productivity of our forest resource.

"Spin dynamics link an intriguing triangle formed by interplay between spins, charges, and photons. The past century has witnessed an amazing path along which research activities on this subject have been transformed from the macroscopic to the microscopic level, through the advances in materials science, nanotechnology, and wave physics. Research in this frontier of condensed matter physics is essential for the advancement of information and communication technologies. My long-term research goal is to contribute significantly to this field by studying spin and charge excitations, investigating nonlinear dynamics, and developing novel spintronic devices. The focus of this granting period is to apply innovative experimental tools developed in my lab to investigate the following topics: 



       )	Spin Excitations: understanding spin excitations in ferromagnetic metals and ferromagnetic semiconductors is essential for both magnetic data processing and spintronics applications. My work is designed to apply microwave photovoltage spectroscopy to study spin wave mode evolution in Permalloy (Py) and Fe microstructures, and to investigate spin resonances in nanostructured (Ga,Mn)As quantum wires. Studying these topics will bring considerable insight into spin dynamics in confined systems. 

          )	Nonlinear Spin Dynamics: investigating nonlinear spin dynamics is of strategic importance for integrating spintronic with high-frequency photonic devices, which holds the potential of coherently manipulating spin dynamics in nanostructured materials via intense electromagnetic waves. I will use the spin dynamo, an innovative hybrid device created in my lab, to investigate nonlinear spin dynamics in Py and Fe. 

       )	Spin Hall Effect: this subject is the focus of an exciting frontier of condensed matter research. My program will explore dynamic aspects of this effect in both single crystal Fe film and InGaAs/InAlAs heterostructures. My aim is to position our group at the forefront of this dynamic and rapidly developing field.

"Aiming at real-time simulation and interaction via multi-sensory modalities such as vision and touch, virtual reality (VR) finds many applications including oil and gas exploration. However, adaptation of VR applications has been slow, due to a bottle-neck issue related to intuitive user interaction. This issue becomes more problematic when VR applications run across a computer network for multi-user interaction. We propose to create a hands-free interactive system for manipulating object-oriented information within networked virtual environments. We will develop self-contained desktop VRs and interconnect them to form a networked virtual environment. Each desktop VR will generate 3D stereoscopic displays of the Reservoir Simulation - a software product from the Computer Modelling Group Ltd (CMG). Underpinning the desktop VR will be a hands-free interactive system. This interactive system will utilize camera-based gesture recognition (extracting the user intention of interacting with objects of the 3D displays) and haptics (simulating the sense of touch by providing force feedback to the user's hand). The framework of integrating both gesture recognition and haptics will employ the neural mechanisms that humans use to perform visual perception and visually guided actions. The interactive system will allow multiple users to collaborate their individual interaction (via each desktop VR) across the networked virtual environment. The novelty of the project lies in the integration of gesture recognition and haptics for user interaction; the use of new 3D range cameras for gesture recognition; and the application of the neural mechanisms to address engineering issues. Our previous work confirms that it is achievable to create the hands-free interactive system using current technologies and knowledge. As a novel tool for reservoir simulation, the hands-free interactive system will propel effective oil-related services and economic development for Canada. Its benefit will be allowing the CMG to lead a niche market of reservoir simulation. Its impact will go beyond the oil-related services, serving as a bridge to connect and enhance innovative VR-based technologies for other applications.","Oil, gas and coal","Energy resources","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Hu, Yaoping","STPGP ","Virtual reality and related simulations","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",2-3
"Surgical removal of lung cancer is the treatment of choice. Detailed anatomic information, acquired via surgical planning by reading computed tomographic (CT) images, is crucial to precisely determine whether a cancer lesion is removable and how a surgical procedure preserves maximal lung function.  Modern multi-slice CT scanners have severely taxed the surgeon's ability to handle all information - imagine the workload of reading about 800 CT images of a lung cavity and mapping anatomic structures from them onto the actual lung cavity in three dimensions!  The current clinical practice is to compress multiple high-resolution CT images (typically 0.6 mm thickness) into one standard CT image of 2.5 - 5.0 mm thickness.  This compression results in the loss of detailed and valuable information and, in principle, should be used for better patient care.  Surgical planning based on standard CT images also causes about 10% of patients undergoing invasive procedures only to discover that their lung cancer is not removable.  Based on advanced virtual reality (VR) technologies, our long-term objective is to create VR-planSys - the world's first 3D VR surgical planning system for treating lung cancer.  To fit into an office, VR-planSys will be a self-contained desktop VR system and generate 3D stereoscopic displays of lung cavities from high-resolution CT images.  Underpinning VR-planSys will be advanced haptics (simulating the sense of touch) to enhance intuitive interaction with the 3D displays. Our short-term objectives are to develop: (a) viable segmentation algorithms to automatically extract all anatomic structures from high-resolution CT images of lung cavities; and (b) intuitive human-computer interfaces to correctly integrate visual and haptic information without perceptual illusions.   Our feasibility work confirms that VR-planSys is achievable using current technologies and knowledge.  The initial results demonstrate that viewing 3D displays of lung cavities has significant advantages over reading standard CT images for surgical planning.  VR-planSys will improve patient care; facilitate the development of new surgical procedures; and bridge VR-based surgical planning and simulation for treating other diseases.

"My mathematical research area is abstract harmonic analysis. Many problems in this area can be viewed in terms of spectral analysis and synthesis, a process which has proved to be a significant intellectual pattern in the sciences and arts. As we know, mathematics and each of its parts live and grow on the exchange of ideas between various branches of mathematics and between mathematics and other areas of human activity. Abstract harmonic analysis is no exception to this rule. It utilizes ideas and techniques from other fields to tackle our problems, and in turn, provides other branches of mathematics with some of its own. My proposed research will center around the algebraic, geometric, and topological properties of several important Banach algebras associated with locally compact topological groups. I intend to explore and develop certain natural and unified theories for all groups, even including quantum groups, in an intuitive way to significantly generalize those known results only for some nice groups. It is expected that, through this research, some of the most pursued open questions in abstract harmonic analysis might be resolved and, more importantly, new problems and new ties with other mathematical subjects will emerge.

"Automatic control systems are critical to manufacturing today because they allow for steady process operations, consistent product quality, less waste, and control of emissions. However, most current systems are not designed to optimally handle time-varying operating conditions introduced by time-varying factors such as feedstock changes, product grade changes, demand changes, multi-modes due to process nonlinearities and even operator shift changes. The inability to finely control processes can lead to lower product quality, additional waste, and increased emissions of environmentally undesirable substances. As a result, it is difficult to meet both increased product quality specifications and more stringent environmental regulations - facts of life for industry today - with conventional automation control. We propose to develop a set of tools for improved process control of systems with time-varying characteristics. The approach we will take is based on system identification and optimization of a set of control laws including time invariant as well as time variant control laws for a class of time-varying processes. Our objective is to develop strategies to ensure product quality specifications while minimizing control input energy. Time-varying system identification and process control, particularly for the hybrid or switching systems, are areas of active research.  Our solution will be designed to leverage automation system infrastructure from the existing to a foreseeable 10-year horizon so that it can be implemented in the industrial distributed control systems (DCS) without additional capital cost. This will make it possible to quickly apply the technology to industry.   Improved control reduces variability, allowing processes to be operated closer to their setpoints without violating constraints. This will lead to better product quality and a reduced environmental footprint. Optimizing the control of time-varying operations will make industry more efficient and more competitive in the global marketplace.

"The field of process control monitoring has gained significant progress over the last 20 years. Existing studies have almost exclusively been devoted to continuous-valued or continuum system. In reality, however, many systems or problems may take noncontinuum form or state, such as ""stiction"" vs ""no stiction"" in a control valve. Even for processes with continuum state, one may be interested in only the noncontinuum representation such as ""good"", ""bad"" vs ""optimal"" in control performance monitoring problem. There is therefore a need to consider both continuum and noncontinuum states in process control monitoring. 



The long-term objective of this research is therefore to develop a novel framework based on state estimation for process control monitoring, more specifically, simultaneous process fault detection and control performance monitoring problem. The shorter-term objective is to investigate and develop dynamic estimation methods for both continuum and noncontinuum states and use these methods to solve certain outstanding fault detection and control performance monitoring problems for chemical processes. The moving horizon estimation approach, in particular, will be used for dynamic estimation of continuum and noncontinuum states. Once the new framework is established and algorithms are developed, process control monitoring problems with both continuum and noncontinuum states are solved under the developed framework.



Success of this work implies that many process fault detection and control performance monitoring problems can be cast as state estimation problem and be readily solved. In addition, many process control monitoring problems that appear quite disjoint can be solved in a unified way. This research outcome thus not only provides a theoretical foundation but also facilitates development of computation algorithms for industrial applications under the same computation framework for solving different monitoring problems.

"Following the development of the diagnostic system, a solutions strategy for process improvement needs to be established. Natural questions, such as what to do after a process unit or instrument has been diagnosed to be or potentially to be problematic, have to be answered.    A typical process control system consists of processes, sensors, actuators and controllers. The post-diagnosis solutions  mean that one needs to find timely solutions for each problematic component, for example, to calibrate problematic sensors, develop inferential models  for key variables, quantify the extent of actuator problems, re-identify the problematic process models for controller re-tuning, or determine process problems such as sands built-up in a pipe line or percentage of bitumen wasted in separation  tailings. These problems can all be considered under a post-diagnosis estimation framework. Built upon our previous success in collaborative research and development projects, we are ready to carry forward the work from control system performance monitoring & diagnosis to process control improvement solutions. Under this new initiative, we will establish a novel post-diagnosis solutions strategy through dynamic estimations for process control systems. Specifically, we will endeavour to (1) maximize the use of the existing resources by assessing process data quality for parameter estimation, (2) develop an optimal design strategy for dynamic experiments, and (3) use advanced estimation techniques  to determine key parameters of interest, under closed-loop operations, in the presence of irregularly sampled data and process constraints. Over the last several years, the oil industries have operated their facilities with increasing efficiency and effectiveness by leveraging Process Control and Automation Systems in their operation. This trend is expected to continue in the future with expected higher service factors and utilization. Now is the prime opportune time over the next few years to further leverage Process Control Infrastructures through advanced estimation methodologies, to be ready for the next major economic development.

"In their drive to increase revenues, more service providers are embracing the IMS (IP Multimedia subsystem) service architecture to offer new feature-rich multimedia services. A key component of IMS is the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for managing multimedia sessions.  As the platform for session control, the SIP servers have to respond to user requests quickly enough, especially for real-time type sessions. 

The proposed solution is to adopt an autonomic approach to engineering SIP servers. To achieve the properties of an autonomic system, the proposed solution will include a self-monitoring component that will feed into an embedded performance analysis capability. This combination of self-awareness and analysis will enable near real-time allocations of resources in SIP servers, and in the improvement of the transmission and handling of SIP messages over wireless access networks such as the combination of wireless mesh networks backed by a WiMax network.  

Major Canadian telecom firms (Nortel, Alcatel) adopt the IMS architecture and use SIP to deliver multimedia services.  New small firms, such as NewStep and SIPquest, have products based on SIP.  This research will aim to develop an advanced management solution that, when incorporated into SIP servers, will cut operation costs and make more  efficient use of network resources. Currently Nortel has agreed to serve as the industrial partner and provide both cash and in-kind contrbutions for this proposed project.

We plan to have two Ph.D. students and two Master students working on this project. This will be an excellent opportunity for those students to learn the latest technology in a hot research area and also accumulate experience in dealing with an industrial company.

We believe that the project bennefit Canada in general by helping Canadian companies maintain leadership in next-generation communications technology.

"Air and waste management systems are complicated with many uncertain parameters and their interrelations that present in terms of multiple uncertainties, while the related decision problems are of interactive, dynamic and multiobjective features. These lead to difficulties in clarifying the related vulnerabilities, impacts, risks and liabilities under a variety of system conditions and policy scenarios. Consequently, the objectives of this proposed research is to develop an optimization-based vulnerability and risk analysis approach for air and waste management under multiple uncertainties; this entails (a) analysis of complexities in air and waste management systems, (b) development of inexact optimization techniques under multiple uncertainties, (c) advancement of optimization-based vulnerability and risk analysis approaches, and (d) incorporation of the developed inexact optimization techniques and vulnerability/risk analysis approaches within a general decision-support framework. Advanced inexact optimization methodologies will be developed for addressing various forms of complexities that exist in air and waste management systems. Based on the optimization analysis, a set of vulnerability/risk assessment methods will be further developed for analyzing the comprehensive effects of human interventions on the vulnerability of receptor systems as well as the compound risks caused by multiple environmental concerns. The developed technologies will then be applied to air and waste management within a western Canada context. The proposed study will provide technical and methodological supports for tackling challenges of vulnerability/risk analysis in relation to air and waste management. It will facilitate comprehensive consideration of factors that are related to the decisions of environmental management and risk analysis. Applications of the proposed techniques to Canadian cases will help industries and governments to improve their effectiveness in managing environmental problems.

"The objectives of this research are to develop novel and efficient methods in two areas:

1. Nonparametric Distribution, Quantle and Regression Inference

       Existing inference methods for nonparametric distribution, quantile and regression estimation lack good efficiency on tails of the distribution or have other difficulties. This project will develop novel inference methods, by studying a family of weighted empirical distribution functions and explore the optimal weights that minimize the estimation errors. It will develop non-kernel density, quantile and regression estimation methods by using orthogonal series and L-statistics (noting that the kernel estimation methods have problems of the selection of bandwidth and kernel). The work will compare the new methods with existing methods, and study theoretical efficiency, consistency, rate of convergence, and robustness properties of the resulting methods. It will develop computational methods to compute the exact efficiency and error, and study Monte Carlo simulations to confirm theoretical results.  The new methods will be applied to practical problems.  

2. Inference Methods for Heavy Tailed Distributions

        In recent years, heavy tailed distributions have been applied widely to extreme values, risk analysis and survival analysis, with applications in actuarial science, medical research and network analysis. There are some difficult problems in the inference of heavy tailed distributions. This project will explore innovative nonparametric or semi-parametric inference methods for heavy tailed distributions, and compare them with existing methods. It will study the theoretical and simulation efficiencies, consistency and robustness properties. Also it will apply the above new methods to real world problems, to estimate value-at-risk, survival functions and hazard functions, and waiting time distributions in queueing networks.   

      The work will provide an alternative efficient approach to overcome difficulties in the field, and suggest new ideas for future research. This work will solve real world problems with more accurate solutions.

"Distributed dynamic systems involving many interacting agents widely appear in the socio-economic area, biological systems, and engineering. Many such systems fall into one of the two categories: the agents are driven by individual incentives, or there is a central objective for the agents to cooperatively achieve. Our investigation in these areas will provide insights into understanding many complex phenomena and potentially lead to significant socio-economic and technological benefits.



Within the first category, a typical situation is that each agent has its own incentive and interacts with the population as a whole, and related systems are frequently seen in economics, network resource allocation, biological systems, among others. The primary objective of this research program is the development of low complexity optimization methodologies at the individual agent level and the characterization of the temporal evolution of the overall system. Our results will provide guidelines for designing decentralized solutions in many large-scale decision problems.



We term the second category  as multi-agent coordination, ranging from consensus seeking,  flocking of birds, synchronization of coupled oscillators, distributed computing, to formation of autonomous vehicles. A crucial aspect is that these systems usually operate in an uncertain environment. It is of great interest to study cooperative learning capability of agents with noisy signals and random inter-agent communication failures. The objective of this project is the systematic modelling, algorithms and analysis for the coordination of  networked agents with an emphasis on communication constraints. The research in this area has important implications and applications in coordination of unmanned vehicle teams and data fusion in sensor networks.

"Stem cells are multi-potent because they can develop into the various cell types of the human body, such as red blood cells, nerve cells, skin cells etc. With multi-potency comes the question of choice of cell fate: How do stem cells decide which cell type to commit to? An answer is not only of fundamental biological interest but also of eminent practical importance since we have yet to learn how to efficiently steer stem cells into the desired direction if we are to exploit them for therapy.  Each cell contains the same 25,000 genes but a ""genetic network"" permits only the activation of distinct subsets of genes at a time, generating ""gene expression patterns"" which specify the cell type.  The current picture that a stem cell becomes a red blood cell because a signal, such as the hormone Epo, instructs it how to change its gene expression pattern to that of the red blood cell is oversimplified. Our latest studies in blood cells suggest that every stem cell, even within a clonal cell population, has its own individuality: The stem cell's gene expression fluctuates randomly between various patterns, giving rise to heterogeneity of cells in a clonal population of apparently identical stem cells. Some of these short-lived patterns surprisingly resemble that of one of the stem cell's prospective cell fate as if individual cells independently vacillate between patterns hinting at future cell types. An external signal then only acts ""to push through the final fate decision"". Thus, if in fact only a small fraction of cells responds at a given moment to a specific fate-determining signal this would explain the notorious inefficiency in attempts to convert stem cells into a desired cell type. Our project will apply these new insights from blood stem cells to embryonic stem cells which face a much larger variety of fate choices. Using latest technologies that will allow us to measure gene expression patterns in individual cells we will learn more about the dynamics of gene pattern fluctuations. We will also examine whether variations of chromatin that package the DNA are the source of role in the fluctuations. Understanding the source of stem cell heterogeneity and its link to fate decision is paramount for harnessing the developmental potential of stem cells for therapy.

"Using Google is easy; finding information using Google is another matter. Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in Information Retrieval (IR). However, many challenges remain. First, most Web search engines take a short text query as input and output a ranked list of documents. The retrieval decision is made primarily based on the current query and document collection. For example, a person may use ""IRIX"" to mean Information Retrieval in Context at one time, but IRIX operating systems at another time. It is impossible for the current search engines to distinguish these two cases because the user's search history and context are not considered. Second, IR is, in general, an interactive process. With the current document-centered retrieval paradigm, interactive retrieval is treated as a sequence of independent simple retrieval decision-making steps. However, it has been brought into attention that analysis of task-oriented user sessions provides useful insight into the query behavior of the users. Third, most of present IR systems including general search engines (e.g. Google) and scientific literature search engines (e.g. PubMed) use keywords to query and index documents, which provides little semantic context for the understanding of the user's information needs. Thus, the integration of semantic context according to the user's information need and the user's understanding of the documents in the collection into IR systems will definitely improve the IR performance. However, how to encode and use semantic context evidence for the benefit of retrieval is a difficult problem. 



Our objective is to overcome the limitations of the existing retrieval methods and formally develop a new retrieval paradigm, in which user information and search context are both exploited in the retrieval decision process. In particular, (1) we will develop a personalized theoretical retrieval model for capturing user information and search context; (2) we will develop a novel task-based retrieval model that optimizes the long-term retrieval utility over an entire retrieval session.

"Concerns with green house gas emissions and the uncertainty in the long-term supply of fossil fuels have resulted in renewed interest in nuclear energy as an essential part of the energy mix for the future.  Currently, there is a worldwide effort to develop advanced Generation-IV nuclear reactor technologies with enhanced efficiencies and reduced operating cost.  Canada is taking the lead role in the design of the Supercritical Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR) - one of six reactor designs being considered by the Gen-IV International Forum (GIF). The SCWR design will use supercritical water as coolant in order to achieve high thermodynamic efficiency (i.e., about 45% vs. 33% for current reactors) and plant simplification.  In-core coolant will be contained in pressure tubes, in a similar way as in current CANDU designs.  One of the major challenges for the development of the SCWR is the long-term stability of the materials in contact with the coolant. At present there is no single alloy that can meet all of the performance requirements in terms of corrosion resistance, mechanical properties, and stability under irradiation. Thus, development of suitable coatings for several key coolant-contacting components is needed. The proposed research will investigate coating compositions designed specifically for SCWR operating conditions, and several coating deposition processes. The outcome of this research is expected to generate new knowledge and expertise in coating development and contribute to the design and fabrication of the SCWR.

"Modern gas turbines employ thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) to protect the hot section components from reaching excessive temperature.  The use of TBCs can reduce the temperature on the metal surface by as much as 300�C, thereby allowing for higher gas turbine operating temperatures and achieving increased engine fuel-efficiency and thrust-to-weight ratio while reducing emissions and extending component life.  The demand for ever increasing operating temperature dictates the need for continuous research into new and improved TBCs.  Since TBCs are an integral part of a multiple layered system, they must satisfy many stringent thermal, physical, and mechanical property requirements in order ensure designed component life.  The current and several emerging ceramic materials are not able to satisfy all the requirements.  One of the solutions being proposed to mitigate many of these deficiencies is the modification of the TBC materials through doping (similar to alloying in superalloys).  As such, the objective of the proposed research program is to advance our basic understanding of the relationship between dopant addition and the resulting microstructure and thermal, physical, and mechanical properties of current and emerging thermal barrier coating materials.  The knowledge obtained from this research will provide the foundation on which to engineer the microstructure and optimize the properties through composition selection.  Making use of a systematic approach to evaluate the doping effect, this research will provide a scientific basis on which a much wider variety of dopants may be selected for performance improvement, and expand our material choices beyond the limits of existing material types.",Aerospace,"Transportation systems and services","Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering","Huang, Xiao","RGPIN ","Materials structure, properties and testing","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",1-5

"Given an artin algebra A, one considers the class of finitely generated A-modules, which we denote by mod A.

We can then compute the projective dimension of each such A-module M and we denote this invariant by pd

M. The latter is either finite or infinite. We then define the finitistic dimension of A to be:

fin.dim. A = sup{pd M : M in mod A and pd M is finite}.

In the 60's, Bass conjectured that fin.dim. A is always finite. Since then, this has been shown for very few

classes. We recently showed that algebras with at most three radical layers of infinite projective dimension

satisfy the conjecture, generalizing a result of Green and Huisgen-Zimmermann dating from 1991.

In this research program, we want to study the finitistic dimension from different points of view. We will

consider relative homology, stratifying systems and algebras whose simple modules all have infinite projective

dimension. While our goal is not to show the conjecture in general, we hope that the results and tools we are

developing will help the mathematical community to better master this invariant.

"One of the classic foreland basins of the world is the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British Columbia. As foreland basins are topographic depressions formed by the loading of a craton during elevation of an adjacent mountain range, by analyzing their sedimentary rock layers, the history of mountain formation can be deduced. In western Canada, although general relationships between stratigraphic changes and mountain uplift are established, the detailed correlations of sedimentary features and initial uplift are not well studied and offer significant potential to understand the timing of mountain uplift, stratigraphic changes associated with uplift, and the relationship of uplift to mineral deposit formation (e.g., hydrocarbons). Accordingly, this research aims to unravel the record of initial topographic development of the Rocky Mountains in the Jurassic Period, 146-200 million years ago. Geographic landscape reconstructions illustrating how the region evolved as mountains rose and began contributing significant sediment volumes to the foreland will be produced. 

    Important scientific questions are at the root of the proposed research, including: when exactly did the mountains rise? Did they elevate in pulses or through a slow, gradual process? The area that is now Alberta was bound to the west by an ocean at the start of the Jurassic, but how did the landscape change when the mountains rose? Answers will be sought through sedimentologic and stratigraphic analyses of rock layers exposed in the mountains today and sampled by drilling deep below the surface in the basin. Techniques to be applied include geochronological analyses of detrital zircons, provenance analyses, and process-based sedimentological characterization of units. 

    The research will deduce in unprecedented detail how basins are filled during early stages of development. Insight into how accompanying mountain belts are uplifted and eroded will be a direct outcome with both scientific and industry significance. Vast hydrocarbon resources are present in the rock layers of interest. This research will improve reservoir mapping in the region and provide students with energy industry expertise.","Earth sciences","Advancement of knowledge",Geoscience,"Hubbard, Stephen","RGPIN ",Sedimentology,"Earth science","Sciences de la terre",2-5
"Frictional MEMS: moving at the micro scale



MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) are small devices with feature sizes as small as 1 micron. Motion at the micro scale is dominated by friction: thus many MEMS designs try to avoid friction. If MEMS devices are to be used to their full potential we should use micro-friction to our advantage rather than work against it. The author proposes to develop novel MEMS actuators that utilize friction. This area is important as there is a need for the development of new micro actuators that can produce long ranges of motion, high speed and high output forces. Possible applications include motion stages, micro-robotics, micro-assembly and smart surfaces.



Friction is an integral part of the locomotion of many small organisms and at Dalhousie we have used these principles for bio inspired MEMS devices. Specifically our lab has developed mobile frictional micro-devices that operate in modes inspired by: snails, crabs, cilia and earthworms. Our group has produced frictional micro crawlers that use a novel form of MEMS locomotion similar to snails. We have also demonstrated 2-DOF planar frictional micro-conveyors able to move in X/Y and X/Rotation, using a hybrid snail/crab locomotion.



Future work: 

1) Improving current frictional crawlers to increase speed, range and force. 2) Friction measurements and characterization to improve device reliability/robustness. 3) Researching the locomotion modes of other small scale organisms e.g.: 2D fields of planar cilia, and earthworm inspired peristaltic motors. 

The ultimate goal is to integrate all these aspects into practical frictional micro-systems capable of i) moving long distances ii) applying large forces and iii) doing so reliably and repeatedly.

"My laboratory works with the enzyme, �-galactosidase, from Escherichia coli. This enzyme facilitates the breakdown of lactose (milk sugar). It is involved in lactose intolerance. The enzyme is a model for studies of enzymes that facilitate these types of reactions. The enzyme is also of historical significance as it was the enzyme used in the classical study of genetic regulation. The work in this laboratory is designed to determine how the enzyme functions. The structure of the enzyme is known and we know what amino acids are at the active site (the active site is the area on the enzyme at which the enzyme activity takes place). Amino acids at the active site work together to catalyze the reaction. Some are involved in binding the substrate, some in stabilizing the transition state (the highly active transient intermediate form in the reaction) and some have specific roles in chemical aspects of the  catalytic reaction. In addition, the enzyme also has a function in making a lactose analog (allolactose), an important transient product that induces the genetic machinery (called the lac operon) that causes the formation of enzymes designed to metabolism lactose. We are attempting to discover the role of every important amino acid in this enzyme. We are doing this by a method called ""site specific mutagenesis"" that allows us to substitute specific amino acids. If an amino acid is important, the substitution should affect how well the enzyme binds reactants and forms products. We will also study the way that the protein is folded by a method called ""X-ray crystallography"". �-Galactosidase also requires magnesium to function properly and we will carry out studies to determine the role of the magnesium. In addition there is an important loop region on the enzyme that is needed for full activity. It will be studied in detail. We are also planning to study a �-glucosidase from an organism named Aspergillus niger - mainly we will be determining its structure (by X-ray crystallography). It is involved in cellulose breakdown and thus study of its properties is important.

"The majority of aerospace composite structures are manufactured in autoclaves. Autoclave processing of composites uses primarily pre-impregnated unidirectional fibers or fabrics (prepreg) that are typically cured at 180 degree Celsius and consolidated with 6 atm of pressure. A large database of design allowables for autoclave prepregs is available and accessible to aerospace products designer. This well established process requires very high capital investment for the equipment and tooling costs. Limitation in the size of the components manufactured by autoclave is also a major barrier to the production of integrated large composite aerospace components. Alternatives for autoclave processing must be investigated in order to reduce production costs of aircraft composite structures. This project will address the application of a relatively new class of composite materials using out-of-autoclave (OOA) technologies. The advantages of OOA processes include lower tooling and manufacturing costs. However lower material properties and higher part quality variability limited their application to general aviation and the marine industry. The OOA processing technology addressed in this project is polymer composite vacuum cured optimized prepregs. This material is processed with vacuum pressure to generate the compaction force that will consolidate the composite part. Ovens are used to cure thermally the part on the tool.  The main objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between the performance (thermo-mechanical, quality) and the production costs (tooling, cure cycle, labor) associated with the manufacturing of a composite airframe structure using out-of-autoclave prepreg technologies. To reach this objective, the proposed work follows a building block approach and is organized in three Parts. Part I consists of the identification and characterization of suitable OOA prepregs. Part n involves the manufacturing of representative OOA laminates and Part III focuses on the manufacturing of a representative sub-component.

"To achieve the next generation of aerospace structural materials, new advanced material forms must be investigated.  At the time of their discovery in 1991, carbon nanotubes (CNT) were believed to be the ideal reinforcements for nanocomposites.  Over the last decade, the research on carbon nanotubes synthesis, properties and applications have produced a massive amount of values for the properties of CNT polymer nanocomposites.  Most of the earlier work focused on the direct incorporation of the nanotubes as reinforcements in the resin.  The results show significant variability in properties obtained for thermoplastic and thermoset polymer nanocomposites processed by solution casting, melt mixing, melt fibres, in-situ polymerization and nanotube functionalization.  This is mainly caused by the great difficulty of processing CNT with polymer matrices at CNT volume fraction greater than one percent.  Issues with the poor control of the nanotube dispersion, alignment and interface with the polymer matrix are principally responsible for these disappointing results.  In light of the above, the objective of the proposed research program is to develop and implement an integrated framework that includes modelling, processing and characterization in order to produce high performance CNT polymer nanocomposites for macro scale and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) applications.  New models that predict the physical, mechanical and processing properties of CNT polymer nanocomposites as a function of nanotube dispersion, concentration, purification, functionalization and orientation will be developed.  Innovative manufacturing techniques to produce CNT polymer nanocomposites, hybrid composite laminates and MEMS microactuators will be established.  The integration approach is new as most efforts on CNT nanocomposite development focused on making and testing the nanocomposite without taking processing issues into account.  The proposed work could help develop new nanocomposite manufacturing techniques that will use the full potential of CNT as reinforcements.

"Natural organic matter (NOM) is present in all waters as a natural breakdown product of plant debris, algae, bacteria etc. It has an immense impact on aquatic systems and on drinking water and wastewater treatment. 

The requested funding will be used for the purchase of a unique instrument, the LC/OCD (liquid chromatograph coupled to an organic carbon detector). With this novel tool researchers will be readily able to characterize the different portions of NOM according to their size. LC/OCD is not commonly used and this LC/OCD will be the first in North America. Eight different researchers from the Universities of Waterloo, Toronto and Guelph will benefit from having access to this instrument. 

Drs. Huck and R. Andrews' groups are investigating membrane processes to produce drinking water. The main problem limiting membrane applications is fouling resulting in loss of production. The LC/OCD will allow innovative research such as using biological filtration to remove specific NOM foulants before they reach the membranes. Drs. Parker and Zhou's research focuses on membrane bioreactors and LC/OCD will support optimisation of this advanced wastewater treatment technology. Dr. Legge's group is developing a fluorescence based sensor to detect NOM-based membrane foulants, which would not be possible without confirmation using the LC/OCD. Dr. S. Andrews' research group studies the role of NOM in the identification and minimization of hazardous disinfection by-products. Her research assists in balancing benefits from disinfection with health risks from disinfection by-products. Dr. Hofmann is conducting research on removing micropollutants from drinking water and wastewater using advanced oxidation. Dr. Schiff's group focuses on aquatic biogeochemistry, including the NOM characterisation in Canadian surface waters.

Overall, the LC/OCD will allow engineers and scientists to conduct internationally recognized, leading edge research addressing critical issues in drinking water and wastewater treatment, and in aquatic biogeochemistry.

"When a muscle contracts, an electrical signal can be measured on the skin surface.  This myoelectric signal has been used for many years as a means of controlling the grasping function of an artificial arm.  The research outlined in this proposal will define techniques to extract more information from the surface myoelectric signal. The additional information will then be used in a number of ways.  For the myoelectric control application it will be used to develop more advanced control systems that are capable of controlling additional prosthetic limb functions such as wrist rotation, elbow flexion and multiple hand functions.  A hybrid control system will be developed that uses this information and the information from force and position sensors within the socket of the artificial limb to allow an amputee to control the movement of these multiple artificial joints in a natural and coordinated manner.



In another application, the myoelectric signal measured from facial muscles will be combined with acoustic speech information to design an automatic speech recognition system that provides improved performance under noisy conditions.  This system has applications for jet pilots, firefighters, and in rehabilitation as a voice prosthesis for individuals with temporary or permanent loss of speech.

"Novel Processes for Hydrogen Production and Purification: Our primary objective in this program already in place is to investigate novel processes for production of high-purity, high-pressure hydrogen for use in fuel cells. Our interest has been in high-pressure operation which promises significant savings by pressurizing liquid precursors and conducting the entire dehydrogenation and purification under increased pressure instead of having to pressurizing the gaseous hydrogen produced from conventional processes near atmospheric pressure. In this way, the energy (or work) of compressing the hydrogen product is saved. In my chemical reactor engineering laboratory, I have recently directed studies on the steam reforming of ethanol and in a novel process built on a cycle between ethanol and acetaldehyde that converts synthesis gas into hydrogen with virtually no further purification of the hydrogen. For these studies, a highly automated high-pressure reactor system has been designed and built. Steam reforming of ethanol has been directed at finding an attractive catalyst. In research recently completed, we have thoroughly characterized these catalysts and also studied loss of performance with time on stream. Our work confirms that 1) the dehydrogenation of ethanol to form hydrogen and acetaldehyde proceeds rapidly at 300�C with high selectivity and 2) acetaldehyde is easily hydrogenated to ethanol at 250�C on Cu-based catalysts. We now intend to find suitable catalysts for high-pressure operation in both the ethanol reforming and the acetaldehyde cycle. We will attempt to reproduce some earlier measurements at ambient pressure as a baseline for our high-pressure work. Initially, experiments will be extended to higher pressures (2 to 5 bar). For catalyst development, I propose to examine the use of Cu hydrotalcites as catalysts.

"The overall focus of our program is the development of efficient protocols for asymmetric synthesis of compounds of medicinal importance. The investigation of new methods of environmentally benign manufacturing or ""green"" synthesis benefits from the combination of biological methods with sound strategic planning of chemical pathways. The proposed research represents a well-integrated approach to two important groups: the morphine alkaloids and the Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, as well as medicinally useful derivatives of both. In addition, new biotransformations will be pursued in order to provide chiral building blocks and a chiral version of the Burgess reagent will be applied to the total synthesis of balanol.  

    Our well-integrated program follows the following objectives: (A) Biotransformations: (i) Whole-cell fermentations of arenes generate new chiral starting materials for manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. (ii) Yeast and fungal strains are employed in the synthesis of catalysts and C-14 oxygenated derivatives of morphine, respectively. (B) Two syntheses of anti-tumor agent pancratistatin are proposed. In addition, new strategies are presented for the generation of more bioavailable analogs of Amaryllidaceae constituents. (C) New approaches to morphine alkaloids are presented along with a short synthesis of oxycodone, an important pain medicine.   

(D) Serendipitous discoveries in asymmetric synthesis led to new reactive options for the Burgess reagent. Its chiral versions will be investigated in the synthesis of amino alcohols, important linkers in drug design. (E) These efforts culminate in the total  syntheses of balanol, a phosphokinase C inhibitor, and of Tamiflu, an important antiviral agent.

    Overall, this proposal addresses focused investigations in asymmetric synthesis driven by the use of biocatalytic methods for a greater ""green"" component. Highly qualified personnel at undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels will be trained in biocatalysis and synthesis for the Canadian pharmaceutical sector and marketable medicinal agents will be prepared.

"I have a long-term research program which seeks to understand factors that affect biological, geological and chemical processes in aquatic ecosystems and how human activities affect these processes. I have proposed to study three specific topics. 

1) The metabolic theory of ecology proposes that the physiological rate (e.g., respiration) of an organism is strongly influenced by its body size. The theory has been successfully applied to individuals and whole populations. It has also been used to predict total rates in ecosystems. However, at the ecosystem level, the theory has not been adequately validated. Therefore, I will test if the structure of lake food webs can be used to predict the cycling of minerals and the flow of energy in aquatic ecosystems.

2) Reductions in biodiversity may affect the processes that sustain ecosystems (i.e., nutrient recycling). However, most biodiversity studies are terrestrial and emphasize community processes. Research that integrates population and ecosystem approaches is urgently required to address biodiversity issues in aquatic environments. I will examine biodiversity and ecosystem processes in lakes that are exposed to a gradient of metals to establish when losses in biodiversity affect ecosystem function.

3) Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) are important substances affecting numerous processes in aquatic environments. Human perturbations (e.g., acidification) can cause reductions in these substances as seen in short-term studies. However, our understanding of the long-term effects of such perturbations on these substances is poor.  I will examine the long-term pattern in DON across multiple lakes and sites with respect to climate (e.g., solar radiation) and anthropogenic factors (e.g., sulfate deposition). Such information is necessary to predict the effects of climate change and pollutants on lakes.

"Current astronomical observations indicate that the ingredients in the Universe are 20% dark matter, 76% dark energy and 4% normal, baryonic matter. Yet the fundamental building blocks that we observe directly are galaxies, and these come in two flavours: red, mostly elliptical galaxies that have stopped forming stars today, and blue, spiral galaxies like our own Milky Way. This proposal adresses two of the most critical topics in cosmology. 



The first topic is galaxy evolution: how were galaxies formed and how did they evolve?  In particular, why did red galaxies stop forming new stars? We propose several projects to determine when, where and why star formation is shut off. Specifically, we will look at the dark matter to stellar matter content of nearby galaxies as a clue to their formation and merger history. We will also examine galaxies in special environments such as the outskirts of clusters where the cluster environment appears to be stripping the gaseous fuel from infalling galaxies, and in the centres of clusters, where some star formation is still ongoing. Another way to address this issue is to look back in time by observing more distant galaxies.  We will use the phenomenon of gravitational lensing to weigh the galaxies' matter content. This allows one to compare galaxies at high redshift with their low redshift counterparts of the same mass, and so determine how the stellar content has evolved with cosmic time.



The second topic is to measure the distribution of dark matter directly, using gravitational lensing on large scales, and peculiar velocities -- deviations from the uniform expansion -- on very large scales. These observations will reveal the statistical distribution of dark matter and allow us to check the basic framework of the standard cosmological model.

"The Chemical Sciences play a central role in the Life Sciences.  This is especially true in the current genomics and proteomics era which demand the development of new techniques, methods and materials to facilitate the study functional genomics, proteomics, and to be used in diagnostics or as chemotherapeutic agents.  



Our research focuses on the synthesis and application of modified nucleic acids and nucleic acid analogs.  We are expanding the repertoire of available DNA mimics, improving on current designs and providing new methods and materials for applications in other areas of science such as biosensor development, hybridization and detection assays, and antisense/antigene chemistry.  Our expertise lies in nucleobase modifications to endow DNA or peptide nucleic acid (PNA) with improved or new properties.  For example, we have recently described intrinsically fluorescent, pairing competent nucleobases which can report on hybridization events.  Such sequence selective fluorescence detection allows for the development of convenient methods for clinical, forensic or environmental diagnostics assays.

"Although most of the energy deposited by ionizing radiation in living tissue is quickly channeled into production of abundant low energy ions and electrons, traditional radiation science has largely ignored the effects of many of these ultra-fast reacting particles. However, our recent work has shown for the first time that even at unprecedented low energies their reactions lead to lethal breaks in DNA, as well as disintegration or elimination of nucleic acid bases whose sequence provides the actual genetic text inside the DNA; moreover, this leads to further production of numerous types of very reactive ions. What is still not known is this: how exactly do such ions initiate subsequent damage in DNA, or other important biomolecules. Our research will focus on the detailed reactions by which such ions can damage or modify DNA, and various biomaterials, using our novel technologies of microanalysis recently developed from methods of atomic/molecular physics, biochemistry, and radiation sciences. This multifaceted approach will complete our knowledge of the early origins of radiation damage, and how this may promote cell death and mutations; such knowledge is essential for realistic dose (or risk) assessment in various radiation environments, e.g. for reactor workers, air crews on high altitude flights, astronauts, and in clinical radiotherapy. For the latter case, the knowledge obtained from our studies will allow us to develop new methods to control and target the effects of radiation down to the nanoscopic molecular level, for example by designing new chemicals that sensitize the DNA in cancer cells to ionizing radiation, potentially leading to lower doses in cancer radiotherapy. Finally, these ion reaction studies will also provide new knowledge required for the further development of biotechnologies, such as new labeling methods of molecules for biomedical imaging, the modification of tissue-friendly biomaterials for implants, or the synthesis of new materials surfaces for biosensors and biochips used to advance biomedical research and drug discovery.","Physical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","M�decine nucl�aire et radiobiologie","Huels, Michael","RGPIN ","Physical chemistry","Physical chemistry","Chimie physique",3-5

"Despite continued advances in coastal and desert dune research, much less is known about the processes that maintain dune mobility in supply-limited landscapes. Specifically, knowledge gaps remain for the manner in which wind, topography, vegetation and surface conditions interact to maintain active dunes in vegetation-stabilized landscapes. Furthermore, seasonal changes in surface conditions controlling the effectiveness of aeolian processes at mid- to high-latitudes are poorly understood owing to fluctuating threshold conditions for wind erosion. This research program builds on results from recent field and theoretical studies to establish empirical relations between aeolian processes and dune mobility in the semi-arid Northern Great Plains (NGP) of Canada. Active dunes are essential for maintaining biodiversity in the NGP because they serve as critical habitat for endangered species requiring loose, mobile sand. Economic activities, particularly rangeland grazing and oil and gas development, are also significant in NGP dune systems, but little baseline information exists to help guide management strategies that minimize negative impacts and that conserve valued landscape processes and ecosystem components. To this end, this research program has three interrelated objectives. Students and I will first evaluate high-resolution airflow and sand transport dynamics so as to characterize flow-form interactions and feedback mechanisms that control the development and mobility of supply-limited parabolic dunes and blowouts. In a parallel study we will establish relations between meteorological variables and time-varying thresholds when sand transport is initiated so as to resolve the effects of seasonality on sand availability and transport rates. Finally, we will quantify the percentage of vegetation cover required to reduce dune mobility to selected amounts by measuring seasonal sand transport rates of dunes in varying stages of vegetation colonization. Overall, this research will provide essential input for the long-term goal of developing comprehensive process-response models to predict environmental impacts of climate change and economic development on dune mobility in the NGP.

"Scientists, philosophers, and young children alike have always been fascinated by optical phenomena. Why is the sky blue? Where do rainbows come from? At the root of all optical phenomena is the interaction of light and matter-the source of dynamics in nature. The fundamentals of light-matter interaction have been clarified by classical electromagnetism and quantum electrodynamics (QED), which are believed to explain all electromagnetic phenomena. James Clerk Maxwell introduced a transformational light-matter theory in the 1850s that described light in the form of electromagnetic radiation, just like radio waves and X-rays. One hundred and fifty years later, his theory and ""Maxwell's equations"" have been utilized as the de facto standard in modern communication technology based on transmitters and receivers, for mobile telephones, television and radio. Remarkably, these advances have taken place essentially within a regime where the interactions between radiation and matter are ""invariant"". Yet there is more.



Our research program will focus on light-matter interactions that are not invariant, but rather ""nano controllable."" This regime has been coined ""nanophotonics,"" and seeks to explore and exploit light-matter interactions in materials that contain spatial features that are on the nanometer (nm) length scale. This incredibly small size gives rise to a range of exciting new optical regimes where it is now possible to confine and manipulate individual photons and electrons simultaneously. Nanophotonics holds promise to revolutionize the fields of optical sensing, telecommunications, medicine, and computing. Our proposal is based upon the following two intertwined research strands, each of which has the potential to significantly impact both fundamental light-matter physics and imminent nanotechnologies ""cavity-QED enabled light sources"" and ""disorder-induced light localization"" in photonic crystal chips.  Target applications include quantum cryptography, optical sensing, and miniaturized light wave circuits.

"A suite of ambulatory data acquisition devices will be acquired to study cardiovascular control under normal functions of daily life as well as in controlled laboratory conditions. With ambulatory monitors of arterial blood pressure, blood flow velocity and tissue oxygenation, we will initiate new research areas that expand on our existing expertise in studies of cardiovascular dynamics. The nature of the equipment also insures that it will be used in standard laboratory conditions as well as ambulatory investigations. We pioneered the use of ultrasound imaging and Doppler ultrasound blood flow velocity measurements to quantify whole leg or forearm muscle blood flow during rest to exercise transitions under controlled laboratory conditions. Now we propose developing techniques that will permit quantification of brain and muscle blood flow and tissue oxygenation along with continuous arterial blood pressure under dynamic conditions of daily life: rising from bed or a chair, standing, walking or climbing steps. We continue to conduct, under controlled conditions with tethered equipment, studies of transitions from supine rest (with or without prior bed rest or in astronauts returning from the International Space Station), and we know that the simple transition of supine to seated, or of seated to standing positions causes a transient drop in arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity. What we do not yet know is what happens to blood pressure, brain blood flow velocity and oxygenation with normal transitions to activities of daily life. We will examine mechanisms responsible for low blood pressure on standing. We will examine changes in brain blood flow and oxygenation with activities of daily life with a focus on why regular exercise might increase brain blood flow potentially benefiting cognitive function in an aging population. Overall, these data will provide novel information on the inter-relationships between blood pressure, flow and oxygenation to the brain or exercising muscles.

"In our every day lives, we must constantly adapt to demands of changing posture or physical activity. My research program has taken an integrative perspective to merge information from the cellular level through to whole body adaptations to these daily challenges. When we begin physical activity, the cardiovascular system must adapt and pump blood containing oxygen to the working muscles. At the muscles, oxygen delivery interacts with the metabolic processes to supply the energy required to accomplish the task. My research has developed sensitive methods to non-invasively track the cardiovascular adaptations in exercising humans and will now expand to include magnetic resonance spectroscopy which is a non-invasive method to monitor changes in oxygen and metabolism inside an exercising muscle. Our work will reveal greater detail about control mechanisms and it will establish a solid basis upon which to study individuals who have abnormalities in their metabolic processes or diseases that limit supply of blood flow to the muscles. Each day on rising from bed, our cardiovascular control systems must function efficiently so that we can maintain an upright posture without fainting. While we know that women have many advantages over men in their avoidance of cardiovascular diseases, women also have a relatively greater incidence of dizziness or fainting when they stand. It is important to examine the differences between the sexes to determine how the cardiovascular system regulates the distribution of blood flow to the lower regions of the body in the legs or abdomen compared to brain blood flow. Recent evidence is suggesting that differences between individuals in their ability to regulate blood pressure is due at least in part to small differences in the genetic information that codes for various cardiovascular structures including estrogen receptors on blood vessels. By studying the relationship between the genotype and the ability to maintain blood pressure with a change in posture we will gain a more complete understand why large differences exist between individuals and we will be able to point to specific approaches that can prevent fainting in otherwise healthy men and women.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge",Kinesiology,"Hughson, Richard","RGPIN ","Animal circulation","Animal biology","Biologie animale",3-5

"This research program is in the area of experimental gas metal arc (GMA) welding process identification and control. The objective is to investigate the relationships between visual and acoustic signals that expert human welders can sense when welding, and the control actions they employ in response to these. 



The motivation for pursuing this research is that the current state-of-the-art in robotic GMA welding systems still rely on what is essentially open-loop control: parameter settings are preset to values that should result in a good quality weld for a given joint geometry under constant conditions. However, expert human welders continually make adjustments to the welding torch position and speed, as well as to the voltage and wire feed-rate, in response to what they see and hear while they are welding. This human feedback control system is learned through experience, and is very effective at producing high quality welds. However, arc welding is a tiring and hazardous job involving exposure to noxious fumes, heat and intense ultra violet radiation, and it would therefore be of great benefit to develop fully automated / robotic welding systems capable of providing comparable feedback control that human welders excel at.



The expected significance of this research is a better understanding of how professional welders react to the acoustic and visual cues they receive while welding, and how this can be applied to the automatic control of the GMA welding process. The benefits to society include the potential for reduced human exposure to the hazardous arc welding environment, while retaining the need for skilled welding professionals to oversee and program the robotic welding operations.

"Modern wireless systems have expanded mankind's ability to communicate without boundaries, sense our world, and deliver information ubiquitously in new and exciting ways. Next-generation wireless applications will depend strongly on enhancing the capabilities of the underlying physical technologies of these systems.  Evolutions in antenna technology are the cornerstones of these developments, and breakthroughs in antenna design and signal processing techniques will add new dimensions to the capabilities of wireless systems.  In particular, exciting research in reconfigurable and metamaterial antennas will pave the way to this end. Reconfigurable and metamaterial antennas operate by manipulating the electric and magnetic fields in the near-field of the antenna, hence scanning and measuring this near-field is of utmost relevance and importance.  This grant seeks funding for microwave instrumentation to complete a near-field antenna scanning facility under construction at the University of Toronto.  In addition, microwave absorbers and a software upgrade will complete this facility.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering, Edward S.

"As wireless communications systems have evolved and grown in complexity, so have the demands they place on the antenna which is a critical component of these systems.  As such, antenna arrays are of major technological interest because of their ability to passively improve link gain, reduce interference, and dynamically adjust their radiation patterns in response to changes in the environment.  However, implemented in their traditional form, antenna arrays are very costly in terms of the amount of hardware required, particularly in high gain antenna arrays utilizing many antenna elements.  From a performance perspective, new research is needed to improve the gain, power-handling, and bandwidth of antenna arrays to meet the needs and economical constraints of new wireless systems.



The goal of the proposed research is to develop high performance antenna array architectures that address limitations with traditional arrays while providing the same or better in terms of functionality and performance. This will be accomplished by investigating four unique antenna array architectures.  Two of the architectures are based on enhancing the performance and functionality of electronically tunable reflectarrays, an emerging antenna technology that implements a type of array at a much lower cost.   The other two projects aim to investigate alternative array topologies, and extend antenna arrays into the ultra-wideband communication systems where arrays have not been widely employed.



The proposed research will ultimately enable the cost-effective adoption of antenna array technology in a wide variety of sectors, including telecommunications, aerospace, and manufacturing.  However, more than creating technology, the proposed research will also train highly qualified researchers and provides them with a wide variety of high-tech skills for fueling Canada's expertise in these areas.

"The primary objective of the seismic design of a building is to ensure that the building will meet specified performance goal(s) when subjected to a specified seismic hazard. The hazard will depend on the frequency of the design seismic event. Often several different levels of hazard must be considered, from the one produced by a frequent earthquake to one produced by a very rare earthquake. Seismic design thus requires the definition of the various levels of hazard for which the building must be designed as well as the quantitative measures of the acceptable performance level corresponding to each level of hazard. A quantitative measure of performance that is widely accepted in the engineering community is the displacement experienced by the structure, or more specifically the interstorey drift. The design methodology whose objective is to ensure that the drifts experienced by the structure when it is subjected to design earthquakes do not exceed the acceptable values of such drifts is known as displacement-based design. The applicant's ongoing research in the emerging field of displacement-based design has led to the development of practical tools for the design of steel and reinforced concrete structures having simple framing and regular geometry. The proposed research study will deal with the displacement-based design of structures with other structural framing systems including hybrid frame wall structures, braced frame structures   and structures with irregular layout and geometry. The methodology used in the research will rely on the realistic analyses of a series of structural systems for representative ground motions.



The second part of the study will be devoted to the validation of the developed design method through the analyses of the designed structure for their response to ground motions that reflect the seismic hazard at the site.

"Current observations of warming in arctic and subarctic regions support model predictions of climate change associated with a rise in atmospheric greenhouse gases.  Associated changes in surface radiative properties, energy exchanges, and the exchanges of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in northern ecosystems have the potential to greatly accelerate global climate change during this century.  Globally, ecosystems north of the tree line store roughly a quarter of the world's soil organic carbon (C) pool within soils that are frozen and/or saturated for the majority of the year.  However, due to the very limited temporal and geographical extent of C flux studies in arctic and subarctic regions, particularly in Canada, it is uncertain if these ecosystems are currently behaving as sinks for atmospheric C and it is difficult to predict how these ecosystems will respond to future climate change.

The major goals of this research are to:  1) quantify the temporal variability of CH4 and CO2 exchanges over a range of spatial scales using micrometeorological and chamber techniques, 2) improve our understanding of the factors controlling plant and microbial production/consumption of CO2 and CH4 using natural gradients and field manipulations of water table and temperature conditions, and 3) estimate current and future regional atmospheric C fluxes through the development of mechanistic models.  These research activities will be carried out in Canada at a) a mixed tundra upland and tundra fen at Daring Lake in the Southern Arctic ecozone and b) a subarctic upland and peatland within the region of the Taiga Shield/Taiga Plains ecozones.  This proposal aims to build upon the research carried out in the Daring Lake area since 2004, establish new research in the highly climate-sensitive region of discontinuous permafrost, and provide the first measurements of continuous ecosystem-scale CH4 fluxes in a Canadian arctic peatland.  Data from this study will be vitally important to the development and validation of coupled carbon climate models thus far hindered by a lack of information about ecosystem functioning at northern high latitudes.

"Many physical processes can be modelled by systems of differential equations for which exact solutions cannot be constructed. Nevertheless either, analytical techniques can be used to deduce characteristic features of the solution, or numerical techniques can be used to find highly accurate approximations to solutions. But, in many of these processes there is a natural delay built into the system, which can be either be a fixed time delay, or in more complex models the length of the delay itself can depend on the current or past state of the system. One situation where such problems arise is in the study of travelling wave solutions in spatially discrete media, such as crystal lattices. There, the travelling wave, which propagates through the medium with a fixed form and velocity,  is defined by differential delay equations where the solution depends on both past and future states. Such intuitively absurd equations arise in a surprisingly wide variety of problems from nerve fibre propagation to solid/liquid interface propagation to traffic flow to relativistic electro-dynamics. 



We are studying these problems using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. Particular questions of interest concern the phenomenon of waveblock in nerve fibre conduction, when signals fail to propagate along a degraded fibre, to stability of traffic flows, to more fundamental questions related to causality in physics arising in Wheeler and Feynman's relativistic advanced-retarded action-at-a-distance model of electrodynamics.

"Ecology attempts to describe patterns of where and at what abundance organisms occur, as well as identifying the processes responsible for these patterns. Physiology focuses on how organisms work, attempting to explain the mechanisms that permit organisms to function in variable and often harsh environments. Although physiology should therefore be an important source of processes underlying ecological patterns, the interchange between the two fields has been impeded by incompatible approaches and areas of emphasis. My research addresses some of these impediments by studying the physiology of animals in natural environments in an attempt to link environmental conditions, physiological responses, and population patterns. I conduct this research on several species of small to medium-sized mammals (e.g., red squirrels, eastern chipmunks, beaver, little brown bats), because aspects of their biology, distribution, and behaviour make them suitable for accurate measurement of physiological and ecological traits. The aspect of their physiology that I study is energy metabolism, because this trait reflects both the amount of energy that needs to be acquired from the environment and the amount energy that is available for growth and reproduction. My basic research approach involves documenting and manipulating (e.g., food supplementation) the environmental conditions experienced by a population, then measuring the short-term metabolic responses to these conditions, then evaluating how these metabolic responses translate into longer-term effects on survival, reproduction and population abundance. As a result, this research helps explain and predict the responses of animal populations to environmental change, especially in northern regions where most of the research is conducted.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Natural Resource Sciences","Humphries, Murray","RGPIN ","Animal ecology","Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",2-5

"In this proposed research program, mobile services (m-services) can be seen as the integration of mobile and services computing such as wireless technologies and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). M-services architectures are built on an insecure, unmonitored and shared environment, which is open to events such as security threats. It is because m-services inherit the known and unknown security weaknesses that are associated with the architecture of wireless technologies and SOA. As is the case with many other applications, the information processed in m-services might be commercially sensitive, so it is important to protect it from security and privacy threats such as disclosure to unauthorized parties.



In the context of a long term research program (5-10 years) on mobile services computing security and privacy, this proposed research program focuses on the privacy access control theoretical model with negotiation support for protecting the sensitive information in m-services. The negotiation-enabled model provides for greater flexibility in supporting privacy access control decision-making processes in m-services. This model is particularly important for supporting m-services in a mobile dynamic environment. On the other hand, the major short-term objectives (within 5 years) of this proposed research program are to: (1) develop a theoretical model of privacy policies for m-services; (2) build a privacy access control negotiation model for m-services; and (3) demonstrate the completed model in an illustrative application, e.g., healthcare.

"Dynamic analysis of rock fall motion (""rock fall ballistics"") is used in practice to obtain design paramaters for structures protecting transportation routes such as road and railways, or buildings from damage due to rocks falling from cliffs.  The main design parameters required are: 1)  the height of fock fall trajectories above ground (to determine the required size of the protective fence or similar) and 2)  the potential impact forces excerted by rock fragments on the structure.  Although there are several computer-based models available that claim to be able to predict these parameters, the predictions are known to be highly unreliable.  This is due to overly-simplified and poorly-calibrated physical representation of interactions between the falling fragment and the slope.  Based on our long experience in this field, we propose to conduct a focussed research with the purpose of improving the predictive performance of such models.  Increased reliability and reduced cost of remedial structures on roads and railways will result.

"Intervertebral disc-related low back pain is one of the most significant orthopaedic disorders in industrialized society, costing the U.S. economy some $50-100 billion annually, with comparable per capita costs to the Canadian economy. Despite the economic burden of intervertebral disc (IVD) disease, few options are available to patients. Pharmacotherapies and physical therapy treat the symptoms without treating the underlying condition, while surgical intervention has a 40% failure rate and is not practical in a significant portion of patients. Therefore new therapies are required.  Regenerative medicine holds considerable promise for slowing or reversing degenerative conditions by bolstering the body's own regenerative capacity. In general, regenerative medicine systems use a combination of cells, materials, and exogenous stimuli to deliver a therapeutic package to the tissue. In this proposal, we will assemble a multidisciplinary team with expertise in stem cells, biomaterials, exogenous stimuli, and surgical methods to investigate the potential of using mesenchymal stem cells to treat IVD degeneration. Rather than develop a single implantable material, we will use our multidisciplinary approach to develop the building blocks of a complete therapeutic system, including cell expansion and preparation, biomaterial development, ex vivo and in vivo models, and surgical delivery techniques in 3 parallel, interconnected Specific Aims.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering","Hunter, Christopher","CHRPJ ","Biomedical engineering","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",2-3
"There are two research foci in my laboratory.  



First, we aim to establish evolutionary trees that reflect the accurate identification and classification of biting flies such as mosquitoes and black flies.  The relationships that we establish can then be used in comparative ecological studies.

In order to identify these insects, we use a total evidence approach, which means that we study a wide variety of traits including morphological, cytological (chromosomal), behavioural and molecular (DNA sequence) characters.  There are many cryptic species among the biting flies and not all behave in the same way or have the same ecological requirements.  We have evidence that some have different sugar-feeding preferences and blood-feeding preferences and not all cryptic species are competent vectors of disease. Thus, our research is important for the broader fields of medical and veterinary entomology.



Second, we study blood-feeding and sugar-feeding preferences among closely related species of biting flies in order to determine which species (or cryptic species) are potential vectors of disease.  We are examining specific diseases such as a rodent malaria and bird malaria to determine if sugar-feeding preferences influence disease transmission.  Finally, one student is studying the breeding site requirements of Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit human malaria in Ecuador and Peru in order to determine if they will be able to broaden their ranges into highland areas as global warming increases.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Biological Sciences","Hunter, Fiona","RGPIN ",Behaviour,"Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",1-1
"Central neuropathic pain (CNP) is a devastating, unrelenting pain that can occur after a disease or injury to the central nervous system such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury (SCI). CNP adversely impacts the quality of life of individuals with SCI. There are no successful treatments for CNP in part because the mechanisms underlying CNP vary between patients. Animal studies have identified a number of nervous system abnormalities that produce the symptoms similar to CNP in humans. Unfortunately, it is difficult to translate the findings from animal studies into simple tests that can be used in humans to identify the specific mechanism(s) that produce each individual's CNP. One mechanism of CNP is the release of normal inhibitory control of thermosensory pathways or ""thermosensory disinhibition"", that is, the loss of the normal inhibition of pain by cold following damage to the temperature pathway. We will develop a thermal grill (TG) apparatus to enable the determination of a psychophysical measure called the thermal grill illusion (TGI) in individuals with CNP. The TG produces is an illusion of pain that can be used to detect the presence or absence cold inhibition of pain within the central nervous system. Prior research has shown that the TGI could be used for this purpose, but, as yet there is no commercially available TG. Furthermore, the TGI has only been tested on the hand or forearm of able-bodied individuals, but CNP can occur in any area of the body. The new TG (""REL-TG"") will enable us to evaluate the TGI in multiple body regions among individuals with SCI-related CNP. This complex process requires close collaboration of engineers, clinicians, and neuroscientists to develop a simple test that can be used both clinically (at the bedside) and experimentally (in research studies) to identify the existence of a pain producing mechanism among individuals with CNP. The final phase of this project will provide pilot data for future studies that will identify subgroups of patients with TGI and allow correlation of the findings with the underlying CNP mechanism(s). Successful REL-TG development and testing will represent a major advancement in the ability to guide mechanism-based therapeutic approaches for CNP.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Health, education and social services","Physical Therapy","Hunter, Judith","CHRPJ ","Medical sciences","Medical sciences","Sciences m�dicales",2-3

"We are all exposed to ionizing radiation (X-rays, gamma-rays) from natural sources (radon; cosmic radiation) and diagnostic procedures and sometimes from radiotherapy. We have made several novel findings concerning the mode of action of ionizing radiation. It has long been known that ionizing radiation induces crosslinks between the two DNA strands in the double helix. However, little is known about the mechanism of this process or about how the cell goes about repairing this damage. Most work has focused on DNA double strand breaks as being the most toxic lesion induced by ionizing radiation with little attention being paid to crosslinks. We have a surprising discovery: ionizing radiation induces crosslinks in regions of DNA in which the two strands are separated. We have used a radiosensitizer, bromodeoxyuridine, which replaces one of the four normal DNA bases, to increase the crosslink frequency, which makes the analysis of the crosslinks easier. We have found that crosslink formation depends on DNA conformation and sequence. We now propose to determine the chemical structure of the crosslinks so that we can measure their formation and repair in living cells following exposure to ionizing radiation. We have used simple model systems: synthetic DNA and plasmids (small circular DNAs); however, our premise is that the fundamental reactivity of the species formed in the irradiated DNA will be similar in cells and in our model systems. We realize that proteins in the cell nucleus will exert effects and will sometimes react with the DNA. Nevertheless, we predict that ionizing radiation will preferentially form crosslinks in single stranded regions of the genome. Single stranded regions of DNA exist in cells during DNA replication (replication forks), RNA replication (transcription bubbles), at the ends of chromosomes (the D-loop of telomeres), at DNA bulges (where an additional base is present on one strand) and, possibly, at transition zones between B and Z DNA where a base is flipped out of the helix.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","M�decine nucl�aire et radiobiologie","Hunting, Darel","RGPIN ",Biochemistry,Biochemistry,Biochimie,1-5

"The problems caused by the fossil fuel economy are well known.  With the advances in fuel cell technology an economy based on hydrogen as an energy carrier is now seriously considered.  The advantages of a hydrogen economy include:

-    )	The elimination of the pollution caused by fossil fuels

-    )	Elimination of greenhouse effect

-    )	Economic independence

-    )	Distributed production

These benefits are so important that the push toward a hydrogen economy is very strong.  However, its emergence depends on solving two main problems: Hydrogen production and storage. Hydrogen storage is particularly challenging for on-board passenger vehicles.  Three technologies are presently considered: liquid hydrogen, high pressure tanks, and metal hydrides. Metal hydrides are potentially the most suitable systems for vehicular and stationary applications.  

Metal hydrides have high volumetric storage capacity (higher than liquid hydrogen) and could offer a technological solution for on-board or stationary applications. Our objective is to develop new metal hydride materials and new synthesis methods that could meet the industry specification.  In the present research we will investigate the use of cold rolling for production of high capacity hydrogen storage material. Up to now the study of cold rolling for production of metal hydrides has been very limited.  However, this technique has numerous advantages such as: easily scalable, well known by the industry, and energy efficient.  If proved applicable, this technique could help in the commercialization of metal hydrides.

"The outcome of the increasing anthropogenic pressure on aquatic ecosystems ranges from local changes in the algal species inhabiting lakes to the global acidification of the oceans. To provide a better stewardship of our planet, a deeper understanding of such processes and their consequences is necessary.

 

This research program focuses on the ecology and physiology of phytoplankton, tiny photosynthetic organisms which form the basis of many aquatic foodwebs. My aim is to understand how the different phytoplanktonic species will respond to environmental changes affecting their habitat and identify the underlying reasons for these responses. To do so, a variety of innovative approaches including satellite remote sensing, laboratory experiments, and an automated lake observatory are utilized to examine phytoplankton in the global ocean and lakes. With these tools and approaches our team will probe phytoplankton from the single cell to the global ocean and observe their responses from the seconds to the decadal timescales. The result of this research should be a greater understanding of the steps required to keep aquatic ecosystems healthy.

"My research aims to explain why some individuals are more aggressive than others.  Natural and sexual selection ought to produce social behaviours which are approximately optimal in trading off the costs and benefits of aggression.  Each individual ought to be trading-off ultimate, or evolutionary, costs and benefits across a number of time scales and currencies by ""choosing"" different life strategies.  For example, a more aggressive male may be more successful in gaining a breeding territory, but pay higher physiological costs and be less attractive to females, or be less effective at parenting, than a less aggressive male.  Understanding which traits are constrained by proximate mechanisms, which traits are physiologically linked, and covary is essential to understanding how evolution shapes this complex trait.

    I will investigate the effect of variation in early hormone exposure, within normal ranges, on long-term behavioural and endocrinological variation.  Digit ratio (2D:4D, the ratio of index to ring finger length) is a widely used proxy measure for prenatal testosterone exposure in humans; men tend to have lower 2D:4D ratios than do women.  Many psychological, and physiological traits show intrasexual covariation with digit ratio in humans, including aggression.  I will investigate how digit ratio correlates with other putative indicators of prenatal androgen exposure in humans, and with variation in brain and behaviour in mice.  I expect to identify other factors that contribute to digit ratio variation, and explore further the neural and behavioural correlates of digit ratio variation.

    I will also test the same theories by investigating how environmental sex determination influences brain and behaviour in cichlid fish.  Beyond influencing sex, such environmental variation ought to exert influence on the neural basis of sexually dimorphic behaviours in the same way that neighbouring males in utero influence mouse brain and behaviour.

    I will continue to investigate extensive form games as a model of the evolution of aggressive behaviour.

"Sophisticated mathematical modelling has now been enshrined in the Basel II Accord on Capital Measurement and Capital Standards as a strategic element of paramount importance in the regulatory environment of the global finance industry. Perhaps the most exciting open research topic in this area is the credit risk problem, a basic form of which is to model the dynamics of the corporate bond market, in particular the causes of defaults, jointly with the now understood dynamics of stock and fixed income markets. Mathematically, it means to develop a no-arbitrage (NA) framework which nests the pricing of equities, government bonds, and the default risky bonds of publicly listed corporations, which then implies a consistent methodology for pricing and hedging all associated derivative securities, including important products such as credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). An accurate credit framework would lead to more reliable financial trading and risk management systems, helping to stabilize the world's markets from inevitable future default shocks as dramatic as those of Enron, WorldCom and the like. My proposal is to develop useful and accurate realizations of the multifirm Affine Markov Chain (AMC) framework introduced in 2005 by Hurd and Kuznetsov, and to establish AMC as a leading mathematical framework for credit risk. Realization of a useful AMC model requires completion of three tasks: to connect its components with the market drivers of default intensity; to derive pricing formulas for market traded credit products; to develop calibration techniques to fit these formulas to market data. Techniques developed along the way, for instance the saddlepoint method for CDOs, and the method of stochastic time change, will also be applied to extend existing credit methods. Beyond its potential impact on trading and risk management for banks, investment funds and insurance companies, my proposal will have an additional impact on HQP: my research associates, as they leave PhiMAC (the Financial Mathematics Lab at McMaster), will be in high demand for key careers both in the finance industry and academia, both in Canada and worldwide.","Mathematical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Mathematics and Statistics","Hurd, Thomas","RGPIN ","Applied mathematics","Applied mathematics","Math�matiques appliqu�es",3-5
"The mining and minerals processing industries annually contribute $40 billion (3.6% of the GDP) to the Canadian economy through both direct expenditures in the industry and associated communities and through commodity exports.  While significant mineral reserves remain to be discovered in Canada and internationally, these reserves are located at greater depths than presently known minerals deposits and advanced technologies are required to locate them.  Maintenance of competitiveness for Canadian mining companies, both in local and world markets, requires investments to develop the advanced technologies and to train skilled people to use the technologies.



The major objectives of this research program are two-fold:1) to modify and extend seismic techniques to provide cost-effective access to deeper subsurface information, 2) to develop new methods for joint and collaborative inversion of the wide variety of geological and geophysical data that become available as part of an exploration program.  Laboratory-based technique and algorithm development will be followed by field-based testing of the most promising laboratory results.  Field testing will be conducted in collaboration with Vale Inco at the world-class nickel-copper-cobalt deposit at Voisey's Bay, Labrador.  The Voisey's Bay site provides an outstanding opportunity to design well-constrained, high-return geophysical experiments due to the abundance of available borehole information and the range in the complexity of the ore body geometries.  Close collaboration with the exploration/production staff of Vale Inco will provide the technical expertise and logistical support required to operate a large-scale research project in Labrador.  The knowledge base derived from this research will move directly into the public domain through publication in recognized scientific journals and in trade magazines with broad industrial distribution.

"Reflection seismology is a method of imaging the Earth's interior by introducing waves into the subsurface and timing the waves that are reflected back to the surface by changes in the Earth's properties.  The process is similar that used by bats for echo location and to ultrasound used in medical imaging.  Our research involves adapting present seismic techniques and developing new approaches to applying reflection seismology and similar geophysical tools to a range of nontraditional problems.  One such problem is the characterization of heterogeneity in underground aquifers and oil reservoirs to help understand the flow of fluids through these systems.  Another problem that we are working on is the need to develop new, more economical approaches for locating and evaluating deeper minerals deposits.  To address this problem, we are taking advantage a state-of-the-art data acquisition system and applying antennae theory to develop a near real-time detection system designed to identify high quality targets for test drilling.  At a larger scale we are developing approaches aimed at mapping the plumbing of large-scale magmatic systems with the objective of increased understanding of the evolution of the Earth's crust and the development and distribution of minerals deposits.  This ongoing work has led to the first high-resolution images of large-scale intrusive bodies in the middle crust and combined with geological data provides strong evidence of significant crustal melting during the last stages of the continental collision in the Grenville orogen.

    )	Because reflection seismology is the highest resolution tool available for imaging the subsurface below a depth of ~ 100 m, advances in the seismic technique resulting from our research increase our understanding of the characteristics and operation of a variety of subsurface systems that are important to sustainable living in Canada as well as exploration for hydrocarbons and metals.    )	","Earth sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Earth Sciences","Hurich, Charles","RGPIN ","Applied geophysics",Geophysics,"G�ophysique",3-5

"As the sources of conventional light crude are depleting and its price increasing, refineries are more forced to use heavy oils, oil sands and bitumens as feasible substitutes. In Canada, the oil sands deposits of northern Alberta, occur in layers with thickness up to 100 m, spread over more than 40,000 km2. The deposits contain about 1.3 trillion barrels of crude oil equivalent. Currently, only small fraction of the total bitumen reserves of Northern Alberta are recoverable using the current in-situ and surface mining techniques. The larger percentage, about 93%, of bitumen resources are too deep to mine. The cost of heavy oil extraction and the environmental impact of surface mining mandate the search and development of new and innovative in-situ technologies for recovery and upgrading, which would provide access to the deeper deposits of bitumen.

In-situ heavy oil upgrading makes use of the current enhanced oil recovery platforms; including air injection and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), with the objective of carrying out upgrading reactions within reservoirs, and targeting the production of the light oil cuts only. These upgrading reactions are to be promoted with special solid surfaces, catalysts, very big in size and very well distributed within the heavy oil matrix. In-situ heavy oil upgrading is much more cost effective, provides more access to heavy oil deposits, and spares the environment the impact of hazardous effluent streams associated with on-surface upgrading. 

Our research aims at studying the formation, stabilization, catalytic reactivity of ultradispersed nanocatalysts within heavy oil reservoirs. The proposed research targets nanocatalysts for heavy oil hydrocracking, which involves reduction of the hydrocarbon chain length, saturation of unsaturated carbon bonds and the removal of hetero atoms such as sulfur and nitrogen. If successful, this research should provide: (a) an in-situ ultradispersed nanocatalyst preparation technique in heavy oil reservoirs, (b) clues on maximizing the colloidal concentration of the nanocatalysts, (c) identifying the best hydrocracking catalyst and optimum in-situ hydrocracking conditions (temperature, hydrogen partial pressure, etc.).

"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used in many applications, such as security, military, agriculture, automation, and habitat monitoring purposes. Although sensors have been used for decades, due to the latest developments in the electronics industry, it is possible to add some processing, storage, and communication resources with the sensors. However, due to limited battery power supply, it is necessary to design energy efficient communication techniques, which could extend battery life from a couple of days to a few years. Further, as sensors are deployed in harsh and hostile environments, it is necessary to incorporate security, trust management, and fault tolerant techniques; otherwise, the sensor data will not be reliable.



I will use a database approach to reduce the burden of the application developer. The user will specify the query in a simple English-like language. However, the proposed middleware will address the following concerns: a) energy efficient communication, b) security and trust management and c) fault tolerance. I will use intelligent techniques such as genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and simulated annealing to obtain energy efficient communication. Also, I will use endocrine communication system of the human body as a model to design energy efficient heterogeneous WSN. For security, I will develop energy efficient key management techniques to address the following issues: confidentiality, integrity and authentication, as well as several attacks such as man-in-the-middle, collusion and replay. The proposed middleware will be validated and verified for several deployment environments using a WSN testbed (e.g., WINTeR). 



The proposed middleware will be useful for several applications such as: a) industry process control automation, e.g., CNA Plant (training facility in St. John's, NL) and Hibernia (oil refinery near St. John's, NL) and b) intelligent applications for smart environments (nursing homes and tele-health).

"This research proposes several improved methologies to deal with various statistical analysis problems of relevance in areas such as clinical trials, count data arising in toxicology, genetic linkage analysis of complex diseases, industrial quality control, and microarray data analysis. 



Specifically, I am proposing sequential methods for testing statistical hypotheses when the parameter space of interest is constrained. In general, if we know that parameters are restricted by some constraints then it is reasonable to expect that testing procedures incorporating the restrictions should be more powerful than those ignoring them.  An example of a model in which this happens is the one arising when testing whether or not a given gene is responsible for certain disease in the presence of other genes at different loci that may also be responsible for the disease. In such cases, the number of recombinants (a measure of the degree of linkage)   has a binomial mixture. Collecting data for such genetic studies requires many years and large financial support. The methods I am proposing will include hypotheses testing of this type and are expected to reduce the total sample needed for making decision. Moreover, the shrinkage sequential estimation methods proposed in this project are expected to reduce the sample size needed in DNA microarray data analysis while borrowing information across the genes. This is important, as the cost of a  microarray is quite high.



Other methods in my proposal are empirical Bayes methods for the analysis of count data. These methods are also expected to be more efficient in estimating the average count and at the same time incorporating prior knowledge that is available in the form of auxiliary information (covariates or prognostic factors).

"Simultaneous measurement of the lightning current and its associated electric and magnetic fields, and the

determination of lightning channel characteristics are necessary for the quantitative assessment of lightning

return-stroke models. Such assessments will enhance our understanding of the lightning return-stroke process,

help in the formulation of new models that can be more successfully used in lightning detection algorithms, and

permit the development of more sophisticated measures for lightning protection. Simultaneous measurements

of the lightning current and its radiated electromagnetic pulse are possible using instrumented tall structures, or

rocket- or laser-triggered lightning. The CN Tower, with its extreme height, presents one of the best options in

the world to carry out this investigation. This fact led to the initiation of an important phase of the CN Tower

lightning studies. By the start of the summer of 1991, five measurement stations were operational to

simultaneously capture all relevant lightning parameters including the lightning current derivative and its

associated electromagnetic field. Many lightning return-stroke current models have been evaluated on the basis

of unrelated statistical information about lightning currents and lightning-generated electromagnetic fields;

notable exceptions include the use of instrumented towers or rocket-triggered lightning. During the proposed

project, a detailed and rigorous analysis of this transient electromagnetic field problem will be carried out with

the aim of developing a more experimentally verifiable return-stroke model. Although CN Tower lightning

flashes are mostly of the upward-initiated type, downward-initiated flashes, similar to ordinary ground flashes,

have been observed at the tower. Therefore, the developed model can be evaluated using the two types of

lighting. In present models, it is assumed that lightning channels are straight and vertical, contrary to most

observations. In this project, a three-dimensional image of the lighting channel will be constructed from video

records and used, in addition to the measured (height-dependent) return-stroke velocity, for the development of

an experimentally verified lightning return-stroke model.",Engineering,"Advancement of knowledge","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Hussein, Ali","RGPIN ","Photon devices","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",3-5

"My research interests involve the ionospheric high-latitude E- (altitude about 100 km) and F- regions (altitude of 200 to 1000 km) of the Earth's ionosphere.  The ionosphere is the portion of the atmosphere where there are relatively few, although physically sufficient, free electrons and ions (ionised or charged particles) present within the already very low neutral atmosphere concentration at these E- and F-region altitudes.  These charged particles significantly influence the behaviour in these regions and form the transition region, or near-Earth space environment, between our neutral Earth environment and the outer space environment.  The E-region has a low concentration of ionised particles which can be setup into oscillating structures due to flowing currents.  These structures are know as plasma waves and can be detected with radars looking into this region.  Similar plasma structures occur in the F-region where the ionisation concentration is larger, but still relatively small overall.  My research uses radars to probe and characterise the plasma environment of the E- and F-regions.  One type of radar scatters radio waves from plasma waves to give details such as plasma wave strength and motions.  Another type of radar reflects radio waves from the ionised particles to give information about particle density and motions.  Working with these radars, and other instruments which measure different important ionospheric parameters, allows researchers to better understand the ionosphere and the processes within it.  This, in turn, will enhance our understanding and ability to predict `space weather.'  Space weather affects our modern daily lives in a number of ways, such as: 1) our dependence on the now large number of Earth satellites used for communication, television, banking, etc. and the direct exposure of these satellites to the potentially damaging space environment; 2) the very recent exponential increase in commercial airline flight paths over the pole and their critical dependence on reliable communications at these high latitudes.  As Canada is a high northern latitude country with extensive northern landmass, we are in the ideal situation to study and support fundamental space weather research and predictions for the benefit of all humankind.

"There are two main parts of this proposal, to quantify the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) stored by direct injection at the Weyburn EnCana - International Energy Agency site and the PennWest CO2 Injection Pilot Site, and to examine the role of basalt weathering in cold and warm climates as a sink for CO2. 



The geological storage of CO2 by deep (1.5 - 2 km) injection is part of an on-going research project, the data for which has been gathered at the Weyburn oil field in Saskatchewan and the PennWest oil field in Alberta. In Weyburn injection of CO2 began in 2000 and fluid samples have been obtained three times a year to monitor the progress of CO2. The PennWest site has been monitored monthly since February 2005. The geochemical characteristics of the samples have been analyzed and the data are being examined to determine how CO2 interacts with fluids (oil and water) and minerals in the rock. These interactions will allow estimates of the length of time that CO2 can be safely stored in reservoirs. 



The second activity of the proposal examines how differences in basalt weathering in cold and warm climates impact riverine flux of elements and the CO2 content of the ocean and atmosphere. Weathering plays a major role in regulating ocean and atmospheric chemistry. Global river fluxes of Ca, Mg and bicarbonate are derived from weathering of various rocks and this affects the long-term cycle of CO2 and the chemical composition of the ocean. Although the annual contribution of dissolved riverine carbon to the global flux is small (less than 1 Gt/yr) it is not trivial. Most published research has focused on river fluxes and their contribution to the global carbon budget, less is known about the interface between surface waters and biological respiration in soils and how that contributes dissolved species to rivers. This study focuses on the interface between surface and subsurface waters and how that interface affects the global flux of CO2 during weathering.

"My research focuses on the tremendous variability in reproductive strategies within and among natural populations.  Such life-history variation is reflected by individual differences in fitness-related characters, such as age & size at maturity, number of eggs per female, and offspring size.  To what extent is the source of this variability genetic, environmental, or some combination thereof?  This is a fundamental question to evolutionary ecology and conservation biology.  Firstly, the source of this variation determines whether life-history responses to environmental perturbations, such as habitat alteration and harvesting, will be rapid, slow, or indeed whether they will occur at all.  Secondly, the nature of the life-history response can affect a population's ability to recover from collapse, persist through time, and sustain exploitation.  Using several species of fish as study organisms, my general objectives are:  1) to determine how alternative reproductive tactics are maintained in variable environments; 2) to assess the adaptive significance of sex-biased dispersal and mobility; 3) to study factors that affect the ability of populations to recover following collapse to historically unprecedented levels of abundance; and 4) to evaluate the influence of fisheries-induced evolution on phenotypic plasticity.  Specifically, my first study asks how different male reproductive tactics persist within populations of Atlantic salmon.  The second, building upon a 20-year data set, seeks to understand why males disperse further, and have greater mobility, than females within a stream population of brook trout.  The third study explores factors related to mating and reproduction that may hinder the recovery of marine fish, such as the Atlantic cod which has declined 99% off Newfoundland since 1992.  Using zebrafish, the fourth project examines whether size-differential mortality can generate a selection response in life-history reaction norms over several generations, potentially leading to a reduced individual capacity to respond to environmental change.  The significance of the proposed research to evolutionary ecology and conservation biology lies in its potential to predict life-history responses to short- and long-term environmental change.

"My research addresses questions pertaining to the biodiversity of Arctic fishes.  Firstly, I am studying Atlantic cod that inhabit a coastal lake (Ogac Lake) on Frobisher Bay, well beyond the northern extreme of the species' range in Canadian marine waters.  This population is of conservation concern, having been assessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) as Special Concern in 2003.  Preliminary genetic analyses suggest that this population is a glacial relict and has remained isolated from its marine counterparts for thousands of years.  Interestingly, the genetic diversity of this population is greater than that recorded for any marine fish.  Preliminary analyses also suggest that these cod have unique life histories. Unusual life histories may also underlie the extraordinary variation in body morphology characteristic of Arctic char inhabiting Lake Hazen, Ellesmere Island.  Here, within the northernmost population of char in the world, individuals express two, possibly three, morphological types.  Identifying the ecological and evolutionary basis for this unique aspect of Arctic fish biodiversity is the primary objective of this second aspect of my research.  Thirdly, I am studying the ecology and life history of Arctic marine fishes, notably those for which there is no commercial importance and about which we know exceedingly little.  I have initiated studies on several species (including sculpins and snailfish) whose southern range extends to Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  Thus, in addition to obtaining fundamentally important, novel information on marine biodiversity in the North, my work allows me to examine the life history adaptations of various species at the extremes of their geographical range, a question of current importance in conservation biology.



New knowledge on Arctic fish biodiversity resulting from this research will contribute to Canada's national and international obligations to protect biodiversity.  It will also provide biological data to northern and Aboriginal organizations of importance to their assessments of the harvest and conservation status of Arctic fishes.

"The research projects proposed are focused on identification and management of slope stability hazards with the objective of maximizing public safety and minimizing impact to infrastructure. Large landslides, such as the Frank and Hope slides in the West, and the Saint-Jean-Vianney and Lemieux slides in the East, have focused attention on understanding these types of failures. Excellent work is being done by other researchers and government agencies to assess the potential for suspected landslides in these materials in Canada.    

     In Europe, a series of projects have been undertaken to develop methodologies to map landslide instances (inventory maps), and to estimate (qualitative) or calculate (quantitative) landslide susceptibility maps. More recently landslide risk maps, considering both the probability and consequence of failure, are being produced, as approaches to quantify failure consequence are developed. Application of these approaches are limited in Canada due, in part, to lack of detailed scale hazard mapping, and due to the much reduced population density as compared to Europe. However, with increasing interest in pro-active assessment of risk liabilities, and protection of public safety against natural hazards, landslide risk assessment procedures should be applied. 

     The research will include the following general procedure: i) collection of available geological and geotechnical data, ii) field data collection including laser scanning and material property measurement and sampling, iii) development of numerical models to simulate the processes and influence of variation in input parameters, iv) integration of field data and numerical modelling results into a geospatial database, and from the database: v) development of hazard maps and decision support tools for assessing the hazard, vi) evaluation of landslide susceptibility maps, and vii) development of failure consequence assessment procedures. These steps will be applied to large complex landslides, rockfall hazards and sensitive clay slopes. 

     Eight students will work on these projects: 3 currently in program, and 5 new students to be recruited. 75% of the funding will provide student salaries; the balance will support field work and conference attendance.

"Canada's lumber processing industry is a vital contributor to the health of the Canadian economy. In order to maintain its ability to complete in the international market it must continually improve the efficiency with which logs are processed into sawn lumber. Two principal factors must be addressed: the need to minimize the amount of wood lost in saw dust, and the need to increase the speed with which a given log can be converted into sawn boards.

The present research addresses both these isssues. One the one hand research is being conducted into the use of thinner circular saws than have been traditionally used (in order to reduce wastage due to the thickness of the cut); and on the other hand investigations are being conducted into increasing the speed that saws can be operated at (in order to increase the speed that the wood can be fed through the saw). 

Difficulties arise both in using saws that are too thin and in running saws too fast. In such circumstances the blade may deviate excessively and thus cause excessive waste when planed to the required dimensions. The work being conducted seeks to understand the cause of such behaviour through experimental testing and computer modeling. 

The results of laboratory and computer testing will lead to new sawing configurations that will be verified by detailed testing in saw mills.

This equipment request is for an inverted optical microscope and polarized optical microscope. My research program in the emerging field of microfluidics (manipulation of fluids at a micro scale) will use the requested equipment to: (1) fabricate advanced functional microparticles (particles between 0.1 and 100 microns in size) for a variety of uses in biological and environmental applications; and (2) develop miniaturized devices (lab-on-a-chip) to investigate/mimic biological fluidic processes, such as spider silk spinning. These pieces of equipment are key and basic elements to accomplish these objectives.



 The proposed research program will have several significant outcomes, including (i) the creation of novel and advanced microparticles, (ii) the development of new miniaturized devices for advanced microparticles and biologically complex fluids, and (iii) the development of models and the characterization of microstructure formation in micro/nano scales. These outcomes will offer major benefits in diverse fundamental studies and emerging applications, and will accelerate scientific understanding of the formation of microstructures found in nature.

"The program of research proposed herein involves two major themes: (1) Extensions of generalized structured component analysis and (2) regularized fuzzy clusterwise generalizations of statistical methods. 



(1) Extensions of generalized structured component analysis

Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GSCA) (Hwang & Takane, 2004) was proposed as an alternative to traditional approaches to Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Although a variety of extensions and refinements of GSCA have been proposed over the past few years, its analytic capability and generality need to be further improved so as to become a mainstream approach to SEM. Thus, the first theme of the proposed program involves rendering GSCA capable of effectively addressing many advanced SEM issues including nonlinear latent variables, endogenous higher-order latent variables, ridge estimation, and maximum-likelihood estimation. 



(2) Regularized fuzzy clusterwise generalizations of statistical methods

Many statistical methods estimate parameters by pooling the data across observations under the implicit assumption that all observations are sampled from a single homogenous population. Hence, they are not ideally suited for investigating the existence of subgroups of observations which exhibit distinctive response patterns. The second theme of the proposed program aims to generalize three popular statistical methods (generalized linear models, partial least squares regression, and multiple correspondence analysis) so as to take into account such group-level heterogeneity. Each of these methods is combined with regularized fuzzy clustering in a unified framework for capturing this heterogeneity.

"In financial modelling it is assumed that the only information which can be used in decision making is present and past information.  Otherwise, investors would be able to make riskless profits with positive probability.  Mathematical models of financial markets are usually considered ill-posed if they allow for riskless profits with positive probability.   Nevertheless, we recognize that some information about the future behaviour of certain derivative security prices is available to all market participants and must be regarded as a piece of current information.  The simplest example is that the redemption value of a bond is known at issue.



Forward-backward stochastic differential equations are an effective mathematical tool for incorporating present knowledge of, or constraints on, the future behaviour of an asset price in a rigorous fashion while still preserving the restriction that economic agents cannot use future information to make trades which result in riskless profits.  One set of equations models the evolution of the price of an asset (or factors of the economy effecting prices) forward in time based on present and past information. The second set of equations can be viewed as evolving backward in time from a random terminal condition, however, it is constrained to do so in a way that is predictable based on current and past information.  



The research in this proposal applies forward-backward stochastic differential equations to various bonds, futures contracts and forward contracts.  The goal is to extend the existence and uniqueness results for these equations to a wider class of models that better model observed financial data.  We also plan to study the application of these equations to a wider class of derivative securities such as options on bonds, futures, and forwards.  We plan to extend numerical methods for forward-backward equations to a wider class of models

related to the financial applications.

"The proposed research is in two subjects: The first is understanding the processes responsible for earthquakes and mountain building in western Canada and elsewhere.  The second is the occurrence and process of formation of natural marine gas hydrate, especially off western Canada.  (1) In the past 10 years, very high precision GPS measurements have resulted in a revolution in our ability to detect and understand the short-term crustal strain buildup and release associated with earthquakes and the long-term deformation of mountain building.  The deformation responsible for earthquakes in western Canada will be mapped through repeated campaign and continuous very high precision GPS measurements in SW British Columbia, the Queen Charlotte area, and in the Yukon.  The study will include determining the forces that drive the deformation and the variations in the strength in the earth that respond to the deforming forces.  (2) Marine gas hydrates are a frozen form of natural gas that occurs beneath the continental slope in some marine areas such as off Vancouver Island and in the arctic.  It may provide a new source of clean energy, may play a role in climate change, and may be a hazard in conventional oil and gas exploration in deep water and in the arctic.  The study will include marine surveys, and the analyses of data from the recently completed IODP drilling of hydrate off Vancouver Island.","Earth sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Earth and Ocean Sciences, School of","Hyndman, Roy","RGPIN ","Earth science (see also marine geology 4604)","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",3-5
"This research project, a collaboration between Earth scientists from McGill University, the University of Calgary and Commerce Resources Corporation, is designed to produce a detailed understanding of the structural and tectonic evolution of the crust in the Monashee Mountains of the SE Canadian Cordillera.  The rocks in these mountains form part of a late-Precambrian rifted continental margin that was thickened by folding and thrusting during collisional events in the Mesozoic and Tertiary.  They were in the middle crust at the time, and the structures within them formed at temperatures close to melting.  Recent modelling studies have indicated that under these conditions such rocks may flow in channels into regions of lower pressure.  This has been advocated for the Monashees and is supported by variations in metamorphic ages across the region, but it appears to conflict with existing structural interpretations.  We propose a detailed structural study in two well-exposed valleys recently vacated by glaciers, with follow-up metamorphic and geochronological studies, aimed at resolving this apparent conflict.  The Monashees contain abundant carbonatite sills, which are prospective for tantalum and niobium. The sills vary significantly in thickness along their lengths, probably due to the deformation.  Our planned research will provide a better understanding of the causes of thickness variation and will aid the exploration for economically viable deposits.  This study has implications for our understanding of the evolution of the deeper crust in orogens worldwide, and direct bearing on mineral exploration in the region of study and elsewhere.","Earth sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Earth and Planetary Sciences","Hynes, Andrew","CRDPJ ","Structural geology andtectonics","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",2-2

"The continuous use of antibiotics has resulted in multi-resistant bacterial strains. According to the Canadian Bacterial Surveillance Network the rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the main cause of infections such as bronchitis, sinusitis, middle ear infections and pneumonia) resistance to different antibiotics (such as penicillin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin) in Canada over the last 10 years has risen by a factor of 5 to 10. Finding alternatives to synthetic antibiotics is therefore of great importance.

  

  The long term objective of the proposed research program is to investigate one alternative to synthetic antibiotics - Antimicrobial peptides (AMP). The present research program will propose several new approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of antimicrobial peptides, will study a new class of antimicrobial peptides- Latarcins at both molecular and cellular level, and will provide a better understanding of the structure- function relationship for antimicrobial peptides.



  In addition to the advancement of knowledge in the area of protein-membrane interactions, detailed biophysical investigations of AMP could result in the development of new natural antibiotics, and thus will lead to a considerable progress in the treatment of infectious diseases and significant improvement in the quality of health and life.

"How do insects, as tiny animals with large surface to volume ratios that makes water evaporation all the more serious, invade every niche of the terrestrial environment and avoid desiccation? The answer is osmoregulation. The amazing evolutionary adaptations that allow insect to regulate their osmotic state have puzzled researchers for decades. Through my research I will further our understanding of osmoregulation and excretion in insects and the enormous diversity that this group has evolved. This knowledge will uncover not only new aspects of basic insect biology but will facilitate the rational development of cost-effective, insect specific and environmentally benign pest control measures. In addition, my research project will advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of epithelial physiology. One of the most interesting questions on epithelial physiology is the nature of the intracellular homeostatic mechanisms which regulate ion transporters to maintain transepithelial transport while defending cytosolic composition. Insect excretory epithelia are ideal models to study these mechanisms, that have remain elusive so far, thanks to the availability of molecular and physiological approaches not possible in vertebrate models. Funding from this grant will support the training of three graduate and five undergraduate students on molecular biology, advanced electrophysiology and pharmacology that will prepare them for careers in academia and in industry.

"Even though hydrogen possesses the highest energy content per unit weight compared to any of the known

fuels, and burns cleanly, it does not exist in the free form. An economically viable way to obtain hydrogen from

renewable sources will provide a good alternative to the present world-wide reliance on fossil fuels. There is a

huge opportunity to develop the capacity to use components derived from non-purified, non-food biomass

derived feed materials for hydrogen production because this would ease the pressure in using food based

biomass, eliminate the huge amount of energy required for purification, and provide added benefit for

converting wastes to value added products. These components could be derived from non-intensive processes

for conversion of cellulosic materials to oxygenated hydrocarbons (i.e. not specific to ethanol alone) easily at a

low cost. Also, the oxygenated hydrocarbons could be obtained as wastes from biodiesel production. These

multiple sources of oxygenated hydrocarbons ensures that the hydrogen production process can manage

feedstock supply and volatility. Furthermore, in order to derive an additional advantage from the use of

biomass materials to achieve huge environmental benefits, CO2 capture must be incorporated in the process.

This will ensure that we not merely achieve a net zero emissions, but actually use the process to extract CO2

that already exists in the atmosphere. Our objectives are to: (i) develop a high performance catalyst for the

reforming of any non-food or waste biomass derived crude mixtures of liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons

including higher alcohols, organic acids, glycerol, etc., (ii) develop the process conditions as well as integration

and optimization strategies for the process, and (iii) develop and incorporate a CO2 capture strategy for the

production of the cleanest fuel, hydrogen.","Energy efficiency","Energy resources","Engineering, Faculty of","Idem, Raphael","STPGP ","Chemical engineering","Chemical engineering","G�nie chimique",3-3

During the tenure period of the present grant our research will be concerned with the study of such fundamental processes as proton transfer reactions in bulk aqueous solutions and at water/biological membrane interfaces.



The importance of the proposed research stems not only from advancing our knowledge of ubiquitous physico-chemical processes, but also from its potential applicability in important industrial fields including computer-assisted drug design. In addition, the present research program will enable students working in our group to develop technical and scientific skills useful in various fields such as information technology, nanotechnology, pharmaceutical and computer science. Last, but not least, an important part of our research efforts will be directed toward developing new and more powerful computational software capable of simulating intricate condensed phase transformations.

"Anaerobiosis is one of the widespread and damaging stresses. Plants experience it on flooded and compact soils which occupy large areas in Canada. Oxygen deficiency arises due to its low solubility and low diffusion rate in water and damages mostly roots and seeds. It has been known for many years that nitrate has ameliorating effect on flooded crops but the exact mechanism of this phenomenon is not understood to date. The proposal aims to establish novel functions for plant mitochondria connected with their functionality under hypoxic conditions via increased involvement in nitrogen metabolism and in particular in nitrate/nitrite/nitric oxide turnover. Through this research program, I seek to understand the molecular mechanism by which plant mitochondria switch from the use of oxygen to the reduction of nitrite followed by nitric oxide production.  I will explore the possibility of mitochondrial contribution to ATP synthesis in low oxygen environments, leading to the maintenance of cell energy status during hypoxia and to the decreased production of ethanol and lactic acid. The pathway of removal of toxic nitric oxide via reactions involving the hypoxically induced hemoglobin will be studied. My research program will have immediate and far-reaching impacts on fundamental processes of plant adaptation. Mitochondria as major components of the defense system under hypoxia represent a new potential target for improving resistance to stress in plants. Proving the operation of anaerobic mitochondrial ATP synthesis as an alternative to classic fermentation pathways will make it possible to develop strategies to cope with negative consequences of anaerobic events in plant systems and select flood-tolerant crops.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Biology,"Igamberdiev, Abir","RGPIN ","Stress physiology","Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",2-5

"Killer T lymphocytes are important mediators of autoimmune diseases, but they must be activated before they can induce tissue damage. In most cases of autoimmune diseases, it remains unknown what triggers the ability of potentially self-reactive T cells to damage healthy tissues. Current evidence suggests that appropriate genetic and environmental factors must interact in certain ways to stimulate potentially self-destructive killer T cells. One of these environmental factors is thought to be microbial pathogens. Certain viruses and bacteria are believed to be associated with the initiation, progression and exacerbation of autoimmune diseases. However, pathogens implicated in one single autoimmune disease may be very diverse and have nothing in common. This implies that pathogens per se may not directly induce autoimmune diseases. Therefore, we speculate that certain factors that are similarly affected by different pathogens might underlie various pathogen-associated autoimmune diseases. We have observed that one group of inflammatory factors induced by microbes, called cytokines, can  activate killer T cells in an unconventional manner and increase their reactivity to body's own tissues. In this project, we investigate how cytokines aberrantly boost the ability of killer T cells to recognize and kill healthy tissues leading to autoimmune diseases.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","M�decine","Ilangumaran, Subburaj","RGPIN ","Signal transduction","Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",1-5

"L'�nergie �olienne conna�t une croissance importante au Canada et dans le monde � cause du co�t relativement faible de production et de ses avantages �conomiques, environnementaux et sociaux. Cependant, le Canada fait face � des d�fis particuliers dans le d�veloppement de cette fili�re �nerg�tique principalement � cause des caract�ristiques climatiques comme le froid et le givrage ainsi que du retard technologique par rapport � l'Europe et les �tats-Unis. En consid�rant le portrait technologique actuel, Industrie Canada et Ressources Naturelles Canada ont identifi� comme opportunit�s prioritaires l'adaptation des turbines �oliennes aux conditions nordiques ainsi que l'utilisation des petites �oliennes pour le couplage �olien-diesel. Le programme de recherche propos� comporte deux projets r�pondant directement � ces cr�neaux majeurs de R&D : 

1.    )	L'�tude du givrage des pales a comme objectif de d�velopper des proc�dures et techniques pour identifier les conditions d'apparition du givrage, d�terminer son impact sur les instruments de mesure, sur les turbines et sur la perte de production d'un parc �olien et d'adapter des techniques de d�givrage aux pales d'�oliennes. 

2.    )	Le d�veloppement de syst�mes �olien-diesel avec stockage d'air comprim� a comme objectif de faire la R&D permettant la conception et la fabrication de ce type de centrales �lectriques.

L'approche m�thodologique propos�e combine la mod�lisation sur ordinateur, les tests en laboratoires et les exp�rimentations sur site, permettant une excellente formation des �tudiants impliqu�s dans les projets. Les projets r�pondent aux besoins d'une industrie en pleine explosion et fait partie d'une programmation strat�gique impliquant plusieurs universit�s et centres de recherche. L'objectif vis� par ce plan strat�gique est de permettre aux chercheurs et � l'industrie canadienne de devenir des leaders mondiaux dans l'exploitation de l'�nergie �olienne en conditions nordiques. Le grand int�r�t des �tudiants pour l'�olien nous permet de croire que ce projet permettra de r�pondre aux besoins urgents de main d'oeuvre de l'industrie.

"Dans le contexte actuel, les besoins �nerg�tiques sont en forte augmentation. En tenant compte que la consommation mondiale d'�nergie d�pend actuellement pour environ 80% des combustibles fossiles et que leur combustion conduit � des �missions importantes de CO2 dans l'atmosph�re, l'accroissement continu de la concentration atmosph�rique des gaz � effet de serre (GES) (notamment le CO2) est consid�r� le facteur principal qui provoque l'ind�sirable r�chauffement du climat. La capture et le stockage du CO2 commencent � prendre progressivement de l'importance dans le programme de r�duction des �missions de GES. C'est la capture du CO2 qui fait l'objet de ce programme de recherche. Des solutions technologiques novatrices de capture du CO2 priorisant une r�duction importante de l'�nergie n�cessaire pour la capture permettront donc de rendre cette �tape abordable pour la plupart des installations industrielles. 



Notre objectif g�n�ral � long terme vise le d�veloppement de nouveaux proc�d�s hybrides membranaires de s�paration et de capture du CO2 des �missions d'origine industrielle qui seront en mesure de r�duire d'une mani�re significative les couts engendr�s.

A court-terme, notre objectif sera centr� sur la premi�re direction. Nous consid�rons ici : (a) la s�lection de nouveaux absorbants � base d'amines � encombrement st�rique, (b) la synth�se de nouvelles membranes microporeuses hautement hydrophobes � base de polyimides fluorur�s, (c) l'�tude de la compatibilit� absorbant/membrane, ainsi que (d) l'�tude des performances des modules d'absorption.

"The subsurface is heterogeneous at multiple scales and this is the rule rather than the exception. Information about spatial variability of flow and transport parameters is most commonly obtained through geostatistical analysis of small-scale measurements. Despite its common use, it is unclear whether the geostatistical approach can preserve geological features, their connectivity and morphology which can have large impacts on fluid flow and more importantly, contaminant transport. We have recently made significant strides in mapping hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific storage (Ss) heterogeneity using hydraulic tomography. Hydraulic tomography involves the sequential pumping of water from packed-off intervals and the corresponding monitoring of head change information in straddle-packer systems in nearby boreholes. Pumping and collection of head change data in a tomographic manner allows one to obtain information on the propagation of pressure changes through the aquifer from various directions. This information is then used in a stochastic inverse model that computes K and Ss tomograms. Hydraulic tomography experiments performed in the laboratory by our group show that it can image the distributions of K and Ss as well as their connectivity considerably better than kriging. The approach has been recently extended to include partitioning tracer transport information to image the locations of Dense Nonaqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL) saturations in 3-D. Preliminary results show that DNAPL saturations and their pools can be imaged accurately. Accurate imaging of DNAPL saturations in source zones will considerably improve our abilities to remediate thousands of sites in Canada and beyond. The proposed research focuses on conducting complementary experimental and computational investigations that should significantly advance our capabilities to map subsurface heterogeneity and contaminant source zones in complex geologic media. Development of these capabilities will also allow us to significantly advance our fundamental understanding of flow and transport processes in such media.

"Data generated by modern applications such as object tracking, RFID databases, sensor networks, and Web data integration generate data that involves uncertainty, and various anomalies such as missing values and duplication. While many research efforts have been focusing on data cleaning and dealing with inconsistent databases, very limited research has focused on enabling information retrieval queries and data exploration in probabilistic and uncertain databases. 



This proposal aims primarily at allowing users to effectively query and explore large volumes of inconsistent and uncertain databases. I will focus in this proposal on two main research directions: first, allowing information retrieval style queries such as ranking, preference handling, and aggregation in the context of uncertain databases; and second, developing declarative data cleaning approaches based on probabilistic modeling of erroneous and inconsistent data.  The proposed techniques will be tested in QualityDB, a probabilistic database engine prototype we are currently building, based on an open-source DBMS. The goal is to build a generic framework that adapts to different probabilistic data models, and encapsulates efficient query processing algorithms to allow for pipelined execution guided by data quality measures. Towards this goal, the proposed research plan has a set of short-term and long-term tasks. Short-term tasks include the following: (1) revising current query semantics to integrate ranking and aggregation queries along with probabilistic semantics; (2) extending the capabilities of current relational database engines to support storage and efficient retrieval of probabilistic data; and (3) developing declarative query language for specifying user-defined quality guarantees that guide the retrieval, processing and cleaning of dirty raw data. The long-term research tasks address integrating this framework into broader data management environments including Web search and document retrieval in XML and text databases.

"This proposal seeks financial support for the investigation of a variety of quantum materials in McMaster Low-Temperature High-Field Laboratory (Mac LTHF Lab).  A main thrust of our research program is that we have in-house experimental capabilities of both microscopic and macroscopic measurements, including NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), resistivity and ac susceptibility, in combined extreme conditions of low temperatures (down to 9mK), high magnetic fields (up to 16 Tesla), and high pressures (up to 3 GPa).    



I founded Mac LTHF Lab in 2002 in the Brockhouse Institute for Materials Research with funding from NSERC, CFI (Canadian Foundation for Innovation), OIT (Ontario Innovation Trust), NEDO (Japan) and McMaster, with the total budget exceeding $1,000,000.  Over the last 5 years, my research group has invested a large amount of time and financial resources to build up the infrastructure to generate combined extreme experimental conditions.  We are ready to move into a new phase to harvest scientific discoveries.  Our experimental capabilities are quite rare, and we have positioned ourselves as one of the few NMR research groups in the world with such extraordinary experimental capabilities.     



In the coming 5 year funding period, we plan to focus on three sets of goals: (a) NMR investigation of spin-liquid, such as NaxCoO2 and Kagome-lattice systems; (b) search for pressure and/or field induced phase transitions in NaxCoO2 and other materials, based on charge transport, ac susceptibility, and/or NMR measurements; and (c) NMR experiments on new exquisite samples of high Tc superconductors.

"Vehicle efficiency (in terms of fuel consumption) and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions continues to be a major challenge. The weight of automobiles can be reduced by using high-strength steels as long as they have the essential ductility required in metal forming operations. Furthermore, light metal alloys (magnesium and aluminum) are of considerable interest to automobile manufacturers because of their low densities and the appreciable weight (and energy) savings that would result from increased use. However, the lower ductility of light metal alloys compared to steel continues to remain a bottleneck for widespread replacement of steel by light metals. Ductility is a microstructure and temperature-sensitive property and enhancement of the ductility of light metals (such as aluminum and magnesium) and high-strength steels (such as dual phase steels) could be achieved through microstrucutural control. The proposed research will combine the latest advancements in the field of micromechanics (advanced realistic material models), finite element methods and supercomputing (parallel computing) for the ultimate goal of numerically engineering microstructures that present the necessary formability desired for any given metal forming operation. 

The proposed research will provide  excellent opportunities for graduate student training. The students will develop an excellent understanding of the basic concepts of large strain plasticity and special knowledge in the field of crystal plasticity and microstructure based numerical modeling of metal formability. Moreover, the student will acquire excellent computing skills, especially in the field of parallel computing and its applications to metal forming.

"The long term objective of my research is to develop a better understanding of mountain building processes by investigating the architecture and the pressure-temperature-time (P-T-t) evolution of exposed orogenic cores. This proposal focuses on the metamorphic evolution and tectonic significance of granulites from two large orogens separated in time by ~1000 My: the deeply eroded Mesoproterozoic Grenville Province (central segment; Quebec) in which the orogenic core (hinterland) is widely exposed, and the modern Himalaya-Tibet system (Namche Barwa, eastern Himalayan syntaxis) in which exposure of core units is limited. 

Granulites are high temperature metamorphic rocks that typically occur in core zones of ""hot"" orogens and include pelitic rocks that have undergone substantial partial melting. The P-T-(t) evolution of such rocks is a direct response of thermal and tectonic processes operating in the orogenic crust. Recent developments in phase equilibria modeling, combined with careful examination of textures, allows for much improved determination of the P-T evolution of granulites, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.  

The proposed approach involves: (a) geological mapping and sampling; (b) phase equilibria modeling of granulites to  interpret textures and mineral chemistry in terms of P-T paths and deduce the tectonic environments of metamorphism ; (c) investigation of the textural setting and metamorphic reactions involving accessory minerals (apatite and monazite) that are relevant to P-T-(t) studies; (c) geochemistry and U-Pb geochronology to elucidate the nature of the original rocks that make up the hinterland of the central Grenville, their ages and the ages of metamorphism (in collaboration with others at MUN).

The results will provide insights on the dynamics of middle to lower orogenic crust and on partial melting of crustal rocks in continental collision settings.

"Mathematical control theory provides a theoretical basis for the design and analysis of automatic control systems implemented by engineers.  These control systems are ubiquitous in modern life, playing an essential role in automobiles and CD players,  aircraft and satellites.  My research is directed toward a non-traditional use of these ideas: the application of control theory to the emerging discipline of 'systems biology.'  This interdisciplinary field is devoted to the elucidation of the biochemical networks that molecular biologists are uncovering within the cell.  Many of these biochemical networks have regulatory roles, and incorporate the same feedback concepts that control engineers use in their designs.  By drawing analogies between man-made control systems and biochemical regulatory networks, we can aid in the task of describing the biological functions of the networks.  The result will be an improved understanding of cellular behaviour, in both natural and perturbed environments.  This knowledge will allow enhanced manipulation of living organisms for the purposes of pharmaceutic design, metabolic engineering, biotechnology, and environmental and agricultural improvements.

"Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometry of solutions spaces of polynomials in several variables.  This includes the geometry of familiar shapes like parabolas, spheres, and curves in the plane defined by a polynomial.  One tries to study the solutions by relating them to other spaces via mappings or parametrizations.  This subject is highly controlled by the algebra of polynomials.  Geometric statements about the space of solutions correspond directly to algebraic statements about the polynomials one is solving.  

In noncommutative algebra the order of the product yields different answers.  So xy is not equal to yx.  However, one can do the same type of algebra that is done with polynomials for geometric purposes.  This algebra is motivated by geometric problems and intuition.  It is called noncommutative algebraic geometry.  It uses the techniques and ideas of commutative algebraic geometry applied to noncommutative algebra.  For example we may try to solve noncommutative equations with matrices and try to understand that space of solutions.  More concretely, the equation yx-xy=1 has no matrix solutions, but the equation yx+xy=0 has many.  We wish to understand the space of solutions.  In addition to having immediate applications in noncommutative algebra, there are applications to algebraic geometry.  Important spaces that arise in algebraic geometry can be described as solutions of noncommutative equations with matrices.  The proposed research deals with the spaces were this interaction occurs.  One important problem is to know when we can parametrize the solutions spaces.  For example, the points on the parabola y equal x squared are parametrized by x=t, y equals t squared, but it is impossible to parametrize the solutions of y squared equals x cubed minus one, with polynomials.  We have a geometric conditions that should characterize when one can parametrize the matrix solutions of certain types of noncommutative equations.  We will try to prove that these conditions do indeed hold true.

"Ice Syrup� is a novel, uniquely Canadian food product produced from Icewine grapes. The juice that is

pressed from naturally frozen grapes is further concentrated through a patent-pending process that results in a

syrup highly concentrated in sugar, acids and flavour compounds. However, stability issues have arisen with

the syrup in the form of undesirable precipitated compounds after bottling. The exact nature of the precipitate

is unknown, but several possibilities exist that must be resolved for Ice Syrup� production to continue as a

high quality Canadian product. This project is designed to first identify the compounds precipitating from the

syrup, then investigate which step(s) of the production process are causing the product instability to understand

the mechanism of precipitate formation, and lastly to develop methods that can be implemented in the

production process to prevent future product instability while at the same time, ensuring that the final product

is of the highest taste, aroma and visual quality. Because Ice Syrup� is a non-alcohol based food product with

many downstream applications in the food industry, it brings a new level of diversity to the Canadian grape

industry, further contributing to the sustainability of this agriculture sector, with new job creation for the syrup

operation, preventing job loss in local grape growing operations, and finding a productive use of surplus grapes

in Ontario. Ice Syrup� is truly a new Canadian innovative food product that could have a significant global

"The task of maintaining upright stance in the human involves a complex motor control system that has to use and integrate sensory information from primarily three sensory sources: the vestibular system, the somatosensory system, and the visual system.  The LONG TERM GOAL of my basic research program is to better understand the fundamental role played by these sensory inputs in the control of standing balance, locomotion and movement in humans.  To continue with this direction of work, two main concentration areas or lines of research will be carried out over the next 5 years. The SHORT TERM goal of the first main concentration area of research will focus on the influence of two descending motor pathways that are directly influenced by these sensory systems, on the regulation of single motorneurons of postural muscles in standing human subjects. To look at single motorneuron behaviour, we have developed long term recordings of single motor units, using custom built and extremely stable indwelling wire recording electrodes. The influence of vestibulospinal and reticulospinal inputs onto single motor units recorded during quiet stance will be investigated. Vestibular inputs will be modulated using Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS), while reticulospinal inputs will be modulated using loud acoustic stimuli to activate the Audiospinal Reflex (ASR). The SHORT TERM goal of the second main concentration area will investigate the regulation of the human muscle spindles (muscle stretch receptors) utilizing a research technique termed microneurography. We plan to investigate the response profile of muscle spindles of the lower limb during realistic physiological active and passive muscle lengthening and shortening. These recordings will be first recorded in sitting subjects, and pilot experiments have demonstrated that, although very difficult, it is possible to record from the single axons from muscle spindles in ankle dorsiflexors in quietly standing human subjects, even during standing perturbations (ankle plantar/dorsiflexion).

"The research program focuses on developing mathematical models and algorithms to predict and optimize performance of service systems, with particular emphasis on Emergency Medical Services and call centres.  Services employ the majority of the workforce in Canada (over 75%) and other developed economies.  Productivity, by most measures, is considerably lower in services than other sectors, so there are clear opportunities for performance improvement in services.  The health care sector forms a large and growing portion of the service sector and is a prime source of interesting and important planning problems.  Health care problems are important not only in economic terms but also because of the potential of improved planning to save lives or increase the quality of life of patients.  The researcher will employ statistical methods, queueing theory, stochastic modeling, and optimization algorithms to develop improved methods to plan resource allocation in service systems.

"My research in number theory deals largely with problems coming from dynamical systems.  In particular, my research deals with questions of the following form: given a rational function and some initial value (a rational number), what are the arithmetic properties of the sequence of numbers generated by repeatedly applying the function to the initial value.  For example, if a sequence of this form falls into a repeating cycle, one would like to know how long such a cycle might be, given some information about the function.  One the other hand, if the sequence never repeats, then the ""heights"" of the terms (essentially the number of digits in numerator and denominator of these rational numbers) grow at an exponential rate.  One significant problem in the area, one which I have made some progress on, and plan to research further, is to obtain explicit lower bounds on the exact rate of this exponential growth, for certain families of rational functions.  This research has implications in various areas of number theory (to elliptic curves, recurrence sequences, etc.), as well as to problems in dynamics, computation, and mathematical logic.","Mathematical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Pure Mathematics","Ingram, Patrick","RGPIN ","Number theory","Pure mathematics","Math�matiques pures",1-5

"Many computer systems nowadays require verbal or textual interaction with the users. Examples of such systems are interactive training simulations (serious games), service robots, and automatic help desks. Traditionally, the sentences used for these interactions are written manually. The use of software that could automatically generate these sentences would enable the systems to adapt the expressed messages to the context of the conversation, and express past and future actions that may form these interactions. Such software implements a Natural Language Generation (NLG) process. For example, DISTIL Interactive creates business interview games which can range from simple sales calls to business audits or complex negotiations. Creating the dialogue for these interviews is a current bottleneck. An NLG system that can create realistic dialogue for the intelligent conversational agents can alleviate this bottle-neck and reduce the high human-labour cost. With such a technological solution, a writer can sketch out the skeleton of the dialogue and then the NLG component can create many different responses based on a defined set of rules. In addition, the use of NLG will permit to enrich the dialogue by automatically modifying the responses according to the character's personality, mood, and tone. 



We already have a first proof-of-concept NLG system. In this project we propose to extend it in order to allow the creation of text with more individual personalities and emotions. We propose a new line of research in text analysis and text generations. The results of text analysis by automatic classification (machine learning) and information extraction will be used directly in the text generation phase. We are investigating ways of discovering emotions and tone patterns from text and integrating them in the NLG process that assists the dialogue content generation. We also propose to provide a tool that aids the human experts to build dialogue content templates to be used by the previously mentioned systems.","Information systems and technology","Information and communication services","Information Technology and Engineering, School of","Inkpen, Diana","STPGP ","Natural language and speech understanding","Artificial intelligence","Intelligence artificielle",1-2
"Existing search engines allow a user to retrieve useful information from texts on the Internet, but not from audio documents such as broadcast news or other recordings. The user has to browse through long audio recordings to find relevant parts. Despite much progress both in commercial applications and in research prototypes that deal with natural language, their performance of information retrieval systems still needs to be improved. We propose new ways of combining symbolic and statistical methods for dealing with the meaning of words and sentences. We plan to apply them in several tasks where they have not yet been tried. In particular, we propose to apply semantic similarity methods to tasks in Information Retrieval, Automatic Speech Recognition, and Computer Assisted Language Learning. We focus on multiple languages and on cross-language techniques.

       Information Retrieval from spoken documents can take advantage of a standard text-based IR system if a speech recognition system converts speech into written text. Speech recognizers, however, introduce a high error rate. We propose to correct automatic transcripts using semantic similarity methods. We also investigate techniques of improving the overall retrieval efficiency from spoken documents in a multilingual setting.

       Existing Computer-Assisted Language Learning tools do not give a student enough feedback to allow them to increase the learning rate. We propose extensions of such tools that include automatically-produced exercises with false friends and cognate words. Cognates are words that have similar spellings and meanings in different languages. They can help a second-language learner in the tasks of vocabulary expansion and reading comprehension. The learner also needs to pay attention to false friends: pairs of words that appear similar but have in fact different meanings in some or all contexts. Another automated tool that we propose is a semantic corrector that assists a second-language writer by detecting wrong usage of words in context.

"Multiphase flow in porous media is encountered in a great variety of engineering applications.  Whereas the time evolution and spatial structure of fluid saturation depends on the applied pressure gradient or fluid injection rate, viscosity ratio, microscopic structure, macroscopic heterogeneity and relative affinity of the fluid phases for the solid surface (wettability), description of multiphase flow in porous media continues to rely on a continuum phenomenological equation (multiphase Darcy's law), which introduces the relative permeability and capillary pressure functions.  The measurement and subsequent interpretation of these functions in terms of pore-scale physics under dynamic conditions is still the subject of considerable debate.



The proposed research program will capitalize on our recent discovery that the relative permeability of a strongly wetting phase can be determined directly from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, without recourse to Darcy's law.  In a series of experiments we will measure, using NMR relaxometry and imaging, relative permeability for a number of dynamic two-phase flow processes,  including free and forced drainage and imbibition in granular, fibrous and consolidated porous media of strong, intermediate and mixed wettability. We will exploit the potential of NMR techniques to determine not simply fluid content, but also the average size of pore spaces in which fluid phases are confined, and to do so with 3D spatial resolution.  It is precisely the sensitivity of nuclear magnetization to geometric confinement that provides a means to correlate NMR relaxation parameters with dynamic flow functions.  It is the local nature of NMR measurements which makes it feasible to study porous media with macroscopic heterogeneities and we will study both stratified and vuggy porous media.  Simulations using continuum and pore-scale models will be used to solidify the interpretation of experimental measurements.  The results will have a large impact on our ability to predict the outcome of dynamic immiscible displacement in porous materials of broad engineering interest.

"There is a growing trend toward the use of ubiquitous devices (devices for information access anytime-and-anywhere) such as PDAs and cell phones.

"Visual impairment is a highly feared disability. However, the eyes and visual system appear to be capable of both functional and structural adaptation to a variety of environmental influences. This means that there is the potential to favorably alter outcomes and thus prevent or reduce visual impairment. The long-term objective of this research is to understand the developmental processes of vision and the visual system and the extent to which these processes can be altered by visual experience or adaptation. To understand the normal developmental process one must be able to measure the visual functions in question. This is not always easy and some populations are more difficult to evaluate than others. One of my main goals therefore is to measure visual functions such as acuity and eye movements in populations that typically have been neglected, such as children and the elderly. It is essential that the normal variation with age be known in order that it may be distinguished from the case of disorder. We wish to know this so that when either intentional or inadvertent intervention interrupts the normal course of events we can predict with some confidence the outcome or possibly even alter it. A second goal is to study the effects of altered visual experience/adaptation on eye development and/or visual performance.

These kinds of experiments have potential in evaluating visual capabilities and requirements for a variety of every day tasks such as reading, driving, and sports. They may affect how children are taught, the criterion for the diagnosis of disease as well as rehabilitation. Myopia (near-sightedness) is estimated to affect 30% of the North American population and up to 90% of Asian populations. In some cases the increase in prevalence has occurred within a single generation suggesting that the change has occurred as the result of environmental influences. We are altering the visual environment to study the adaptive mechanisms of the eye. This is done in order to understand the basic mechanisms which underlie the development of refractive errors. The ultimate aim is to use this information to develop strategies for prevention or reversal of these errors.

"The primary focus of this project is the general problem of decomposing (or factoring) a permutation into a product of others.  Permutation factorizations arise in many interesting and diverse contexts; for instance, they are intimately connected with the representation theory of the symmetric group, combinatorial topology (viz. embeddings of graphs on surfaces), singularity theory, algebraic geometry, and physics.



This research program will investigate the algebraic and combinatorial structure of permutation factorizations, with a focus on enumerative aspects.  Counting minimal length ""transitive"" decompositions of permutations into transposition factors is of particular interest, since this problem is known to be equivalent to the enumeration of almost simple branched coverings of the sphere by the sphere.  It has recently been linked to the intersection theory of the moduli space of curves.  The goal is to understand the combinatorics underlying transitive factorizations, motivated by their compelling rich structure and the long term hope that a deeper understanding will shed light on the associated geometry.  



To this end, connections between factorizations and well known combinatorial objects such as trees and parking functions will be studied. From an algebraic viewpoint, permutation factorization is at the heart of the representation theory of the symmetric group.  (Indeed, counting factorizations is equivalent to determining the structure constants of the central subalgebra of the group algebra.)  The algebraic aspects of permutation factorizations (as well as factorizations in other Coxeter groups) will be explored.

"The research groups of Dr. Darren Irwin and Dr. Dolph Schluter are internationally recognized for their innovative approaches to studying evolutionary ecology. Much of their research involves analysis of genetic samples collected from organisms in the wild. By extracting and analyzing DNA from these samples, researchers are able to learn a great deal about the processes that produce and maintain biodiversity. Central to this research is the ability to store DNA samples at extremely cold temperatures, around -80 degrees centigrade, which prevents degradation of the DNA. The two research groups currently store samples in two ultracold freezers, but these freezers are now filled to capacity due to rapid growth in the number and scope of research projects, due both to increasing numbers of graduate students and postdocs as well as growing international collaborations. The grant would enable the purchase of two new ultracold freezers, enabling the research to continue.

"The deterioration of reinforced concrete (RC) structures due to steel corrosion is a major concern for infrastructure owners and operators.  Therefore, accurate monitoring of reinforcement corrosion in concrete structures using non-destructive tests (NDTs) is critically important for assessing their durability and long-term performance, and for prioritizing and budgeting maintenance/repair operations.  Although significant progress has been made during the last two decades, existing NDTs still lack the necessary accuracy and reliability to detect and to characterize steel corrosion in RC structures.  The challenges associated with these methods can be explained by (1) the black-box nature of RC, (2) highly variable and complex nature of the chemical and physical properties of concrete, (3) dense reinforcement detailing in structural members, and (4) inherent problems associated with the corrosion measurement techniques. The main goal of the proposed research is to use inverse modelling and optimization techniques that combine spatially sparse field measurement data with the strength of numerical modelling to develop an innovative approach to the monitoring of steel corrosion in RC structures.  Accurate numerical simulations that are based on inverse modelling and optimization algorithms combined with relatively infrequent, and hence inexpensive, non-destructive measurements has the potential to revolutionize the corrosion monitoring of RC infrastructure.  The proposed research is expected to pave the way to the development of the next generation of corrosion measurement devices for RC structures.  These new model-assisted NDTs will have a significant impact on the early detection of corrosion-induced structural safety issues and will considerably reduce costs by helping engineers more accurately manage, prioritize and budget maintenance/repair operations. The students involved in these projects will be equipped to contribute to the safety assessment of Canada's critical infrastructure.

"The evolution of human civilization is synonymous with how it meets its energy needs. Few would dispute the human race has become progressively more civilized with time. This would mean less energy is required per capita to sustain life today than, say, 50 years ago. Unfortunately, exactly the opposite has happened. Whereas we used to know that resources were infinite, and human needs finite, today we are told: resources are finite, human needs are infinite.  What's going on? The proposed research is aimed at answering this fundamental question.  Taking up petroleum fluids as its principal topic, the research focuses on rendering petroleum operations sustainable, and proposes to overcome the following difficulties: 1) insufficient description of solid/liquid interaction, particularly under thermal constraints; 2) casting of rock and fluid data on 'ideal' models (non-existent in nature); and 3) linearization of governing equations that are inherently non-linear. An experimental program will be developed to eliminate some shortcomings in existing laboratory techniques commonly used in petroleum research. Instead of fitting (or retrofitting) to an 'ideal' model (even after revisions to include 'non-ideality'), newly developed mathematical models that emulate natural phenomena will be fed these experimental results. These models will be a continuous function of time - the most important feature of a natural phenomenon, and included in a comprehensive mass, momentum, and energy balance equation.  Techniques recently developed (and published) by the applicant will be used to solve the resulting non-linear equations. These methods do not employ linearization and solve problems with the provision of tracking multiple solutions. The resulting numerical models will become valuable tools for prediction of petroleum reservoir performance under various recovery schemes. This feature will be demonstrated through scaling up results and comparing with conventional simulators. Owing to its closer-to-reality predictions alone, this feature should translate into millions of dollars in savings. This study has the potential of revolutionizing engineering practices, particularly in the petroleum sector.

"A partnership between researchers in the Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry of McGill University and Varian Canada Inc. has been formed to develop new technology for the rapid, automated identification of foodborne bacteria. Foodborne illnesses remain very common occurrences, with more than 40% of the Canadian population being afflicted each year according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. From a public health perspective, such illnesses not only can constitute a serious health risk, primarily for the very young, the infirm, and the elderly, but also represent a substantial burden on the healthcare system, taking up increasingly scarce resources that could otherwise be applied toward other health concerns. In economic terms, foodborne illnesses are a leading cause of lost productivity, and the associated costs combined with medical expenses have been estimated to reach $1.3 billion/yr in Canada. Various species of bacteria are responsible for a large proportion of foodborne illnesses, and the availability of rapid, cost-effective methods to identify these species is important to both public health agencies and the food industry. In this CRD project, a new identification technology based on the use of infrared imaging spectroscopy to ""fingerprint"" bacteria will be developed. A database or ""spectral library"" containing the infrared spectral fingerprints of approximately 200 strains of common foodborne bacteria will be created, and data analysis algorithms will be developed to allow for identification of bacteria isolated from food by matching of their spectral fingerprints against those in the database. In addition, a standardized experimental protocol will be established, and infrared image acquisition, processing, and interpretation will be automated so that this technique can be routinely employed in microbiological analysis laboratories. The integrated system will be evaluated by researchers at Health Canada's regional (Quebec) laboratory. The successful completion of this three-year project will provide those responsible for food safety with a new and powerful tool for the rapid identification of foodborne bacteria.

"Proteins in foods are important not only from a nutritional perspective but also as functional ingredients because of their ability to form gels, stabilize emulsions, bind water, and act as thickening agents. These functional properties are directly related to protein conformation, but a detailed understanding of these relationships in complex food systems is lacking. In our work, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is being employed to study changes in protein conformation that may occur under the conditions to which proteins are exposed during processing and storage and to relate these changes to changes in protein functionality. Specific aspects of this research program that will be further advanced include the investigation of conformational changes of food proteins subjected to high pressure (UHP), ultrahigh temperature (UHT), and microwave treatments, which are increasingly being employed in food processing. In addition, with the recent acquisition of an IR microscope equipped with a focal-plane-array (FPA) detector (courtesy of an NSERC Research Tools and Instruments Grant), the applicant will develop new FTIR methodologies for time-resolved studies of protein dynamics, protein-protein interactions, and the responses of proteins to pH and temperature changes, metal ions, sugars, solvents, denaturants, and ligands. For this purpose, a rapid-mixer microfluidic device has been designed and will serve as a versatile tool for monitoring conformational changes in proteins with a time resolution on the submillisecond time scale. Altogether, the basic exploratory nature of this five-year research program suits the NSERC Discovery mandate and should not only contribute substantively to the understanding of the behavior of important food proteins that will assist the food industry in making more effective use of these proteins but will also provide us and other researchers with new tools to address questions of fundamental biochemical significance.

"In most industrialized countries, the industry sector represents one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for undesired global warming and climate change. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is by far the most significant of the GHG emissions. Emissions of CO2 have increased substantially in recent years, resulting in a higher level of CO2 in the atmosphere. For example, Canada's 2004 GHG emissions increased by approximately 27% from its 1990 levels. Both the current strict regulations, such as the Kyoto Protocol that Canada ratified, and the anticipated more stringent emission standards of the future impose technological challenges on the Canadian industry, and other sectors, in order to meet the requirements for mitigating the GHG emissions. The proposed research will ultimately benefit Canada at the three main levels, (1) Political: by offering additional options in meeting current and future national and international regulations on reducing GHG emissions; (2) Economical: by offering the Canadian industry a promising technology for removal of CO2 for emissions control, that in turn will benefit the country's economy; and (3) Environmental: by reducing CO2 emissions from the country's atmosphere. The proposed research would also effectively promote training of undergraduate and graduate students at Lakehead University. The short-term objectives of the proposal over the next five years are focused to establish fundamental and comprehensive understanding of the use of membrane CO2 removal technology for industrial emissions control applications. These objectives include, (1) investigate the effects of CO2 concentration of a simulated flue gas stream on the performance characteristics of potential types of membrane devices under isothermal operating conditions; (2) characterize the effects of non-isothermal operating conditions of a simulated flue gas stream on the performance of the membrane devices; (3) characterize CO2 separation from actual flue gas streams generated from combustion-based sources and simulate the performance of a potential device over a wide range of operating conditions; and (4) perform parametric and optimization analyses to propose an advanced CO2 membrane removal device.

"Recent work by the applicant has been concerned with dealing with some of the performance and QoS (quality of service) issues which exist in current Internet, particularly for inelastic applications that are sensitive to delay and packet loss. The current Internet was originally designed to support flat, elastic, applications which are relatively insensitive to delay and where packet losses could be handled by retransmissions. Modern applications, such as video streaming and collaborative work require timely delivery and a QoS assurance level. Long propagation delays, by itself, makes retransmission infeasible in many cases and forwarding delays due to congestion and poor routing compound the problem Furthermore, services on the current Internet are network centric, whereas modern needs are more user/application centric. Thus, in recent years the applicant has done work on web caching, load sensitive dynamic routing, multicasting, discard policies for QoS maintenance in transport of MPEG streams, routing improvement in DHT-based P2P networks, simulation tools for large scale networks, route failure recovery for reserved routing.

     The proposed research will continue the research on improvement of routing performance and to provisioning of QoS. The results are intended to improve the performance of the current Internet as well as to experiment with ideas that might be used in the Internet of the future. The approach being taken is more user/ application centric than currently exists and also moving more intelligence inside the network, whereas the current Internet paradigm is to keep compute power and intelligence at the edges of the network.

     For example, our current research on routing improvement in DHT based P2P networks is focused on fixed end points. Extension of the work will be sought to handle more mobile clients. The work on route failure recovery for reserved routing has focused on avoidance of a few simple classes of links. Extensions to other classes of links and the trade-offs between computational/state requirements and performance will be investigated

"We all learn and most of us tend to be quite good at doing so. The more amazing thing about learning is that the brain allows for the memory of events we learn about to be remembered days, months, even decades after the learning took place.  One of the most compelling theories outlines brain cell changes, which would include the change in shape and structure of brain cells, that would underlie learning and memory.  This theory has some convincing evidence that brain cells (neurons) will grow and change their shape in animals that are taught new skills.  The relationships between learning, brain cell change and the underlying mechanisms that take place within the cells themselves, however, are not well understood. This proposal is concerned with studying real learning, memory and the way that the brain changes in response to experience.  We expect to study many characteristics of the mammalian brain that may change with learning by defining 1) which neurons change, 2) alterations in protein levels, 3) the use of vascular support associated with learning. We now accept that the brain changes over the lifespan, but we do not yet know the limitations or the extent of these changes and we will 1) investigate the persistence of change over the long term and 2) determine levels of plasticity with aging. Finally, we will exam some of the factors that limit the ability of the brain to change, such as illness and injury.  The role of neurons in the cortex of the brain is the principal focus of the proposal because 1) the cortex is the most likely the storage site for long-term memories, 2) neuronal architecture has been well characterized, 3) neuronal plasticity has been reported in many motor cortex areas in response to environmental novelty and learning, and 4) motor learning-induced neuronal plasticity has been reported to correlate with physiological measures.  The significance of this work is that my lab will contribute to the understanding of how it is that we learn and remember.

"Random processes indexed by a multidimensional time parameter, or more generally, by a class of sets, may be used to model many stochastic phenomena and have been the focus of much research activity in recent years. However, the passage from a totally ordered index set (time) to a partially ordered one (multidimensional time or sets) introduces many challenges. In particular, describing the dynamical properties of the process (i.e. how the process evolves)becomes far more complicated. Elegant tools such as martingale and Markov process theory need to be extended to this more general framework.



In this research, we will be considering the analysis of set-indexed processes that are only partially observable; that is, the process may be obscured on some (random) set. In this case, we say that the process is filtered by the set. We will investigate survival analysis of filtered data and as well precedence-type tests. We will also consider the converse situation, in which the set-indexed process can be totally observed, but its behaviour changes on a random set that cannot be observed. In this case, we want to find an optimum manner of detecting the set.



All of these techniques will lead to new methods of analyzing geographic and biomedical data sets in which each data point is multidimensional.","Mathematical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Mathematics and Statistics","Ivanoff, Gail","RGPIN ","Stochastic processes","Statistics and probability","Statistique et probabilit�",3-6

"Electronics in the form of complex, highly integrated circuits and systems have now penetrated every aspects of our day to day lives.  We have seen more than five decades of constant growth and increasing complexity and performance. We are now rapidly entering the so-called late- and post-silicon era. Nanoscale types of devices are rapidly emerging, and a vast array of integrated microsystems geared for all kinds of applications, from personalized internal drug delivery to the monitoring of the environment, are being developed and deployed. The quality and reliability of such systems is very important and, in many cases, may be life-critical. This research focuses on the problem of making sure that these extremely complex systems can be tested efficiently such that only the devices and systems that meet all the intended  design and fabrication specifications are actually shipped to customers. Overall, this is a very challenging problem, because of  the very large number of possible failure mechanisms and the overall complexity of the microsystems. The work will yield robust methods to ensure the testability of systems, and thereby, their quality as well.  In addition to test, this research addresses issues of reliability. It is not only important that the systems be tested for outgoing quality, but many systems also need to perform reliably for many years, while deployed in the field. How such emerging microsystems ought to be designed and fabricated to ensure a reliable performance is a focus of this research as well.  This research will benefit Canadians in two ways. Highly qualified and versatile engineers will be trained.  The research will also yield important new test methodologies useful for other researchers in this field of integrated nano-/microsystems well as useful for current and future practitioners focused on making high quality and reliable novel microsystems rapidly available to the public at large.

"We propose to develop theoretical approaches that use experimental observables to reconstruct correlated multielectron dynamics in atoms and molecules at the attosecond (1 asec=10-18 sec) time-scale. These approaches should allow one to achieve temporal resolution far exceeding the duration of light pulses used to

trigger and interrogate these dynamics. They will lay theoretical foundation for a new type of time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of correlated multi-electron dynamics, with temporal resolution approaching 10 asec already for current experimental capabilities. In the proposed research we will push the limits of temporal resolution by (i) exploiting unique properties of state-of-the art light sources with attosecond control over optical oscillations and (ii) employing characterization techniques developed for optical signals but applied to

photo-electrons. The novel approaches will allow one to measure both amplitude and phase of photo-electron spectra, characterizing wavefunctions rather than probability distributions in multi-electron systems undergoing ionization. We will consider approaches to time-resolving both field-free and non-perturbative multielectron dynamics in atoms and molecules interacting with intense laser fields, where the strength of the light field rivals that of Coulomb fields in valence atomic shells. Specifically we will develop methods to time-resolve the following ultrafast atomic and molecular processes: (i) sub-cycle excitation dynamics during correlated double ionization of atoms in strong infrared laser fields, and (ii) sub-cycle non-adiabatic multielectron dynamics during ionization of molecules in strong infrared laser fields.

"Interacting stars are both abundant, and an essential ingredient in many dynamic astrophysical systems. Many of stars are in binaries or systems of a higher multiplicity. These systems are then sites where stellar interactions may occur -- mass transfer, ejection of the common envelope, a merger of the two stars, irradiation by X-ray luminosity or excitation of tidal pulsations. Every type of interaction drastically alters the evolutionary path of the star. A better understanding of interaction's physics is a mandatory for studies of black holes and neutron stars formation and further evolution, nature of gamma-ray bursts, gravitational mergers, stellar populations in close and distance galaxies, formation of exotic objects in globular clusters and more. 

  The difficulty is that we need to understand physics of each interaction in details, but, to verify the theory, we must compare the population of modelled systems with as complete as possible set of observations. This program proposes to make a qualitatively new progress in both understating of the details and the population studies. For instance, the current generation of population synthesis methods is intrinsically incapable of resolving the interacting stars. We propose the development of a new generation that will incorporate a self-consistent treatment of multiples as well as alive binary stellar evolution. The immediate question that will be attempted to resolve is the effect of the multiplicity on X-ray binaries population, in dense stellar systems and elliptical galaxies. Another problem is how the evolution of stars in multiples affects the integrated stellar population. This is important for cosmology, where the mass of a galaxy's stellar population is determined by its light in the observed wavelength, but it was recently shown that masses obtained by using galaxy's luminosities at different wavelengths do not match. The most important long-standing problem in details of stellar interactions is the determination of the transfer efficiency of the orbital energy to the ejection energy of the envelope. A satisfactory solution is imperative for understanding of the formation of close binaries with compact companions and can be achieved by a synthesis of a stellar evolution with hydrodynamics.

"Fish stocks have been vastly depleted worldwide, with many species driven to commercial extinction. It is estimated that the world has seen a 90 percent drop in the population of large oceanic fish since the 1950s. Led by Dalhousie University, an international research and technology development consortium, the global Ocean Tracking Network (OTN Global), aims to revolutionize the way oceans are observed and understood, and thereby contribute to more sustainable use of the oceans. The Canadian Ocean Tracking Network (OTN Canada) is the initiation of a 7-year integrative research program, in partnership primarily with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, but also with other supporting and partnering academic, government, conservation, and private organizations across Canada, which will use OTN Global technologies and infrastructure (acoustic

and satellite-linked tags, fixed and mobile acoustic receivers) to better understand continental shelf and open ocean ecosystems through cutting-edge research, to understand the nature of changes in marine ecosystems across Canada, and contribute to global observation of coastal and oceanic ecosystems. A primary objective is to foster synergy among Canadian participants, as well as potential international partners. OTN Canada will use new and innovative technologies in the Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific Ocean ""Arenas"" to address important questions and test hypotheses concerning ocean physics and modeling, animal movement and ecology, and the impacts of climate variability and change on ocean ecosystems. Not only will OTN Canada be the research hul of OTN Global, it will serve as a testing ground for international OTN partners in areas of technology development, data handling, modeling, development of analytical tools, training of highly qualified personnel,

and partnership models with industry, governments, and communities. The overarching goals of OTN Canada will be the integration of research strategies, programs, and results across Arenas with the fundamental aim of addressing critical issues in fisheries and resource management and implications for ocean governance.",Environment,Environment,Biology,"Iverson, Sara","NETGP ","Animal biology","Animal biology","Biologie animale",1-7

"Micro-electro-mechanical systems or MEMS typically involve the integration of mechanical elements, sensors, actuators and electronics on a common silicon substrate, such as a wafer, through the utilization of micro-fabrication techniques. MEMS are envisaged to revolutionize nearly every micro-device product category by bringing together silicon-based microelectronics with micromachining technologies. In this way, MEMS make possible the realization of the concept of complete ystems-on-a-chip. As a result, the commercial potential of MEMS devices is practically boundless in the current marketplace. Packaging of MEMS devices is a crucial processing step. MEMS devices are delicate structures, so that in addition to providing electrical interconnection, the package often needs to provide mechanical and environmental protection. Many MEMS packages are device specific, which can be costly, accounting for up to 90% of the system costs. One way of reducing costs is through the use of wafer-level packaging. In this method, the MEMS devices, which are fabricated on a wafer, are bonded directly to a capping wafer prior to sectioning of the wafer into individual devices. Wafer-level MEMS packaging can provide hermetic protection or provide controlled media access. Micralyne is a leading Canadian MEMS foundry, and needs to reduce production costs as a way to remain competitive, both nationally and globally, and to increase their market share.","Materials sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Chemical and Materials Engineering","Ivey, Douglas","STPGP ","Materials structure, properties and testing","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",2-3

"Being exposed to a stressor can cause the organism to become more resistant to subsequent stressors. This appears to be a basic feature of life as it has been observed at all levels of biological organization, from cells to whole organisms. This has been called by several terms including hardening, cross-tolerance, pre-adaptation, and hormesis. The increase in cellular heat shock proteins is also extraordinarily widespread. Heat shock proteins are found in plant and animal cells and increase in quantity when the cell or organism is stressed by biological as well as non-biological stressors.

   Through our NSERC-funded research, we have shown hormesis to occur in fish, particularly in the tidepool sculpins that live in the intertidal zone on the west coast of Canada. In a wide range of fish species including salmon and trout from temperate climates, various species from the tropics, and one species in Antarctica, we have been studying the role that heat shock proteins play in how fish adapt to their changing environments. We have been investigating the possible role that heat shock proteins might play in the hormetic response in fish.

   In this proposed work, we will work with the zebrafish and continue our study of the role that heat shock proteins may play in the hormetic response. We will also develop lines of zebrafish, through selective breeding, that are stress-resistant and stress-sensitive.

   We will continue our association with the fish farming industry, as well as work with the sport fishing industry, to help manage stress in fish. It is possible that stress-mitigating procedures might be developed as an outcome of our work. For example, if we can develop a way to mildly stress salmon before they are shipped, graded or otherwise handled and stressed, it may help them better cope with such stressful practices.

"Most animals exhibit some kind of behavioural display in order to attract mates. Birds, in particular, exhibit a wide range of behaviours ranging from the tail fanning display of peacocks to birdsong. This array of behaviours has attracted the attention of scientists for centuries and has resulted in a wealth of information regarding their evolution. The displays themselves are under the control of both sex hormones and the central nervous system, which interact to produce sex and species specific display behaviours. Despite the wide array of display behaviours in birds, most of the research on the endocrine and nervous control of displays has focused almost entirely on vocalizations and little is known about other displays. Recently, a group of researchers has discovered that a small Neotropical bird, the Golden-collared Manakin, possesses an array of endocrine, nervous and muscle adaptations that enable them to engage in extremely rapid wing movements. Whether the manakin is unique in this regard is, however, unknown. The North American Ruffed Grouse also possesses a rapid wing-beating display known as drumming and may have evolved similar neural and endocrine adaptations. Although a great deal is known about the basic ecology of the Ruffed Grouse, nothing is known about the neural or endocrine control of drumming. Therefore, I propose to investigate the neural and endocrine control of drumming in the Ruffed Grouse with two main aims: what brain regions and what hormones control drumming. The brains and hormone levels of Ruffed Grouse will be examined throughout the year to examine both sex and seasonal variations. In addition, comparative studies of other grouse species will reveal whether there are species specific adaptations in the neural and endocrine control of display behaviours and whether brain region size and hormone levels vary with mating system and/or display behaviour. The results of this study will yield valuable insight into how the sexual displays of birds are controlled by the hormones and the brain and how the endocrine and nervous systems have evolved in concert with one another.

The quantitative real-time PCR system measures amplifications of DNA and cDNA as it occurs cycle by cycle allowing for precise and accurate quantitative measurements during the exponential phase of PCR. The proposed instrument supports any real-time PCR application including SNP genotyping, gene expression profiling and gene detection. The proposed Mx30005 quantitative (q)PCR has the ability to detect and quantify multiple genes (maximum 5) simultaneously and validate the up-regulation of differentially expressed genes obtained from microarray analyses. Its registered software supports several analysis methods ranging from absolute to relative quantification, melting curve analysis and construction of standards. It automatically calculates relative quantities of gene expression, and create custom data reports that are easily interfaced with Microsoft, Excel and Powerpoint. It is user-friendly and the automation of this system allows researchers to maximize speed and convenience.

"The fungus Stachybotrys elegans parasitizes the plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of Rhizoctonia disease of potato. Its success as a mycoparasite is due in large part to its possession of a suite of enzymes that degrade the cell walls of R. solani.  These enzymes are used as anti-fungal compounds, and their effectiveness is enhanced when they are used in combination. The aim of this proposal is to contribute to the wider picture of mycoparasitism by providing a panoramic view of many biological processes occurring during microbe-microbe interaction. This will be accomplished by: (i) generating subtracted EST libraries comprising anonymous cDNA clones; (ii) identifying differentially expressed genes in both the mycoparasite and the host during their interaction using microarray analysis; (iii) cloning genes that are the most up-regulated genes and (iv) studying the differential and temporal expression of these genes during confrontation of S. elegans with hyphae and sclerotia of R. solani using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription (QRT)-PCR. 



The results of this research program will provide insight into the transcriptomes that drive the mycoparasitic process of S. elegans, as well as the defense mechanisms that R. solani uses to counteract infection. The collection of biocontrol-associated and defense-associated EST sequences, and their annotation, will provide important information for use in fundamental and applied research on biocontrol. The results of this program should have wide applications in plant pathology and biotechnology because the genes encoding the proteins under study can be used in the production of transgenic microorganisms with biocontrol capabilities and of transgenic plants with high resistance to plant pathogenic fungi.

"The field of space physics is relatively new, starting only a century ago with the discovery of  a relationship between the visible aurora (Northern Lights) and perturbations in the geomagnetic field.  This initiated more than fifty years of increasingly sophisticated studies using ground-based observations with a variety of optical, magnetic, and radio-frequency instruments.  



A modern age of space physics began with the advent of rocket and satellite in situ measurements of plasma fields and particle populations in the solar wind and magnetosphere.  Steady-state field topologies and particle populations in many regions of geospace are now well known, as are basic features of energy transfer from the solar wind.  However, a quantitative understanding of magnetospheric response to dynamic solar wind forcing remains an elusive goal.  



Fortunately, the 3-dimensional magnetospheric cavity is threaded by terrestrial magnetic field lines.  These produce a 2-dimensional projection of large-scale geospace dynamics onto the ionosphere, resulting in phenomena such as convection electric fields, magnetic perturbations from currents, and the visible aurora.  Appropriately located terrestrial observatories can thus provide information about important regions of geospace at a range of temporal and spatial scales.   Information provided by terrestrial sensor networks will help to answer many outstanding space physics questions and will lead to new discoveries about the complex sun-earth system.

"Ecological communities have been argued to represent either random subsets of the regional species pool, or a specific subset due to a variety of interacting effects ranging from biotic interactions (e.g. competition, predation), abiotic factors (a species intolerance to particular environmental conditions), and historical factors (e.g. colonization, evolutionary relatedness).  I propose to examine fish communities in order to further our understanding of the role of these various factors.  Lake and stream fish communities from within Ontario and at a continental scale will be tested to determine the relative importance of the biotic similarities due to their evolutionary similarities. I will determine the role of the abiotic environment in filtering out particular combinations of species due their differences or similarities in their habitat requirements, relative to the role of species interactions (e.g. competition) as determined through examining the composition of communities based on their morphology, their functional relationships (similarity in feeding, reproduction, behaviour), and their phylogenetic relationships.  As evolutionary history likely results in more closely related species sharing morphological, functional, and environmental traits, than more distantly related species, the inclusion of phylogenetic relatedness will allow a more informative test of whether communities do represent random subsets of species or whether biotic or abiotic factors appear to have a greater regulatory role in determining their composition.  

    )	We have begun work documenting major declines in crayfish communities across central Ontario and corresponding changes in water chemistry conditions, e.g. reduced calcium levels.  We will begin testing specific hypotheses to determine causal agents of this decline.

"BACKGROUND: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is an important controller of vascular function and health. This control system exerts its effects by releasing chemicals from nerves called norepinephrine (NE) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). A major site of action for the NE and NPY is on small arteries called arterioles or microvessels. At the same time as NE and NPY constrict microvessels, the endothelium (cells on the inside of vessels) competes to dilate (relax) them. Remarkably, as of yet, few experimental models have been developed to directly examine the effects of NE and NPY in live animals at the microvascular level. In fact, no one has studied the SNS and endothelial systems acting together from feed vessel to capillary bed at one time. OBJECTIVES: We shall develop a new rat skeletal muscle preparation to characterize the impact of NE and NPY, on all levels of the arteriolar tree, in real-time. Furthermore, we will investigate how the endothelium interacts with NE and NPY, on their own and together. Data generated from this research will provide new and valuable information pertaining to the impact of the SNS and the endothelium on arteriolar control and red blood cell distribution in arterioles and capillaries. APPROACH: We shall directly observe the microvasculature using a microscope, under resting conditions, and with drugs that constrict and relax vessels. From the microscope we will take videos of the blood vessels and red blood cells at all levels, and using specially designed software we will: 1) characterize the impact of NE and NPY on microvascular blood flow, from feed arteries to capillaries; 2) differentiate the influence of NE and NPY on red blood cell distribution; and 3) describe how the endothelium can impact NE and NPYs functional role. SIGNIFICANCE: The data generated from this model will provide first hand information pertaining to the complete and combined role of the endothelium, NE, and NPY on the microvasculature. Besides gaining new and direct insight into the control of skeletal muscle blood flow and hemodynamics, this experimental data will confirm and build on our current departmental efforts in mathematical modeling of skeletal muscle tissue blood flow and oxygen transport.

"Lakes provide ecosystem services to people in the form of clean water for drinking, irrigation, fishing, recreation, watering livestock, hydroelectric generation and transportation.  These services are impaired by the degradation of lakes and their surrounding watersheds.  Human activities affect lakes and the sustainability of the services they provide.  When key components of lakes and their watersheds (rooted aquatic plants, game fish, riparian vegetation) are in place and functioning, lake-watershed ecosystems can maintain normal functioning.  The general goal of my research program is to understand the processes that control the state in which shallow lakes are found, and the services that they provide.



There are 3 components to my research program.  The first focuses on developing the mechanistic theory to understand the processes in lakes that allow them to resist change and remain in a desirable state.  The second component involves using models to consider scenarios of change within lakes.  This component synthesizes concepts related to the stability of shallow lakes, and considers how changs to key processes and their drivers might affect the state in which a lake is found.  The third component involves field experimentation to directly test hypotheses related to theory development and model predictions.  Each component is a complimentary approach to analyzing ecosystems and is designed to develop a general understanding of the existance of regime shifts in shallow lakes.

"My research program is concerned with understanding the nature of wind flow in areas of complex terrain: over mountains, through valleys, and along mountainous coastlines. The proposed research involves both making measurements (directly at the surface, and remotely above the surface), and mainly involves conducting high-resolution computer simulations of the atmosphere in these areas. In conducting this research theme, a number of projects will be undertaken to address both basic and applied atmospheric science questions, as well as collaborative projects with multidisciplinary questions. In addition to furthering basic understanding of the atmospheric boundary layer, this work will address important questions with health, safety, and economic implications such as: transport and dispersion of air pollution and forest pests; forecasting winds for marine, aviation and public users; assessing areas in forests prone to strong winds with a view to managing forests to minimize timber blow down. The new CFI/BCKDF-funded High Performance Computing Facility at UNBC will be used to conduct continuous high-resolution (horizontal grid spacing of 1 to 3  km) simulations of the atmosphere over several areas of particular interest in the British Columbia central interior and coastal zone. Model output will be validated through comparisons with observations. Model output at high resolution will be archived for a multi-year period, allowing phenomenological research to go beyond analysis of only a few case studies, and to develop reasonable statistics based upon the high resolution model output. Some results of this research are anticipated to lead to: improved methods of forecasting air quality and winds; better understanding of the long-range transport of mountain pine beetle infestations; information for forest resource managers to use in better planning forest harvesting and treatments to minimize economic loss and ecological damage from tree blow down; and a better understanding of the effects of future climate on glacier mass balance in the western cordillera.",Environment,Environment,"Environmental Engineering","Jackson, Peter","RGPIN ","Boundary layer","Atmospheric science","�tude de l'atmosph�re",3-5
"A growing number of behavioural, cognitive and brain imaging studies show that individuals come to understand the intentions and mental states of other people with the help of the neural systems that produces the same states in themselves. Evidence for this correspondence has initially been discovered in monkeys in which a specific type of brain cells call ""mirror neurons"" were found to respond both to a specific action and to the observation of the same action performed by another individual. Mirror neurons are thought to represent the long sought missing biological link between perception and action, and has been suggested to be responsible for even more complex social interactions such as human empathy. We argue, based on evidence from multiple disciplines, that empathy can be divided into different components and that many brain systems (including but not exclusively mirror neurons) are involved in this process. This research program proposes to investigate the many facets of human empathy by using different methodological means, including behavioural testing, measures of physiological response, and brain imaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. The main objective is to develop reliable measures for the different components of human empathy and refine the proposed multidisciplinary model of this complex yet fascinating emotional ability. A better understanding of the behavioural and cerebral bases of empathy will provide a strong framework for future research in the innovative domain of social cognitive neuroscience and could lead to future work on creative topics such as the cerebral roots of moral and altruistic behaviour.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge","Sciences sociales, Facult� des","Jackson, Philip","RGPIN ","Cognitive science -- other",Psychology,Psychologie,3-5

"This project aims to identify problems and challenges with the current integration middleware systems running

large enterprise applications at Bell. These insights serve as motivation for evaluating and improving the

PADRES \textit{Enterprise Service Bus} (ESB) system and concepts developed by the Middleware Systems

Research Group (MSRG).

The PADRES ESB is a content-based message routing substrate. Services and applications interact with the

bus by publishing and subscribing events to the bus. Subscribing and publishing is based on event and

message content, not on IP-address information. The content-based publish/subscribe style of interaction is a

very simple but extremely powerful abstraction. The PADRES ESB is a fully implemented Java-based

research prototype. This project aims to prove the effectiveness of this abstraction to serve as the integration

fabric for large enterprise applications.

The scientific research objectives are to model the problems and challenges identified in the Bell enterprise

application infrastructure with the PADRES ESB and to determine if and where PADRES falls short of

addressing them. The second phase of this research will then develop techniques to overcome problems and

challenges and to quantify through implementation and experimentation how these problems have been

addressed.

The outcome of this research has the potential to influence middleware abstractions, middleware standards, and

the direction enterprise application development will take in the years to come.","Computer software","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering, Edward S.

"Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks exploit the tremendous bandwidth of an optical fiber by supporting multiple channels at different wavelengths on a single fiber. A lightpath in an optical network is an end to end communication path, which can traverse multiple fibers and is allocated one WDM channel on each fiber it uses. It is important to use the capacity of the available WDM channels fairly and efficiently, to provide a guaranteed quality of service for high priority demands and also accommodate regular traffic. The proposed research will apply recent operations research (OR) techniques to address a number of important open problems in the area of optical networking. These include:



i)    )	Developing survivable traffic grooming techniques that combine individual low-speed traffic requests into a single lightpath and also provide a means to route around faults (e.g. fiber cuts) in the original paths.



ii)    )	Investigating the practical feasibility of waveband switching to reduce the number of ports in optical switches and 



iii)    )	Investigating the use of regular graphs as candidates for logical topologies.

"We are all prone to the risks embedded in the financial markets. On a world scale, these risks are becoming both more diversified and simultaneously more interlinked. One of the main reasons that the financial markets exist is so that individuals who do not wish to take on certain risk characteristics can trade them away in exchange for a risk profile they are comfortable with. Individual investors do this mostly by trading in stocks and bonds, or managed portfolios through mutual funds. However, the main forces which push the financial markets are welded by the sophisticated investment bankers. They produce ever more complex financial instruments to sate the appetite of risk seekers, hedgers and arbitragers - investors who speculate on risk, investors who wish to remove or balance risk, and investors who try to make (almost) for sure profits by offsetting one risk against another. 

          These complex financial instruments tend to derive their value, hence the name derivatives, and their payoffs from some other more fundamental source, for example from stock prices, commodity prices, mortgages, mortality (through insurance-linked products) and even other derivatives. This study focuses on building stochastic models, and numerical implementations which will lead to more accurate analysis of the embedded risks in these products. In particular, I will be developing models suitable for energy related commodities such as crude oil and electricity by using singular perturbation methods (which provide approximate but explicit answers). As well, I will develop so called hidden Markov models, in which the mathematical description of the world states switch according to an underlying hidden process. The ultimate goal is to provide analytical formulas, robust algorithms and efficient calibration procedures for a wide class of markets including commodities, equities, credit and insurance.

"Forming of engineering components made from conventional wrought alloys via sheet and bulk metal forming has been employed for many decades. Many of these processes are now being simulated using the finite element method in an effort to optimize them. Although the finite element modeling is rapidly displacing experimental effort in understanding the material and process behaviour, the models are often poorly developed and validated. It is critical that the modeling methodology and tools are accurate (and not just robust and efficient) in their prediction of material and process characteristics. 



The proposed research will develop new and advanced formability testing and strain measurement techniques, constitutive material modeling and process modeling capabilities in terms of speed, accuracy and a wider range of test conditions (for example low and high temperature, slow and rapid strain rates etc.)for new automotive applications. The emphasis will be on critical and novel approaches towards formability testing for new and emerging materials and forming processes in automotive industry. Also, qualitatively different experimental data at different spatial scales will be utilized in the critical assessment of the finite element simulations of formability tests and forming processes. The results of this research will lead to more rigorous evaluation of the FE technology for use in the metal forming related industries to optimize material properties and forming processes and thus to reduce costs and improve product quality.

"Our bioorganic chemistry program has the broad goals of furthering an understanding of the physiological roles played by carbohydrate-manipulating enzymes and using these catalysts to perform novel chemistry. The proposed research will use: synthetic chemistry to access novel substrates; mutagenesis and kinetic analyses to probe and evolve catalyst function; and NMR spectroscopy to provide structural insight into protein-ligand interactions.

Having obtained preliminary data on several model enzyme systems in our previous NSERC funding period, we will focus upon developing screening and selection methodologies for two families of enzymes with an intent to identify novel chemical reactivity. Two projects are described more fully whilst two are described in lesser detail due to space limitations.

1. We will develop a new selection strategy for evolving glycosynthases (EryBI D273G) that form beta-(1,2)- glycosidic linkages. The unique feature of this project is the recognition that improved glycosynthases will inactivate macrolide antibiotics through glycosylation and ensure growth of their host cell. This will enable us to select for different donor and acceptor specificities.

2. We will characterize in vitro a 2,6-dideoxyglycosyltransferase with a demonstrated broad substrate specificity and manipulate the glycosylation mechanism using directed evolution to convert the enzyme from an O-glycosyltransferase into a C-glycosyltransferase.

3. We will engineer substrate for nucleotidylyltransferases in order to provide access to bifunctional glycosyltransferase probes with bioorthogonal reactivity as cellular tags or as glycosyltransferase inhibitors.

4. We will chemoenzymatically synthesize analogues of UDP-GlcNAc, as potential mechanism-based inhibitors of cell wall biosynthetic enzymes, exploiting our observations in the substrate specificity of nucleotidylyltransferases.

"Muscle activity has traditionally been measured in laboratory studies, and results have subsequently been extrapolated to provide an indication of functional decline during daily life. However, recent work in my laboratory is the first to use portable electromyography (EMG) to measure muscle activity during daily life. These recordings over a typical 8-hour day in upper and lower limb muscles indicate that low threshold EMG increases in women compared with men, and that this difference becomes greater with age. Low-threshold EMG is quantified through assessing bursts of muscle activity (>2% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), >0.1s duration) and gaps in activity (<1% of maximal >0.1s duration). The underlying cause of sex- and age-related increases in low threshold EMG remains to be determined. Surface EMG recordings detect only activity from muscle fibres of motor units (MU) active within the recording area of the electrode. Thus, the IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE of my research is to determine whether changes in MU recruitment and discharge rates contribute to the age- and sex-related increase in low threshold EMG. My WORKING HYPOTHESIS is that as a consequence of changes in muscle length during movement sensory feedback to the motor neuron pool is altered and MU recruitment and discharge rates are modulated and this influences the low-threshold EMG recordings. Shorter muscle fascicle length and greater tendon compliance in old adults and women will influence the position dependent effect. These studies will contribute to understanding the basic physiological role of sensory feedback in modulating MU activity and elucidate the cause of age- and sex-related increases in low threshold EMG activity.

"I work on questions in spectral theory that have their origins in mathematical physics (spectra and eigenfunctions of Laplace-type and Dirac-type operators). I often study questions in the high-energy regime such as spectral statistics, as well as asymptotic properties of of high energy eigenstates: uniform distribution, $L^p$ norms, nodal and critical sets, semiclassical asymptotics. These questions lie at the intersection of analysis, partial differential equations, differential geometry, dynamical systems and mathematical physics. One of my main interests is the area of quantum chaos. The subject originated with the use of random matrix theory to model the spectra of atomic nuclei. Later it was recognized that similar phenomena occur in many other areas of mathematics and physics. I propose to continue my study of relationship between ergodic theory of partially hyperbolic dynamical systems, and high energy behavior of eigenfunctions of matrix-valued operators, such as Hodge Laplacian and Dirac operators. I also intend to study high energy spectra and eigenfunctions for systems where wave propagation involves branching (or ray-splitting); such systems arise, for example, in elasticity and acoustics. Many natural questions in semiclassical analysis of such systems remain unexplored, and require establishing new results in ergodic theory.

I also intend to study steady solutions to Euler and Navier-Stokes equations using spectral methods. In dimension 3, eigenfields of curl operator give rise to such solutions, and are dual to co-closed eigenforms of the Hodge Laplacian. The corresponding flows are called Beltrami or force-free flows; they also arise in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, e.g. in the study of dynamo theory in astrophysics. In dimension 2, steady flows correspond to eigenfunctions of (possibly nonlinear) elliptic operators; I intend to study this correspondence further.

"The phenomena of the world are irreversible: we remember past and not future, a broken window does not suddenly reassemble itself, and heat flows from hot to cold. Since the early days of statistical mechanics the macroscopic distinction between past and future has caused wonder. How does irreversible thermodynamics emerge from time reversible microscopic equations of classical and quantum mechanics?  How can one explain the constant increase of entropy (disorder) around us on the basis of mechanics? The fundamental works of Boltzmann, Gibbs, Maxwell, Einstein and many others have explained the observable phenomenon, but the underlying questions have provoked much discussion and controversy, even today. 



From the mathematical side, the vision and insights of the early pioneers are very difficult to justify rigorously. Enquiry along these lines has led to some exceedingly difficult problems in mathematics. A mathematically rigorous justification of the fundamental works in statistical mechanics is one of the major open problems in mathematical physics. 



This research proposal deals with mathematical development of non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics, both near equilibrium (which from physical point of view was understood by the early pioneers) and far from equilibrium (this includes chemical reactions and biology, and is a wide open research area in theoretical and experimental physics).  The basic notions of non-equilibrium steady states, entropy production, heat fluxes, conductivity, fluctuations are defined and their  properties are studied. The basic laws of thermodynamics are proven from the first principles. This study involves some of the most advanced tools from modern mathematics.

"Exposure to heavy metal ions has profound health effects. Only a few are positive, such as the therapeutic effects of some platinum, bismuth and gold compounds, but accumulation of heavy metals in the environment is causing severe problems. Uptake via food, drinking water and the atmosphere of e.g., lead (dust from previous lead-based paint and leaded gasoline), cadmium (smoking and food) and mercury (in fish), can affect the human metabolism by replacing zinc and calcium in enzymes. Most heavy metal ions show high affinity to thiol (-SH) groups, which, in physiological systems, mostly occur in cysteine residues e.g., in enzymes, hormones or cell receptors. The tripeptide glutathione (Glutamyl-Cysteine-Glycine), the most abundant cellular thiol in the body, is important for protection against heavy metal ions. Its metal complexes form part of enzymes with dominant roles in protein metabolism. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a natural antioxidant, has long been used in several treatments, from heart diseases to HIV-1 retardation. NAC improves the efficiency of clinical chelating agents and facilitates detoxification of Cr, Cd and Pb. Recent bio-tests on NAC complexes with transition biometals (Zn, Co, Fe) showed significant anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, the nature of the coordination of metal ions to N-acetyl cysteine and glutathione is needed for better understanding of such reaction mechanisms and also for improving specific cysteine based clinical detoxification agents. We will prepare such complexes with NAC and glutathione in solution and in the solid state, and use synchrotron-based X-ray absorption, vibrational, and NMR spectroscopic methods to study the local structure around the metal atoms for systems where crystallography cannot be applied. By establishing the bonding environment around the metal ions in these complexes as models for in-vivo conditions, and correlating their structures to their clinical properties, more efficient chelating agents for detoxification can be designed. Training of highly qualified researchers in applying synchrotron radiation methods is part of this project, and is required for efficient use of the advanced Canadian Light Source facility, the largest scientific project in Canada.

"Nos recherches s'articulent autour de la mod�lisation, la simulation et l'optimisation de politiques de prise de d�cision. L'objectif principal �tant la mise au point de syst�me intelligent, bas� sur une approche multi-mod�le, ou la prise de d�cision se fait en temps r�el.

Nos travaux, qui repr�sentent une suite logique et naturelle de nos recherches doctorales et postdoctorales, se situent dans un cadre de d�veloppement durable caract�ris� par la r�duction du gaspillage, par l'optimisation de l'utilisation des ressources et par la mod�lisation de l'incertitude et du risque. 

D'une part, nous mettons l'accent sur le d�veloppement d'une m�thodologie de planification des activit�s de maintenance et de valorisation. L'id�e serait d'�valuer les co�ts et les b�n�fices engendr�s par diff�rents sc�narios de maintenance et de valorisation, et ce, afin d'opter pour le sc�nario le plus appropri�.

D'autre part, nous nous focalisons sur le d�veloppement d'un cadre th�orique pour la planification int�gr�e de la maintenance et de la production dans le cas d'un  flowshop hybride ou chaque machine ayant sa propre distribution d'occurrence de panne.

"Complex fluids are liquids containing suspended particles or dissolved polymer chains, which generally cause flow behaviour to be frustratingly different than that of simple fluids like water and gasoline.  Some common complex fluids are shampoo, ketchup and blood, and some industrially important ones are paints and agricultural sprays. The general objective with these viscoelastic fluids is to understand the underlying physics, to characterize the flow resistance, and to develop the descriptive equations.  My specific objective is to characterize the flow resistance to stretching or elongational motion, for shearing resistance has already been well established.  In recent work toward the objective, we developed a technique to measure the stretching resistance of barely elastic liquids such as inkjet inks. The novel technique was patented and has been proven useful for the liquid whitener applied on bond paper, enabling improved efficiency in papermaking.  We now want to apply this technique to other barely elastic liquids such as paints, with the goal of enabling new 'improved' formulations to be evaluated in the laboratory instead of trying them on the production line.

    Another project with a complex fluid pertains to polymer drag reduction, where a minute amount of a dissolved long-chain polymer reduces pipeline friction by up to 70%, as in the TransAlaska pipeline. Ascertaining the effectiveness of a polymer from laboratory tests has so far not been possible, creating a longstanding obstacle to wider applications. Having understood the role of the polymer, my objective is to develop a bench-scale device for laboratory testing, to minimize costly full-scale tests.

   Physiological lubrication, the process by which a healthy joint does not wear under load, has long been a mystery.  Motivated by the mystery and inadequate prior theories, a student and I developed a new explanation, and now the objective is to measure the fluid film thickness in a functioning joint, to verify our hypothesis and eventually to aid physicians in treating diseased joints.

"Research Summary



    )	Limestones, made of marine fossils, are archives of evolution in the marine biosphere, our best record of past oceans and development of the ocean-atmosphere system, amongst the nation's most prolific hydrocarbon reservoirs, and aquifers for fresh waters.  Research is focused on the least understood but widespread type of limestone, those that formed in cool to very cold ocean waters.  Studies are located in the modern ocean and the rock record and include the Southern Ocean (the largest modern area of these deposits), relatively young rocks of similar composition exposed onshore, limestones in the Canadian Arctic that formed during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA-350-245 Ma), and carbonates that were deposited during the most profound glaciation the world has ever known (Neoproterozoic ~800 Ma) and exposed in the Mackenzie Mountains, NWT and Australia. 

    )	Funds are requested for the: 1) acquisition and analysis of marine samples from the Australian continental shelf and slope, 2) detailed study of relatively unknown modern cold-water neritic environments wherein kelp control production of carbonate sediment, 3) documentation of the relationship between nutrients and coral reef growth at the tropical-temperate interface, 4) utilization of bryozoan proxies to determine specific cool-water paleoceanographic environments, 5) establishment of sedimentological and paleontological criteria to define boundaries between depositional realms, 6) use of the LPIA to understand how the globe came out of a glacial period like the one we are in today, 7) determination, via the nature of carbonate sedimentation, how the ocean evolved during the Neoproterozoic global glaciation just before the evolution of animals and finally, 8) experimentation to determine, via direct observation under controlled conditions, how microbes affect specific aspects of carbonate sediment formation. A total of 11 students will be trained.

"This new research program addresses the human factors of sustainable domestic energy consumption. The central objective of the program is to develop and test human-computer interfaces that raise the level of competence of novice consumers in making energy use decisions in the home. High consumer competence has been shown to be a reliable predictor of sustainable energy consumption. However, consumer knowledge of home energy consumption (e.g., of what appliances or activities consume the most energy) tends to be poor. Thus, increasing competence through effective interface design can remove a barrier to more sustainable living.



The research program serves the public interest through the development of new technologies to increase the usefulness and usability of domestic energy appliances and systems. These technologies will make it easier for Canadians to contribute to a sustainable energy economy.

"Gold mines frequently have high natural arsenic concentrations in tailings and nearby streams and ground water. The optimal remediation(clean-up) plan should protect the local population from health risks associated with ingesting arsenic-rich solids or waters. In the case of publicly accessible sites in Nova Scotia, where arsenic is present at concentrations hundreds to thousands times the recommended soil guideline, placing a cover on the tailings seems like an obvious solution. However, this may trigger dissolution of the arsenic-bearing minerals and lead to a pulse of arsenic being released to local streams and groundwater. The situation is complicated because the stability of the arsenic-bearing minerals is not well-known.Conventional remediation designs such as flooding, removal or fencing are problematic because of the high solubility of the As minerals, dust hazards and expense associated with removal and community resistance regarding fencing. We propose to conduct experiments and field tests investigating the biogeochemical stability of different tailings types in order to design the best plan to protect downstream surface and groundwaters and reduce risk to human health for individuals using the area for recreatio- nal purposes. Our experiments will use new equipment to test the effect of environmental conditions and advanced analytical techniques that can determine whether arsenic is dissolved in groundwater or moves as colloidal particles. If most of the As is colloidal, the risk is assessed differently since mobility depends on mineral stability. Two large environmental consulting companies support the project by sharing their expertise and helping to train students. These companies will be exposed to the state-of-the-art knowledge in remediation research. The NS government has indicated that they will use our results to help in the ongoing developing of public policy related to the historic and new gold mine. The results of our research will provide experimentally-tested recommendations applicable to many of the thousands of abandoned mine sites in Canada.

"What is a memory?  How does a person's wealth of prior experience come to influence the decisions they make?  Can an understanding of human memory lead to the design of intelligent machines? My research program is aimed at answering these questions.  To achieve this goal my students and I develop computer models that describe the mathematics of learning and categorization.  We test the models by matching the behaviour of the models against that of people.  By representing memory as a store of specific experiences, and retrieving those memories in parallel, we have explained how people become sensitive to regularities in the world, how they will choose to sort items into categories, and how they will conceive of categories flexibly under different learning circumstances.

"Gene expression is the fundamental process of decoding DNA to RNA into protein. Decoding RNA into protein, called translation, involves a large complex macromolecular machine called the ribosome. The ribosome reads and moves along the RNA sequence to sequentially add amino acids to the nascent protein. It is apparent that translation is highly regulated and the rates and fidelity of translation can be influenced under different biological situations such as cellular stress and viral infection. Currently, the exact regulations and mechanisms affecting ribosome decoding and movement of the ribosome is poorly understood. Because of its fundamental importance, it is imperative that we understand the full repertoire of translation mechanisms and regulations. To directly address these issues, we have developed a novel minimal reconstituted translation system in order to delineate the mechanisms and factors involved. This system will allow us to systematically add back factors one at a time in order to elucidate the function of each step. Moreover, this system allows the unique opportunity to study events downstream of initiation such as the movement and decoding of RNA. Using biochemical approaches, we will characterize how the ribosome accurately decodes RNA as well as how factors are mediating the movement of the ribosome.  Finally, as RNA can fold and form stable structures, we will also test how the ribosome interacts and unwinds these RNA structures. By taking advantage of this minimal system, these experiments will enhance our knowledge of basic gene expression mechanisms.

"The proposed research is a unique and realizable extension of the applicant's previous work on vision-based control of robots. The ""long-term"" focus of this research program is on the development of high-performance control methods, using image feedback, to address robot positioning and contact problems that currently necessitate significant treatment effort in structuring the robotic cells. In addition to the design and manufacture of specialized part feeders, fixtures, and end-effectors, extensive robot teaching is required for new tasks. The resulting high engineering costs prevent robots from being versatile reprogrammable machines, adapting quickly to new tasks. The long-range view of the proposal is that the integration of image information for the control of robotic manipulation provides an enormous potential for robots to operate in unstructured and remote environments. The ""short-term"" objectives of this proposal focus on the unresolved issues for high-performance image-servoed robotic and telerobotic systems. Key features of the proposed research include: i) development of novel image-servoed control techniques, with the focus on both vision and ultrasound imaging modalities, to enable operation and teleoperation of robots in unstructured environments; ii)  extension of the results to establish unique and novel image-based techniques for flexible part feeding, telesurgery, and fixtureless micromanipulation; and iii) training of significant number of personnel in a highly multi-disciplinary area where the synergy of different engineering fields becomes increasingly important. The proposed research results could eliminate cell structuring and robot teaching efforts, and would provide the potential to relax the mechanical accuracy and stiffness requirements for robotic mechanisms, reducing their cost and extending their applications. The outcome of this research work is expected to entail unique and systematic procedures for the design of robust manipulation and telemanipulation systems. The availability of such procedures could have a significant and immediate impact by improving the execution of current tasks and by facilitating applications previously taught to be almost impossible with classical techniques.

"Optical techniques such as inelastic light scattering, photoluminescence and infrared interferometry are very useful to develop fundamental science and to explain microscopic interactions in solids. We use these techniques to better understand the mechanisms and microscopic properties of: a)-recently discovered colossal magnetoresitance in manganites R(1-x)A(x)MnO3 (R = rare earth and A=Ba, Sr, Ca) where an unusually large change of resistivity is observed  following the application of magnetic field. Such materials are on one hand interesting from a fundamental viewpoint since charge, spin and lattice ions are strongly coupled giving rise to numerous physical phenomena and phase transitions of current interest in condensed matter. On the other hand, they offer potential in magnetic recording media sensors and spin polarized electronics. b)-high critical temperature superconductors, e.g. R(2-x)Ce(x)CuO4, characterized by absence of resistance and perfect diamagnetism prevalence below Tc. They are important materials typically for current transport without losses, for high magnetic field generation and for devices that detect very weak magnetic fields. c)-rare earth based optical devices such as solid state lasers and optical memories obtained by doping oxides with rare earth ions (e.g. Nd: YVO4 and Yb:Y2SiO5). 

In the former materials, rare earth ions (Pr, Nd, Sm...) are incorporated. Light scattering and infrared spectroscopy constitute our tools to detect the ions vibrations and the energy levels of the 4f rare earth electrons. These levels are used as local probes to detect the various electrical and magnetic interactions between electron-electron, electron-ion and ion-ion. Using quantum mechanics formalism, we then model the various electrical and magnetic interactions. These interactions are tuned and modified as a function of temperature, applied magnetic field, hydrostatic pressure, and doping. In these materials, we detect phase separation in small domains where different and contrasted characteristics prevail. A basic comprehension of their properties would allow applications of these materials in high technology optics and electronics.

"The proposed research will focus on modeling and solving integrated production planning problems. In production planning problems, one has to determine the timing and level of production to satisfy a specific demand over time. These production planning models can be extended to incorporate further operational and scheduling aspects or can be integrated with other planning problems upstream or downstream in the supply chain, e.g. the routing decisions for the distribution planning. Such integrated models will lead to globally more cost efficient solutions and a better use of the scarce resources compared to the situation where two linked processes are optimized separately. For these integrated production planning methods, we want to 1) obtain a better understanding of the problem and a good model representation; 2) develop optimization techniques to solve such integrated problems, and 3) generate insights into the cost effectiveness of these integrated models by comparing them to the outcomes of a hierarchical optimization approach.

"Wine strains of S. cerevisiae have developed complex regulatory mechanisms to cope with high initial sugar concentrations, depleting nutrients, and gradually increasing ethanol concentrations in fermenting grape juice. The molecular and cellular adaptations of industrial wine yeasts to these long-term environmental stresses during grape must fermentation have not been well studied. To investigate how yeast adapts to the harsh conditions during the fermentation of grape must, genome-wide transcription was assayed at five time points during alcoholic fermentation. For each gene, the temporal trend throughout the fermentation process was summarized with two parameter values that describe the overall change and shape of the expression profile. A seeded clustering algorithm was applied in order to group the genes around the expression patterns exhibited by 20 genes whose temporal trends span the range of patterns observed across the entire transcriptome. Analyses of the yeast transcriptome throughout wine fermentations revealed that 40% of the yeast genome significantly changed expression levels to mediate long-term adaptation to fermentation stress; 223 genes were dramatically induced at various points during fermentation and were designated as Fermentation Stress Response (FSR) genes. The FSR is novel and 62% of the genes involved have not been implicated in global stress responses; 28% of the FSR genes have no functional annotation. Functional analyses of these 62 non-annotated FSR genes are in currently in progress. In addition, we found 20 non-annotated genes that were significantly down-regulated and 31 non-annotated genes that were significantly up-regulated during wine fermentations. In this grant application we will construct null mutants of all 51 non-annotated genes and use a systems biology approach, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, to establish functions of these non-annotated genes that are regulated during wine fermentations.

"A popular model of a linear polymer is a self-avoiding walk on a lattice (such as the square grid). This model is related combinatorial models of directed and partially directed paths.  Such walk and path models are able to mimic the conformational degrees of a freedom of a linear polymer; these degrees of freedom make an important contribution to the free energy of the polymer and determines some of its physical and chemical properties.  Lattice walks and paths are also related to classical model in combinatorics.



The key problem in virtually all these models is the enumeration of lattice walks and paths of a given length, and mathematicians have develop a number of techniques for both counting a variety of different path models, as well as for the numerical simulation of lattice walks with the intention of learning more about the thermodynamic phase diagram of polymers.  



In this proposal, recent progress in the combinatorics of lattice paths, and in the numerical simulation of lattice walks and paths, are reviewed with the intention of proposing new avenues for researching both the mathematical and physical properties of these models using both analytic and numerical methods.  The potential results includes a better understanding of the fundamental ideas underlying the scaling and physical properties of polymers, as well as the development of new mathematical techniques and algorithms for solving and simulating particular model of lattice paths and self-avoiding walk models of polymers.

"The last decade has seen increased interest in the structure of self-organizing networks such as the World Wide Web, social networks,  and biological networks: for example those formed by the interactions of proteins in a cell. This interest has opened up a new direction of study in graph theory, which combines elements of the theory of random graphs, structural graph theory, graph clustering, and infinite graphs. In addition, some of the techniques that need to be employed to model these real-life networks are akin to those used in the natural sciences, but are not part of traditional graph theory: exploration of the data, development and analysis of stochastic models, and validation of the models.

My current research interest lies in the analysis of those stochastic graph models that I consider the most promising. In particular, I intend to continue my study of the ""generalized copy model"". This model is based on the evolutionary principle of duplication and error. New nodes joining the graph ""copy"" each of the links of an existing node with a certain probability, and then add a pre-defined number of randomly chosen extra ""error"" links. A promising new tool to analyze this and other models is the study of the infinite limit of the model.

A second class of models that hold my interest are models that have a ""geometric"" component. This means that each node corresponds to a point in some Euclidean space, and its attachment to the rest of the graph is influenced by its geometric position with respect to other nodes. Geometric models seem to have many features that correspond to those observed in real- life self-organizing networks. In particular, I would like to study the possibility of ""reverse engineering"" a graph generated according to geometric principles: given a graph that is assumed to be generated according to a certain geometric model, is it possible to estimate the position of the corresponding points? Solving this problem would give rise to new tools to extract community structure in social networks, better Web search methods, and generally give us a better understanding of networked data.

"The toxicity of selenium (Se) in aquatic systems, particularly to fishes, is currently one of the most debated and research intensive areas of aquatic ecotoxicology in North America. Metal and coal mining activities in Canada and elsewhere have been shown to cause elevated levels of selenium in aquatic ecosystems receiving their discharges, which can impact the sustainability of fish populations and the integrity of ecosystem structure and function. It is in the interest of Canada's environmental stewardship and scientific leadership to better understand factors influencing exposure and potential toxicological effects of Se in aquatic ecosystems, thereby developing a science-based management and regulatory approach. The overall objective of this three year project is to use an integrative, multidisciplinary approach to investigate temporal and spatial dynamics of the distribution, speciation, fate and effects of Se in a northern (boreal) aquatic ecosystem receiving effluent from a metal mining operation. Using field surveys, field experiments (in situ invertebrate and fish caging studies), mesocosm experiments (multi-trophic studies with partial life-cycle fish bioassays), and laboratory experiments (invertebrate feeding and accumulation studies, studies examining the consequences of larval deformities on performance) we intend to better define the trophic transfer of Se and thresholds for response across abiotic and biotic compartments of an aquatic ecosystem. Using state-of-the science synchrotron technology, we will define the form of Se (speciation) and its transformation across media and biota with the goal of determining relationships between speciation and toxicity. Our results will: 1) further the field of Se ecotoxicology; 2) define conditions of exposure and effects associated with coldwater habitats; 3) assist industry to better understand effects that exist in an effort to move towards sustainable solutions; and 4) develop clear and defensible exposure thresholds for preventing adverse ecological impacts. A study of this level of integration and scope has not been conducted in Canada before and has national and international implications far beyond this specific study site.

"Seneca believes that the CCIP (College and Community Innovation Program) has the potential to help us scale and grow the research capacity of Seneca's Centre for Development of Open Technology (CDOT) in order to meet the ever-increasing needs of our current and prospective partners. Over the past decade, Seneca has established deep roots working with some of the largest open source companies on software that matters to hundreds of millions of users around the world. Through partnerships with large open source companies, and in particular their Toronto offices, we have established a model for real world involvement of faculty, staff, and students in large scale development projects. These large partners and potential partners are interested in having us work with them to develop highly trained individuals for employment, to collaboratively leverage open source technology, and to engage then in the network of open source collaboration that benefits the industry as a whole.



What we have begun in the context of the classroom and through smaller research grants is ready to expand. Instead of turning away local small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) for lack of time and resources, we would like to be able to share with them the best open source practices and processes, as well as the connections we have made doing open source research and development. Local SMEs will significantly benefit from what we know about how to work with open source: from leveraging existing open technology in new products, to reductions in licensing costs, to increased global collaboration.

"Canada's flight training industry is in a serious state of decline. Over the past five years, the number of Flight Training Businesses (FTBs) in Canada has decreased from 222 to 166, a failure of one in four. Seneca College's research partnerships with the flight training industry have identified the potential of increased use of flight simulation to mitigate this decline. As well, there is a as gap in applied research about simulation technology and its implementation in aviation training. The critical first component is to establish the needed capacity for applied research in the area of simulation technology.



However, Seneca's industry partners recognize that they lack the ability and resources to conduct this research independently; this reality forms the underlying motivation for this project and the industry partnerships that accompany it.



CCI funding would support building the necessary applied research capacity to justify increased simulation technology use in flight training. The immediate research objectives for the project include: developing applied research expertise and capacity; identifying how to best increase simulation use to decrease aircraft flight hours; and measuring pilots' non-technical competencies to determine how simulation can be used to replicate conventional flight experiences, currently gained in aircraft.



Seneca's School of Aviation and Flight Technology has been an industry leader in rigorous, technology-based flight education and training for commercial and transport pilots for more than 40 years with the necessary resources to fill this gap in applied research.



CCI funding would directly facilitate increased research capacity at Seneca and strengthen the College's industry relations. Through Seneca's creation of the network tools and online training programs created to fill the gap in applied research capabilities, the flight training industry will have a sustainable resource for future research initiatives and partnerships.

"The study of encryption schemes based on elliptic curves has attracted considerable interest

from the research community ever since their discovery 20 years ago by Miller and

(independently) Koblitz. Elliptic curve systems are unique among all public key systems in

that they have successfully maintained the highest known security levels for the longest

period of time among all such systems available today. My research aims to improve our

understanding of elliptic curve cryptosystems by investigating the mathematical foundations

of elliptic curve arithmetic.  My methods combine both rigorous mathematics and cryptology

in order to achieve results that are beyond the reach of either approach in isolation. In

earlier work, I show for the first time that the security of elliptic curve cryptosystems

depends in almost all cases purely on the key size of the elliptic curve, assuming the

generalized Riemann hypothesis. I intend to build upon this work and extend these results to

hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems, while at the same time exploring new constructions of

expander graphs and public key cryptosystem designs arising from the techniques that I used.

"In the past 25 years, machine learning, first, and then, data mining, made constant progress to the point where the technology is now being used in all walks of life such as in automatic fraud detection, recommender systems, equipment monitoring and so on. In recent years, however, very few actual improvements were reported in the literature, particularly in the area of classification. This could either mean that classification is at its pinnacle and does not need to be investigated any further; or it could mean that our approach to evaluating the outcome of our classification algorithms is too simplistic and does not consider all the relevant aspects of our systems. Given the reticence of many practitioner in other fields to adopt our techniques which are not, they feel, tested to a level of adequacy that makes them worth their while, the latter is more likely than the former. The purpose of this proposed research is, thus, to address the issue of classifier evaluation by proposing to build a software tool that will allow classifiers to be evaluated visually so as to allow the user to gather a great deal of relevant information on the performance of one or several systems, in a way that is both sound and humanely understandable. In particular, we propose a new framework that approaches the problem of classifier evaluation as a problem of visualization of high-dimensional data. In so doing, we intend to borrow tools previously designed for that field (e.g., sophisticated nonlinear projections) and expand on these tools to allow for complex evaluation procedures such as the incorporation of statistical guarantees and the consideration of threshold-sensitive classifiers  to be included. In addition to providing tools for comparing classifiers on various domains, we intend to develop tools that will allow us to organize domains into equivalence classes within which various types of classifiers are known to behave predictably. We also intend to explore the role of artificial data generation for machine learning evaluation and provide tools to generate such domains. Like recent research on ROC Analysis, our work is intended to make the evaluation process more meaningful, but unlike that research, it is intended to be easily usable and interpretable.

"Many manufacturing, service, and process-oriented companies invest large amounts of money on spare parts for equipment critical to their operations. Examples of these include mining companies, steel producers, airlines, pulp mills, oil producers, as well as many others. Lack of a critical spare part when it is needed can result in severe financial loss to the company. On the other hand, the acquisition and maintenance of spare parts is very costly. A way of calculating an optimal trade-off would be greatly beneficial to many such capital-intensive industries.

Once optimal spare parts provisioning is considered appropriate for a given industrial setting, making procurement decisions depends on several issues: an understanding of the spare part's failure distribution, the part's impact on asset performance, the possible optimization criteria, and the availability of an integrated implementation tool. The Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) Laboratory at the University of Toronto has made significant progress in all these aspects. As a result of our previous research, it is clear that there is opportunity to further enhance and extend several key aspects of this research, for example: establishing methods to verify that the required mathematical assumptions hold in a given industrial setting; extending our current models to allow for different types of failure distributions and alternative sources of spare parts; and using condition monitoring information on critical equipment to make more precise determination of the need to acquire a spare part before a failure happens.

This research will contribute to the creation of new knowledge about optimal spare part procurement. It will also help close the gap between practice and theory since the research thrusts are motivated by close collaboration with the companies who financially support the program.

"Good literacy skills are essential for full participation in our knowledge-based economy. The long-term goal of my research program is to understand the mental representations and processes involved in the comprehension of written words by both monolinguals and bilinguals, how these change with increasing reading skill, and why some children have difficulty learning to read. The work will contribute both to the development of cognitive theories of language processing and to an understanding of reading disorders.

   One focus of my research is on the mental representations and processes involved in deriving the sounds (phonology) and meanings of printed words. Phonological processing is critical to understand because it is becoming increasingly clear that it plays an important role both in learning to read and in skilled silent reading for meaning. The proposed studies will investigate how readers derive the phonological representations of multisyllabic words. Although these words make up the majority of the words that we read, most research to date has used only monosyllabic words. Another focus of my research concerns how bilinguals represent and process their two languages. Many individuals in Canada and in the rest of the world speak more than one language, yet most psycholinguistic research has been conducted on monolinguals. Consequently, theories of bilingual word recognition are less well developed than those that focus on reading in one language. A key question addressed in this proposal is whether bilinguals can selectively activate words in just one of their languages or whether activation is nonselective for language.

   In summary, the proposed research program will advance our understanding of the mental representations and processes involved in the comprehension of written words. The work will contribute to the advancement of theoretical models by extending research to multisyllabic words and to bilingual readers. Furthermore, research on phonological processing and on interactions between a bilingual's languages addresses two areas of concern for children who are having difficulties in learning to read.

"The Archaea, including methanogens, extreme halophiles and various thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms, form an evolutionarily distinct third Domain of life, separate from Bacteria and Eucarya. They were originally thought to inhabit only, so called, extreme environments. Today, however, through modern molecular biology techniques it is accepted that archaea are cosmopolitan and important contributors to various global cycles. In addition, there is strong research interest in archaea in many diverse fields including ecology, biotechnology, archaeal adaptations to extreme environments, the use of archaea as model systems for eukaryotic processes, unique archaeal-specific traits and even the role of archaea in human disease. Despite their obvious importance, for many reasons, including difficulty in cultivation and general lack of tractable genetic systems, many basic aspects of archaeal physiology, biochemistry and genetics remain poorly studied. Over the past two decades my lab has developed archaeal flagella as a model system which addresses many of these points. We have shown that, remarkably, the flagella of archaea are a unique prokaryotic motility structure, fundamentally different from bacterial flagella and instead more similar to another surface structure of bacteria, namely type IV pili, which themselves are involved in a kind of surface-dependent motility. We propose to continue and to extend our studies by identifying more genes involved in the structure and assembly of flagella including ones involved in the biosynthesis and attachment of the unusual glycan to flagella structural proteins, a step essential to their assembly. We will identify the physical interactions of various essential flagella proteins to help decipher their role in flagellation. We will begin genetic studies on another archaeal surface structure, namely pili, which we have recently demonstrated to be, again, unique in structure compared to any known bacterial pili. While continuing to examine the structure, assembly and genetics of these truly unique motility structures, we will also continue to advance the knowledge of basic archaeal biology including such fundamental processes as protein secretion and posttranslational modifications.

"Continents, Curvature and Phase Changes in Models of Mantle Convection



This proposal is concerned with the numerical simulation of convection in the Earth's mantle in various 2D and 3D geometries.  Mantle convection delivers heat to the surface of the Earth from the deep interior and mobilizes the surface in the process.  The mechanical strength of the lithosphere influences the scale of surface motions and shields the upper surface from vertical advection of heat, a form of thermal insulation; the buoyancy of continents constrains surface motions, frequently causing plates to halt and reorganize; the curvature of the mantle produces an asymmetry between the upper and lower surface areas; and mineral phase changes at depths of 410 km,  660 km and elsewhere may either enhance or inhibit convective motion depending on the sign of the associated Clapeyron slope.  Each of these factors plays a role in determining the style and efficiency of convective planetary cooling.  The long term goal of this proposal is to gain a physical understanding of the influence of each of these factors on convective motions in the mantle, and on the surface expressions of these motions.  Numerical models of mantle convection in various 2D and 3D geometries will be employed to study these effects.



With the increased processing speed of modern computers, numerical resolution in whole-mantle convection models has improved to the point where it is now possible to prescribe physical and thermal properties for continental and oceanic plates which are different from each other and from the underlying mantle.  This allows us to study the sudden and dramatic change of mechanical boundary conditions at the Earth's surface when continental plates collide - a central issue in modern geodynamics.

"Wireless Networks evolve over the years, driven by the development in radio access technology and the diversity of application demands, to 3G cellular networks, ad hoc networks, mesh networks, and more upcoming sensor networks. Diverse and evolving application requirements and usage scenarios indicate that a future wireless network would be a heterogeneous network formed by integrating the above access networks through a common platform of IP network. The objective of the proposed research is to investigate three problem areas in heterogeneous wireless networks: Routing, Mobility Management, and Network Middleware. Each of these problems is critical for future wireless networks. Also, we have opportunity of leveraging our current research and expertise in dealing with pressing issues related to these problems. Routing is a fundamental network service, which becomes complex for wireless networks due to a host of challenges related to mobility, power constraints, wireless link instability, and path interference. Smart antenna and sophisticated power control approach bring opportunities in improving link throughput and reducing the blockage of paths due to interference caused by ongoing communication in multi-hop wireless networks. However, it also brings complexity in the route control and selection process. Mobility management is critical for the performance of maintaining communication of mobile nodes. It becomes more complicated for high-speed and heterogeneous wireless networks. Conventional approach of applications accessing network services is through communication stack and socket API. Heterogeneity, mobility, ubiquity and unique characteristics of above access networks pose new challenges to the access and management of network services, which can no longer be provided by simple conventional mechanisms.  Network middleware is important in providing a platform for the implementation of sophisticated algorithms and the facilitation of application development and deployment.","Computer communications","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Jaseemuddin, Muhammad","RGPIN ","Communications networks","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",3-5
"The objectives of the proposed research is to develop new inference methods for the Compound Autoregressive (Car) models, and to explore selected  applications  of L-moment-based  estimation methods in time series.

The Car model is a conditional  Laplace transform model for nonlinear times series. It provides a convenient framework for inference on processes with non-tractable conditional density functions, that are unknown or have too complicated analytical expressions. In finance and economics, the conditional Laplace transforms often appear as functional parameters of interest, especially in the term structure of interest models, asset pricing models and optimal portfolio management models.  For these, and other potential future applications of the Car model, the availability of reliable inference methods is very important. The proposed research will address this issue, and provide  simple estimation methods and testing procedures that can be easily implemented by researchers and practitioners.

The L-moments are widely used in statistics for estimation of models for cross-sectional data in hydrology, meteorology and other fields. The proposed research  will investigate a time series application of L-moments. In particular, it will examine the properties of a new method-of-L-moment estimator for dynamic quantile models.  

In the framework of cross-sectional data, the project will examine the use of L-moments for the measurement of fund performance. The proposed L-performance measure will improve upon the Sharpe performance measure with respect to tail sensitivity and robustness.

"Sustainable energy systems are currently identified as the key strategic area in Canada, whereas the electrical energy is gaining particular importance. Developing powerful computational tools is vital due to the ever-increasing complexity of power systems, industrial automation, automotive industry, home appliances, etc. Accurate and fast simulations enable the design and operation of future electric grids and may prevent potential blackouts and system's failures. Electrical machines and power electronics are typically the modelling bottle-neck. The proposed research will continue the applicant's work on the following directions: 

We are developing computationally advanced models of synchronous and induction machines for widely used Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) simulators. The objectives are to have the models with direct interface to the external circuit while including the non-linear characteristics and enabling the most efficient solution of the network equations. Approximate models that achieve the required direct interface with the external network but do not slow the EMTP solution will be investigated. Higher fidelity models will be considered for more accurate representation of the machine dynamics and switching transients.

The detailed simulations of power electronic converters are computationally intensive due to switching and require long simulation times. We are developing dynamic average-value models that do not have switching and are particularly useful for the large-signal system-level transient studies as well as for the small-signal analysis. We are working on a pioneering computer-aided methodology for constructing such models for several classes of converters and machine-converter systems. 

Combining these thrusts under one common theme, we are well-positioned to make very significant contributions and enable the next generation of EMTP- and state-variable-based tools and programs so needed by many engineers and researches working on electrical energy systems in various industries in Canada and worldwide.

"The research proposal will focus on the development and improvement of optimization methods for solving large scale systems arising in telecommunications and in artificial intelligence. We will conduct theoretical research on the mathematical modeling and the design of efficient solution tools for large scale combinatorial systems. We will also consider particular applications, mainly in the area of communication systems and of artificial intelligence in order to apply the new enhanced tools and validate their efficiency on realistic instances. 

On the application side of telecommunication networks, we will focus on the development of enhanced tools for network design and management under unicast and multicast traffic. Indeed, with the progressive disappearance of telecommunication monopols and the decreasing cost of the bandwidth (30% per year for several years), the telecommunication industry has encountered deep transformations that led to a much more rational use of the equipment both in the core and the access networks, hence the need of optimization tools for a more efficient management of those networks. Still for the next five years, it is forecast that the traffic in the optical networks will double every year. After a gel of the investments during the last four years, the telecommunication industry is ready to reinvest in the communication infrastructures. A new generation of equipment with new features and better performances is emerging. Both for residential and industrial users, it will allow a better integration of voice, data and video with a more dynamic physical layer. Therefore, the development of efficient tools for the dimensioning of networks becomes more and more important.

On the application side in artificial intelligence, the first objective is to generalize the tols previously developed for propositional probabilistic logic to first order probabilistic logic for decidable instances. The second objective is to design efficient solution tools for automated mechanism design and apply them for the self-organization and self-management of overlay networks.

"The ionosphere, the ionized part of Earth's upper atmosphere, can significantly affect the radiowave propagation in many ways (refraction, reflection, Faraday rotation, and amplitude and phase fluctuations). Moreover, in Canada's northern regions, commercial and private aircraft rely on the high-frequency communication links and are seriously affected by the variations of the electron density. Therefore knowledge of the ionospheric electron density and the structures in it are essential for forecasting and mitigating the effects upon radio signal for application oriented systems such as communication and navigation.  Precision monitoring of the structures in the electron density of the ionosphere will also have significant implications in almost all areas of the GPS user community (navigation, control segment, and monitoring systems).  



This research describes a plan to explore and study the structures in the polar ionosphere using an array of instruments in Canada's polar region to understand the fundamental processes that generate ionization structures of different scale sizes.

"Improvements in food quality and safety of processed food are the most important features in any food processing technology that will meet the needs of the consumer and enhance competitiveness in global markets. Since Canada's agricultural and food production systems are among the most efficient and highest quality in the world, Canada needs to rise above its current global competition by developing novel processing techniques, that are not only economical but also ensure a safe and high-quality product. Food producers are looking for solutions to prevent the growth of microorganisms in food without compromising the initial quality of products. Emerging new processes are being evaluated and products have found their way to the market. Most remarkable are the preservation processes whereby products are subjected to a physical treatment at temperatures much less than those required for heat pasteurization.

This proposal addresses the issues related to the safe preservation of milk and other dairy products using a non-thermal, pulsed electric field (PEF) technology. The PEF treatment involves the application of high voltage, short duration pulses to the food, which is passed between the high voltage and ground electrodes, to induce substantially high field across the microbial cell membrane. The mode of inactivation is non-thermal, in which pulse energy is transmitted across the product through high field effect. The method is considered energy efficient, as high voltage pulses of very short duration are sufficient to induce a breakdown of a cell membrane, leading to inactivation. Some of the important benefits that can be expected with this new technology are the quality of the processed food in terms of nutritional value, flavour, taste and appearance, and extended shelf life. From a national perspective, it will enable the Canadian food-processing sector to have a technological competitive edge. Additionally, the know-how obtained in the activities under this proposal will be an asset towards the development of products using the PEF technology in other industrial applications, such as water treatment.

"The breakdown of electrical insulation while in service can cause considerable damage to the equipment and to the system to which they are connected in an integrated power grid. Indeed, the reliability of the grid depends on the system components performance. In this context, the proposal addresses the performance evaluation of Motor Winding Insulation and Outdoor Polymeric Insulation. The goals are to develop diagnostics to evaluate the material degradation and to provide solutions for improved insulation designs, and new composite materials that can withstand the stress due to today's demands for compact designs. 

Silicone rubber based polymeric insulators are presently used extensively in outdoor applications due to their light weight, ease of installation, low cost and their superior performance under polluted/wet conditions. However, these materials degrade due to discharge activities under the influence of stresses under service conditions. In order to improve their resistance to discharges, inorganic fillers like silica and aluminium oxide, are commonly used as they enhance the thermal and mechanical properties of composite insulators. Over the past few years, a great deal of attention has been given to the application of nanodielectrics in the field of electrical insulating materials. It is therefore essential to understand the basic mechanisms the nanoparticles impart to polymer matrix in an effort to develop strong nanocomposites for electrical power industry. Moreover, variable speed drives allow for more precise speed control of induction motors than older technologies; but, there have been concerns of premature failures due to insulation breakdown. The proposal addresses the effects of high switching frequencies and high dV/dt on insulation degradation with an effort to design better system.

The research facilities at the applicant's laboratory and her expertise in the above research fields will help to train highly qualified personnel to bolster Canada's research base and competitiveness in the areas of High Voltage & Insulation Engineering.

"Canada's grain handling system has evolved with the need to satisfy overseas customers in an expedient and efficient manner. To maintain Canada's reputation of exporting high-quality grain, research on methodologies to preserve the harvested grain is needed. Stored-grain bulks are ecological systems where communities of insects, mites, and micro flora interact with grain to cause spoilage. Carbon dioxide and odour volatiles from biological pests increase during spoilage can be used as a reliable indicator of incipient grain spoilage.

Measuring the air quality inside a grain bin has not been done because it is cumbersome and requires access to expensive gas analyzers. Nano and micro fabrication technologies offer the prospect of measuring carbon dioxide and odour volatiles using smart multicapable micro sensor.

The overall objective of this research is to develop a scientifically valid and commercially feasible integrated carbon dioxide-odour sensor to detect deterioration of cereal grains during storage in large bulks. The integrated sensor will be developed using polymer sensing approach and evaluated in laboratory and full-size bins. The developed micro sensor will give quick results and higher accuracy than the current methods. The advantage of this smart sensor is that, the monitoring is rapid and can be performed on-line and in situ. The sensor will be cheaper than the current technology with great functionality. These sensors could be connected to existing temperature cables to continuously monitor the air quality with unprecedented precision. The sensor will revolutionize the management of grain to preserve its quality and thus quality of processed foods made from the grain.

"The long-term objective of our research program is to reduce the qualitative and quantitative losses in cereals, oilseeds and pulses (collectively referred to as grains) during storage by developing innovative stored-grain management tools and mathematical models of stored-grain ecosystems.  A stored-grain ecosystem is a man-made ecosystem where interactions among physical, chemical and biological variables cause deterioration of grain. Thus, an enhanced understating of these interactions is critical to developing innovative management strategies to preserve grain quality. A comprehensive ecosystem model must include simulation of heat transfer; insect movement; insect population dynamics; gaseous diffusion, convection, and sorption; moisture transfer; and the production of carbon dioxide, moisture, and heat by grain and pests. 



During this study, we will determine the movement of adults and larvae of insects under temperature, moisture, and carbon dioxide gradients in the horizontal and vertical directions using columns filled with wheat; develop and validate a mathematical model of insect movement incorporating the effects of temperature, moisture and carbon dioxide gradients on their movement; develop a model of transfer of moisture from spoiling grain; determine the free-convective velocity of gases through bulks of grain; and develop and validate a comprehensive model of stored-grain ecosystems. 



The comprehensive model will permit accurate prediction of storage problems before they occur and allow action to be taken to prevent grain spoilage, and thus help the farmers, grain handlers, and grain storage managers in preserving the stored-grain, and help consulting engineers in designing proper storage systems.  In addition, the results of this research will help Canada to maintain its reputation for marketing high quality grain free of insects, pesticide residues and mycotoxins to domestic and export buyers.

"After centuries of speculation and decades of false starts, astronomers announced the first planet 

around a normal star other than the Sun in 1995. Since then, over 330 exo-planets have been 

identified, unraveling a remarkable diversity of worlds hitherto unimagined. Coincidentally, the first brown dwarf, an object that straddles the mass range between stars and planets, was also reported in 1995. Several hundred brown dwarfs are now known, in the solar neighborhood and in young star clusters. The study of exo-planets and brown dwarfs, often lumped together as ""sub-stellar objects"", has emerged as one of the most exciting and fast-moving fields of astrophysics. During the Steacie Fellowship, I propose to advance our understanding of both types of sub-stellar objects with cutting-edge observations that push the limits of some of the most powerful astronomical facilities on the ground and in space.

The proposed program will lead to fundamental advances in our understanding of stellar and sub-stellar origins, and may also pave the way for detecting giant planets around young stars.

"The radiation-induced chemistry of water under the operating conditions of both current pressurized water-cooled reactor systems (~320 �C, 10 MPa) and supercritical water (SCW) reactors in the future (~430-625 �C, 25 MPa) remains largely unknown. Direct measurements at such high temperatures and pressures, and especially beyond the critical point of water (H2O: 374 �C, 22.1 MPa), are difficult, and computer simulations are an important route of investigation. Our objective is to develop an enhanced, reliable understanding of the effects of radiation (energetic neutrons, gamma-rays, recoil protons and Oq+ ions with q = 1-8) on aqueous systems in the reactor cores, in order to develop a chemistry control strategy that minimizes corrosion and degradation of reactor components resulting from the radiolytic formation of oxidizing products such as .OH, H2O2, O2, and HO2./O2.-. Our long-term goal is to develop a benchmark SCW reactor radiolysis model using combined molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) computer simulations. This project is based on preliminary results (obtained in our laboratory) that suggest that the heterogeneous (""liquid""-like clusters surrounded by ""gas""-like regions) molecular structure of SCW might be a key to better understand water radiolysis above 374 �C. It is proposed here to use MD calculations to generate molecularly detailed configurations of SCW at selected temperatures over a wide range of densities from very dilute vapor to dense SCW, in combination with MC simulations (i) to describe the radiolysis of SCW under these specific configurations and (ii) to quantitatively determine the yields of radiolytic species for temperatures up to 625 �C. Exciting developments that will also be made with our model calculations include the effects of pH, added solutes (such as H2 and other .OH scavengers, dissolved O2) and their concentrations, dose rate, as well as the effects of multiple ionization and fragmentation of water molecules under high-LET irradiation.  This project will benefit from our long experience in the radiation chemistry of water and in the use of stochastic MC techniques applied to liquid water radiolysis under a variety of experimental conditions.

"Les infections alimentaires d'origine virale repr�sentent de nos jours une pr�occupation majeure pour les secteurs alimentaires et de la sant�. Ces infections sont responsables d'une tr�s forte morbidit� � travers le monde et engendrent des pertes �conomiques consid�rables.

"Les virus ent�riques et notamment les norovirus sont maintenant reconnus mondialement comme �tant la majeure cause de maladies d'origine alimentaire. Deux causes majeures expliqueraient la recrudescence des cas d'empoisonnements alimentaires d'origine virale: leur tr�s grande persistance dans les aliments facilitant leur transfert et leur r�sistance � la majorit� des approches utilis�es pour la lutte contre ces microorganismes pathog�nes. Plusieurs �tudes sont rapport�es dans la litt�rature sur la survie et l'inactivation des bact�ries pathog�nes dans les aliments. Cependant, tr�s peu d'�tudes sont rapport�es concernant la persistance et le contr�le des virus ent�riques notamment les norovirus. Cette situation est essentiellement due � l'absence de m�thodes pour la culture in vitro de ce groupe de virus. Bien que les fruits de mer soient les aliments les plus �tudi�s, d'autres aliments notamment les aliments pr�ts-�-manger et fortement manipul�s demeurent probl�matiques et peuvent �tres largement impliqu�s dans la transmission des norovirus � l'humain.

"The study of the aperiodic autocorrelation properties of binary sequences began in the 1950s and continues to be centrally important in diverse areas, including radar information processing, power control for multicarrier wireless transmission, optical time domain reflectometry, medical ultrasound, and other digital transmission systems. Sequences and arrays whose aperiodic autocorrelations are collectively small in relation to the sequence or array size correspond to signals whose transmission wastes very little energy and which can be recovered efficiently at the receiver. 



Traditionally, the analysis of autocorrelation properties has concentrated on the periodic case, where the presence of rich mathematical structure admits many theoretical techniques. But the aperiodic case is much more significant in practice because it arises naturally in so many application contexts. Although conventional wisdom has long been that aperiodic autocorrelations display little structure, and that often the only realistic means of analysis is computer search, there have been several recent indications to the contrary.



The short-term objectives of the program are to study particular classical problems in this area for which recent results have opened up new research directions. The long-term objective is to identify emerging methods, and develop new ones, for studying aperiodic autocorrelations of large sequences and arrays. This is becoming increasingly important, as modern digital communications systems are less likely to be restricted to the use of smaller sequences and arrays. The general scientific approach will be to combine tools and insights from discrete mathematics, computing science, and digital communications engineering. Where appropriate, experimental computation will be used to reveal patterns, identify key examples, improve intuition, and so point the way to new theoretical results.

"Catastrophic caldera-forming eruptions during which thousands of cubic kilometers of very viscous and crystal-rich magma is erupted explosively over a time scale of days to weeks are among the most awesome natural phenomena on Earth. Such events have occurred intermittently throughout Earth's history in places such as the Yellowstone caldera, USA and in the Taupo volcanic zone, New Zealand.  Magmas feeding these so-called ""supervolcanic eruptions"" are thought to be driven from high-level chambers, in part, by a time-dependent piston-like foundering of a dense chamber roof into an underlying laterally-extensive molten or partially-molten magma chamber of lower density. Whereas the volumes of such eruptions are perhaps not surprising, as they are expected to proceed until most or all buoyant magma is expelled, an explanation for the extreme rate of eruption remains one of the most compelling problems in volcanology.  In detail, the physical problem governing the rate of eruption is analogous to the rapid compaction and disaggregation of a strong, deformable porous medium constructed of a solid crystalline matrix and a viscous interstitial pore fluid.  The inherent mechanical difficulty with disrupting and expelling such a material places restrictive demands on the underlying magma chamber processes. This proposal uses a novel combination of field observations, laboratory fluid dynamics experiments, theoretical work and numerical simulations to identify and understand the magma chamber dynamics that enable such a large volume of crystal-rich material to be erupted so quickly.","Earth sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Earth and Ocean Sciences","Jellinek, Mark","RGPIN ","Earth science (see also marine geology 4604)","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",2-5

"Structural health monitoring (SHM) are increasingly being investigated by the aerospace and other industries such as nuclear power as it enables the adoption of condition-based maintenance and modern aircraft designs resulting in enhanced safety with more eco-efficient designs and cost reductions. Their implementation depends on the availability of SHM sensors which can be integrated onto or embedded into metallic and graphite/epoxy composite structures and materials to report on their integrity in real-time. The sensors should be rugged, feasible for curved surfaces and sustain high and low operation temperatures. 



The biomedical imaging technology is well used to diagnose human health conditions non-intrusively and non-destructively inside the hospital or clinic. One critical demand is to develop sensors, techniques and systems for the out-patient diagnostics such as at the patient's home. Flexible sensor in array form to conform to human body shapes can be used to perform real-time imaging in high resolutions or other diagnostic functions convenient to the patients and with cost-effectiveness. It is the desire to perform R&D on wearable flexible sensors.



Since ultrasound has the capability to perform diagnosis of the interiors of the opaque structures and materials and of humans therefore the objectives of this proposal are to develop integrated and flexible piezoelectric/ultrasonic sensors in wide temperature ranges and with different fabrication methods and materials and investigate ultrasonic theories and techniques to use sensor arrays for health monitoring of aerospace and other structures and for biomedical real-time imaging and monitoring applications.

"Hybrid maintenance systems: architecture, strategy, and performance evaluation models:

Performance of manufacturing systems depends on safe, reliable and productive operations of assets that are related to maintenance activities. These activities are associated with cost, which is accounted for 30 to 50 percent of direct costs. Thus, any improvement in maintenance systems can have a significant contribution to reducing this cost. On the other hand, saving in maintenance cost may result in poor performance of equipment and increase of the significant factors such as system waste and emissions (e.g., gases, radiations, sound, and dust), and system energy and materials consumption. Thus, the necessity of having effective and efficient maintenance systems and performance evaluation tools become more important. This research proposal aims at developing hybrid maintenance systems including architecture, strategy, and performance evaluation models. More specifically the objectives of this development are: 1) to develop hybrid maintenance architecture. This architecture will be designed based on virtual maintenance cells using maintenance matrix and an efficient skill-equipment-task grouping technique. Later, the functional model that includes all processes related to maintenance cells, data flow diagrams, input and output analysis will be developed, 2) to develop the maintenance strategy. This strategy provides a set of guidelines to optimize maintenance systems based on an interactive message-oriented relief process in conjunction with the self-healing mechanism. This strategy will take into account significant factors, 3) to develop a performance evaluation model. This model aims at extending available methods to evaluate and quantify the relative efficiency of the cells of the hybrid maintenance system. The quantified evaluation result points out the detailed maintenance limitation of relatively less efficient cells so that the maintenance system can make the corresponding improvement scheme, and 4) to train HQP and publish research papers. This proposal will involve students at graduate and undergraduate levels as research students and assistant, to contribute to the objectives and publish papers.","Manufacturing processes and products","Manufacturing processes and products","Mechanical and Industrial Engineering","Jenab, Kouroush","RGPIN ","Industrial engineering","Industrial engineering","G�nie industriel",2-5

The ability to construct high fidelity complex surface models of structures using 3d sensors is an enabling technology. When coupled with appropriate algorithms to merge together models obtained over larger geographical extents these sensors can be used to build complex models of structures from archaeological treasures to crime scenes and from industrial parts to sculpture. Although these sensors and their corresponding algorithms can produce extremely large complex models the models that they produce are not always directly usable by other agents. They contain very little semantic information about the structures scanned beyond physical surface properties. Yet it is the semantic properties of these scans  the foreground object, specific components of the object ~ that are often the reason for the object being scanned in the first place. How can these scans be manipulated so as to segment the salient components of the scans? How can these components be represented so that queries of the salient components of these scans can be handled efficiently and effectively? How can this information be used in a timely fashion in order to guide the process of scan acquisition? Building upon an existing research collaboration between MDA and York University, this project investigates issues related to the segmentation, representation, retrieval and manipulation of semantic objects from 3D sensor scans of extended physical environments.

"Objectives of the proposed research program

   This research is a systematic biomechanical analysis of the dynamic interactions between the shoe, orthotic and foot during functional activities.

   The number of prescriptions is rapidly expanding for orthotics worn within the shoe in the conservative treatment of various musculoskeletal disorders.  However, this is happening with very little understanding of the actual biomechanics of these devices and their influence on walking gait and other functional activities.  Orthotics range from simple arch supports and heel wedges to more complex rigid or articulating devices that cross the ankle and subtalar joints.  All are designed to alter the loading and motion of articulations of the foot or ankle in some way.  However, there has been no systematic biomechanical analysis of these devices.

   Limited numbers of studies have demonstrated the influence of orthotics on chronic musculoskeletal disorders (such as osteoarthritis).  Influences include the reduction of joint loads and alteration of joint kinematics.  But other studies on the same devices have found no influence whatever.  This research program aims to address this deficiency in biomechanical understanding.



There are three objectives:

1) Establish the correct reference position for the foot when shaping an orthotic.

program is well placed to determine the correct position.

2) Systematically quantify the biomechanical effects of current orthotic designs. 

3) Design novel, more effective orthotics and prove their overall effectiveness in large groups.

"In multicellular organisms, embryonic development is dependent on a continuous flow of information through a complex network of cells. The ability of signaling machinery to integrate multiple upstream signals is critical in the control of cellular behavior. However, these mechanisms are still poorly understood. Rho GTPases together with proteins regulating their enzymatic activity (regulators), are signal transduction proteins involved downstream of a wide range of receptors. They are consequently considered as key players in cell signaling integration. However, despite extensive effort, functional characterization of individual GTPases and regulators has not been able to describe how these genes coordinate their function in order to integrate intercellular signals. To address this issue, we will use the microscopic hearth worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, as a model system to produce a spatiotemporal map of Rho-specific regulatory machineries controlling embryonic development. To do so, we will develop an integrative genomics approach consisting in the generation and integration of complementary layers of biological information. Our integrative approach will produce the first dynamic model of Rho GTPase regulation in a multicellular organism. This model will be subsequently used as a backbone to better understand how interaction of Rho-regulatory machineries with upstream and downstream signaling modules could direct cell signaling integration events during embryonic development. Construction of such a model will significantly contribute to a comprehensive mapping of cell signaling events during complex and dynamic biological processes. Moreover, Rho GTPases and their regulators are extremely well conserved between nematode and human. They are also involved in number of human pathologies. Our research program will consequently provide the scientific community with dynamic models that could be used to better understand the behavior of cell signaling machineries during normal human development as well as in pathological context.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge",Chimie,"Jenna, Sarah","RGPIN ","Developmental genetics",Genetics,"G�n�tique",3-3

"Water plays an essential role in the formation and behaviour of igneous rocks. However, in spite of its importance there are only a limited number of determinations of water contents in melt inclusions. Melt inclusions occur in a variety of mineral types and form an excellent vessel for the preservation of primary, or least degassed, water contents. Recent developments in confocal Raman spectroscopy show that it is an excellent tool for quantification of water contents. The aim of this study is to use Raman spectrometry and other in situ analytical techniques to study the origin of mantle-derived magmas through time. The data obtained will help constrain the evolution of the Earth System and lithosphere-hydrosphere interactions.

"Production of hydrocarbons from the subsurface is often an inefficient process.  Typically only 10 - 25% of available oil can be recovered unless a fluid (water, gas, CO2) is injected into the reservoir.  Fluid injection, however, raises recovery costs, energy consumption, and poses challenges of its own.

     Most injection projects lead to some surprises; production wells near injectors are among the last to respond to the injection while distant producers respond more quickly.  This disparity is caused by the geological distribution of the reservoir properties and results in uneven sweep of the hydrocarbons, leading to poor and/or prolonged periods of low recovery, and unnecessary water production, requiring energy for treatment and disposal.  Understanding the reservoir property distribution is key to achieving high recoveries with minimal environmental impact.

     The purpose of this research is to reduce uncertainty about interwell communication to aid efficient injection design and management.  If successful, the research will provide a method for quantitatively determining the extent of interwell communication using commonly available rate data, giving information about the flow paths within a reservoir.  Benefits of a robust, efficient connectivity estimator include

1. A tool to infer or validate a geological model which enhances understanding of the important geological factors of the reservoir.

2.  A means to adjust injector-producer balance in oil recovery processes, reducing the risk of wasting injection fluid and energy and improving recovery efficiency.

3.  A method to allocate oil and gas production from a producer back to the injector causing that production, aiding economic evaluations of recovery strategies.

4.  A quantitative estimator of connectivity versus interwell distance, supporting risk evaluations for efficient design of drilling programs which recover bypassed oil.

"In the past decade, it has become clear that the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, QCD, has an unexpectedly rich phase structures. At temperatures exceeding two trillion Kelvins, quarks and gluons normally confined in strongly interacting particles (hadrons) are freed to form a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). At densities exceeding 10 times that of the normal nuclear matter but at very low temperatures, the matter may exhibit color (the charges of the QCD) superconductivity in various forms. The focus of my studies have been the high temperature part of this phase structure - the QGP phase.



Since 2000, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory has been colliding heavy ions at relativistic energies in an attempt to create the necessary conditions for the QGP formation. By now, we have accumulated ample evidence for the creation of this hot and dense soup of quarks and gluons. However, this new state of matter turned out to exhibit a number of unexpected behaviors. The most surprising perhaps is the strength of the interaction among the ingredients of the QGP. This fact opens up many theoretical possibilities which are yet to be thoroughly and comprehensively studied.



In this proposal, my focus is on the first-principle characterization of the history of the heavy

ion collisions before, during and after the formation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma to unravel the

mysteries of the strongly interacting QGP.

This will show how molecules, that play a role in cell division, associate and bind to the inner wall of the bacterial envelope.  The AFM will also be used to measure the binding of proteins on the surface of live bacteria with  appropriate antibodies attached to the tip of the AFM, with the aim to produce maps of the distribution of proteins on the bacterial surface. Furthermore, high resolution imaging of the stress bearing layer in the bacterial wall will be performed in order to resolve the long standing questions concerning the detailed molecular architecture of this cell component. The layer gives the cell stability against the internal pressure but the layer must also allow molecular traffic through the cell wall.  It is therefore important for an understanding of cell function and also for the development of antimicrobial agents to discover the correct architecture of this stress bearing layer. Digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) with visible light has achieved sub micron resolution. Our research will extend DIHM measurements into the infrared which will open up potentially new application areas in soft matter research and medicine.","Physical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Physics and Atmospheric Science","Jericho, Manfred","RGPIN ","Soft condensed matter","Condensed matterphysics","Physique de la mati�re condens�e",3-5
"OBJECTIVES AND APPROACH. I propose experimental and theoretical studies on the adsorption of prochiral/chiral organic molecules on achiral/chiral Pt(hkl) electrodes, and the mechanism and kinetics of their electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH). I will perform T-dependent studies and will determine the surface coverage of hydrogen (H), anions (AN), and organic molecules (ORG). I will determine thermodynamic state functions for H and ORG adsorption. The products of ECH, their yields, and enantiomeric excesses will be examined using vapor-phase chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and circular dichromism. I will investigate the under-potential deposition (UPD) of Ag and Cu on Pt(hkl), Au(hkl) and Rh(hkl) electrodes. The surface coverage of Ag and Cu will be examined by application of electrochemical techniques. I will conduct T-dependent cyclic-voltammetry (CV) studies and perform theoretical data analysis to determine the substrate-adsorbate bond energy. I will analyze the influence of electrochemical interface on the interfacial bonding of metals. I will investigate the biocorrosion and biocompatibility of colored passive layers on titanium-molybdenum alloy (TMA) and nickel-titanium alloy (NiTi) in simulated body fluids. I will also study the adsorption of model proteins on these materials using complementary physical and analytical techniques.



SIGNIFICANCE. The outcome of this research will provide molecular-level understanding of electrochemical reactions and will shed light on interfacial thermodynamics. It will explain the adsorption of prochiral/chiral organic molecules on achiral/chiral surfaces in relation to their mutual geometry and size. It will explain the metal-metal bonding in nanometric layers prepared by electrochemical techniques and their adhesion to various substrates under electrochemical conditions. The study on passive layers on TMA and NiTi will facilitate the preparation of new materials of enhanced biocompatibility and reduced biocorrosion in simulated body fluids. The cross-disciplinary research will train HQP that will enter the Canadian job market.

"To discover genes that are required for embryonic development we used a forward genetic screen to identify mouse mutants that were abnormal at E9.5 and dead prior to birth.   The 99J line was identified in this recessive N-Ethyl-nitrous-urea (ENU) screen and therefore the gene mutated in this line is required for normal development.  99J homozygous mutant embryos are developmentally delayed as early as E8.5 and die by E12.5.  At E9.5 these mutants have a failure of chorioallantoic attachment and labyrinth development.  We mapped the 99J mutation to mouse chromosome 5F and identified a single point mutation,point mutation in the first exon of transmembrane emp24 domain trafficking protein 2 (p24beta/Tmed2 herein referred to as Tmed2).  This mutation results in a non-synonymous substitution of an alanine to glutamic acid in the signal sequence of TMED2.  We have also found that this mutation results in a significant decrease in TMED2 expression in 99J homozygous mutant embryos. 

TMED proteins, 10 of which has been identified in vertebrate, form oligomeric complexes which interact with newly synthesized proteins and coat-complex protein (COP) to facilitate quality control and transport between the ER and Golgi. Therefore, dysfunctions in these processes are most likely responsible for abnormal placental development in the 99J mutant line.  My hypothesis is that Tmed2 is required for normal movement of specific proteins from the ER to the Golgi during placental development. The goal of my proposal is to determine how mutation in Tmed2 and abnormal ER and Golgi protein movement contribute to the failure of placental development in the 99J ENU line.

"This proposal addresses several distinct but related families of questions in the general area of

nonlinear analysis, all having potential applications to problems in areas such as mathematical physics, statistics, and geometry. One of the main goals is to establish clear geometric descriptions of solutions of nonlinear field theories, in certain asymptotic limits. For example, a number of nonlinear field theories  relevant to the description of the large-scale structure of the universe --- one example is an equation known as the Abelian Higgs model --- are thought to support structures known as ""cosmic strings"", and it is widely believed by physicists that the evolution of an isolated cosmic string is described by a geometric  equation called the Minkowski minimal surface equation.  Providing a mathematical proof of this scenario is a goal of this proposal, and example of what is meant by a clear geometric description in an asymptotic limit.



Another major goal of this proposal is to develop mathematical tools suitable for the geometric description of non-smooth objects, such as a crumpled sheet of paper. Classically, geometry is concerned with describing manifolds (for example, curved 2-dimensional surfaces) in terms of quantities such as various kinds of curvature, and classical theories apply to manifolds that are smooth, so that the curvatures vary continuously from point to point. In this framework, there are classical theorems that allow one to  answer questions about global properties of a manifold --- for example, is the manifold flat? --- in terms of local  curvatures. (Here, we say that a manifold is flat if we can make an exact model of it out of a a piece of paper, one that we are allowed to bend, as long as it is not folded or crumpled. A sphere is an example of a manifold that is not flat.) Analogous questions become much harder to answer, or even to formulate, if we allow ourselves to consider manifolds that are not smooth, which is like considering paper that can be folded or crumpled. Surprisingly, the mathematical tools needed for this sort of question are also relevant for some problems arising from statistics.

"The goal of this collaborative project is the development of novel and potentially high impact methods for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy planning in cancer - the end user of our research outcomes will be the clinical oncologist. We will achieve this goal by synergistically combining two recent conceptual advancements in medicine and engineering: the cancer stem cell hypothesis and the development of lineage informatics for in vitro clonal lineage tracking and analysis. Sophisticated robotic microscopes and informatics software developed in the laboratory of Jervis will be used to investigate the lineage tree structure and dynamic phenotype trajectories of human tumor stem cell lines and primary cells derived from tumor biopsy samples. The human cell lines have already received significant in vivo analysis in mouse models, so the tumor initiating properties of these cell lines in well defined. Correlation and pattern recognition analysis will be used to develop classification schemes for observed lineage trees and phenotypes with respect to in vivo mouse experiments and final disposition of the original tumor cell source patient.

The source, maintenance, and clonal expansion of tumor stem cells is of central importance in the advancement of cancer therapy. The nature of these cells and the formulation of new methods by which they may be killed or differentiated in vivo will undoubtedly have significant impact on future cancer therapies. Recent evidence suggests that the severity of a given malignancy can be significantly reduced if the tumor stem cells can be depleted from a tumor. Thus methods are urgently needed to aid in the characterization of these cells. Because of the stem cell nature of these cells, much of the analysis must be carried out at the single cell/clone level as we propose herein.

"Preamble: Characterization of cells and the development of clonal lineage heterogeneity through differentiation and epigenetic drift poses many fundamental challenges at the heart of bioprocess and tissue engineering. There is an urgent and specific need for the development of nondestructive multi-parameter analytical technologies that can assess cellular dynamics along trajectories that span multiple generations.   

   

Objectives: The long term objective of my laboratory is to develop bioengineering strategies that enables the optimization and characterization of bioprocesses and products at the level of the individual cell.  Bioengineering at this level of detail requires robotic microscopy, single cell handling and manipulation, and an informatics approach to data analysis.  We hypothesized that cellular behavior analysis performed using long-term high resolution live-cell imaging will provide sufficient measures to enable culture control schemes that direct the development of individual cells along specific differentiation trajectories. Classification and control schemes will be limited only by the spatial-temporal-spectral resolution of imaging and the robustness of dynamic behavior and cell appearance identification.    

 

Approach:  The work performed in this project will involve continued development and optimization of mechanical and photonic manipulation of individual cells for bio-assembly;  the implementation of multidimensional bright field and fluorescence time course imaging using high precision microscope robotics; the formulation of algorithms and software to analyze the multivariate data produced during extended time course imaging.  Each of these components will now be integrated into a robotic-imaging bioreactor system to enable the tracking and analysis of hundreds to thousands of cells at resolutions in which details are observable for each cell over time.



Novelty:  The integration of high-content multidimensional live-cell imaging with informatics and single cell manipulation robotics and photonics represents a highly novel platform for biological discovery and the development of advanced bioprocess engineering methodologies.  Further, the application of lineage informatics for the analysis of cells represents an entirely new level of detail in culture analysis - cultures are not analyzed in terms of gross parameter measurements, but rather parameters are estimated and tracked at the single cell scale over multiple generations.  This work anticipates manufacturing challenges that will arise as cells are used for transplant therapy and single-cell analysis becomes a requirement.  As such, the proposed research program has the potential to develop fundamental methods and strategies that will find wide application in the areas of cell therapy and cell-based pharmaceutical manufacturing.

"Although silicon is unquestionably the dominant material for microelectronics technology, it has never been considered to be the obvious best choice for photonic devices.  The III-V semiconductors, glasses and ferroelectrics all have established roles in photonics and in many respects outperform silicon.  However, there is great potential for cost reduction if the established infrastructure of the microelectronics industry can be applied to photonic device manufacturing.  The ultimate goal of silicon photonics research is to establish a platform for integrated optical circuits that is compatible with the existing technology for manufacturing microelectronic chips and will lead to a merger of the two technologies. 



The objective of this research proposal is to contribute to this larger goal in three areas.  First, we will work on the development of discrete silicon-based nanophotonic components.  Our current work on narrow band filters and couplers based on grating structures will continue.  We will extend this to include tunable filters employing ring resonator structures, which use small waveguide loops to resonantly select out narrow spectral bands for which the loop length is an integer number of wavelengths.  Second, we will continue to collaborate with researchers at McMaster, Carleton and NRC on developing techniques for the monolithic integration of photonic and electronic devices on a single silicon chip.  Finally, we will develop new types of optical sensors that exploit silicon photonic technologies and address the needs of industrial partners who have identified specific applications for which conventional electrical sensors are not suitable.  We will make temperature, strain and vibration sensors consisting of small silicon waveguide chips that are coupled to optical fibers for optical interrogation.

"A typical internal combustion engine for a diesel transport truck converts about 30% of the fuel energy to moving the vehicle while 65% is lost as waste heat. We propose that this heat could be converted directly to electrical energy through a thermally regenerative fuel cell (TRFC). This device uses heat to remove hydrogen from a liquid compound and then recombines the hydrogen with the compound in a fuel cell to make electricity. It is a closed loop system in which the liquid compound and the hydrogen are continually recycled. The high electrical power loads in transports are, at present, satisfied by batteries supplied by the alternator. The relatively low efficiency of the alternator results in poor use of fuel for the electricity to the battery. Therefore, generation of electricity from the waste heat, using a TRFC, would increase fuel efficiency. Challenges in the project are both in chemistry and in engineering. The chemistry challenge is to identify a catalyst and a fluid that give very selective dehydrogenation (and subsequent rehydrogenation in the fuel cell), so that the fluid does not quickly degrade. The engineering challenges are the design of the fuel cell to handle the unconventional oxidant and the design of the rest of the system to ensure maximum heat collection and conversion to useable electricity. If successful, this low grade waste heat conversion system could find use in a number of wide ranging applications. Benefits to Canada would be increased fuel efficiency in trucks, development of uniquely Canadian energy-saving technology, and the training of HQP (4 graduate students, a postdoctoral fellow and a research associate).","Energy storage and conversion","Energy resources",Chemistry,"Jessop, Philip","STPGP ","Catalysis, kinetics","Physical chemistry","Chimie physique",1-3
"Surfactants such as soaps and detergents are chemicals that stabilize oil/water mixtures called emulsions.  Emulsions are often desirable in the energy industry during oil production, environmental cleanup, and other applications.  However, after the emulsions are used, the emulsion must be ""broken"" or separated into its oil and water components.  The surfactant that helped stabilize the emulsion then becomes a liability because it makes it hard to break the emulsion.  The surfactant is also a liability because it will cause environmental problems once the water is discarded.  These disadvantages could be eliminated by the design and implementation of switchable surfactants.  

A switchable surfactant can be reversibly converted into a molecule that is not a surfactant, upon application of some kind of trigger.  In order for the surfactant to be truly switchable, the inactive form of the molecule must be convertible back into the surface-active form by the application of another trigger or removal of the first trigger.  The proposed work will explore switchable surfactants as a new approach to surfactant design that should facilitate emulsion breaking.  The work will emphasize applications in the energy industry.  Most importantly, the switchable surfactants will use inexpensive and safe reagents to trigger the switching of the surfactant; these triggers will be air and recycled CO2.  In contrast, the cleavable and switchable surfactants in the literature require acids, bases, ozone, or irradiation.

"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a readily available, extremely inexpensive reagent for organic synthesis primarily because it is a waste material.  CO2 produced as a byproduct from power plants is available on a far larger scale than traditional forms of biomass feedstocks (starch, sucrose, cellulose, oils).  The very low price, very high availability, and low toxicity of CO2 are strong motivating factors for pursuing new uses of CO2.  It is the long-term goal of my research to develop many applications of waste CO2.  When used as a reagent, CO2 typically replaces phosgene or carbon monoxide, both of which are more expensive and very toxic.  The conversion of CO2 to value-added products is currently practiced for only a few products (methanol, polycarbonates, propylene carbonate, urea, and salicylic acid).  Syntheses of some other products from CO2 have been demonstrated but not yet industrialized, and many others are no doubt possible.  I propose to investigate several new syntheses using CO2 and to focus on specific problems that are preventing further adoption of CO2 fixation.

     Compounds that will be synthetic targets include fine chemicals such as ureas, acylureas, �-hydroxycarboxylic acids, aminoacids, alkoxyacids, chiral amines, and several other products.  These chemicals are useful in pharmaceuticals, pesticides, inks, and other products of chemical manufacturing.

     The students involved in the research will gain experience in fine chemical synthesis and in designing chemical processes so that they have minimum impact on the environment.

     This work is part of a larger effort to increase the ""green-ness"" of chemical manufacturing.  The recycling of waste products such as CO2 is far better for the environment (and for the health of workers) than the use of toxic reagents such as carbon monoxide and phosgene.

"Plants and animals alike have to cope with stress imposed by their environment, for example through climatic extremes. However, unlike animals, plants cannot evade adverse conditions by simply moving away, but have to withstand them where they grow. Land plants have evolved a fascinating repertoire of protective devices, including a skin that protects their huge surface against insects and pathogens, against dirt and rain, as well as against sunburns and desiccation. How do plants achieve all these goals using a single, extremely versatile, durable and lightweight material? It has been known for some time that all these properties are due to a wax coating that covers the plant skin. However, it is currently not clear how this material is formed and how exactly it determines the surface properties. Consequently, it is not possible to harness our crops against adverse conditions that are limiting harvests in many parts of Canada and against conditions that are expected to dramatically deteriorate in the future due to climate change. 



We will perform experiments that will allow us to understand how plant surfaces function. In particular, we will focus on the role of one prominent class of wax compounds in one central function of the surface, namely the role of triterpenoids to seal the plant tissue against excessive water loss. Our objectives are to 1) investigate the composition, formation and deposition of triterpenoids near or at the plant surface, 2) manipulate their amounts, and 3) study whether the changes in composition will affect the sealing properties of the wax. We hope that our experiments will show triterpenoids to play an important, but indirect role in sealing the plant tissue. They might function in making the relatively rough surface of the outermost plant cell walls smooth, so that a very thin film of other wax compounds will suffice to prevent excessive water loss. If this idea is confirmed by our experiments, then the same principles can be used to enhance crop quality, ultimately benefitting Canadian society through an improved food supply.","Agriculture and primary food production","Agriculture and primary food production",Botany,"Jetter, Reinhard","RGPIN ","Plant and treebiology","Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",2-5

"In today's competitive markets, a company able to fill customer orders quickly, as well offer a variety of custom products will have an advantage.  However, these goals place conflicting pressures on manufacturers.   To fill orders quickly requires firms to carry finished goods inventory - but this carries a risk of holding in inventory items not suitable for customer orders.  To provide custom products, firms typically produce items only when the customer places an order.  This reduces the risk of not selling items made ahead of time, but causes longer customer lead times.  For this reason,  many firms use a hybrid approach.  They produce semi-finished goods ahead of customer demand (make-to-stock), and then customize the semi-finished goods when customer orders materialize (make-to-order).   The first thrust area of this research deals with enhancing our understanding of production systems where products are made in this hybrid fashion.   The focus is on exploring the use of various inventory control policies and production structures for these hybrid systems. 

    The second thrust area of this research deals with ambulance offload delays.  In Canada, ambulance offload times (the time it takes to offload a patient from an ambulance to the acute care unit of the emergency department) is a growing concern.  A patient arriving by ambulance cannot be removed from the vehicle unless there is an acute care bed in the ER department available.  When no beds are available, the patient is given care in the ambulance by the paramedics that staff the ambulance.  This results in reduced service levels to the general public.  In fact, the City of Toronto had over 1000 hours with unacceptable ambulance coverage levels in a two month period in 2006.  Furthermore, excessive offload times cost the Toronto EMS just short of $4M in 2006 due to overtime pay for paramedics (Suthons, 2007).  This research will explore the complex relationship between the number of ambulances, management of ER beds,  patient response times and offload times.  It will also look at the impact of having more, or fewer, inpatient beds in the hospital.  These models will help healthcare managers to assess where best to allocate limited resources.

"We don't realize it, but the electrical outlet at our homes is actually a gateway to one of the largest and most complex objects ever built ! The electricity transmission system is one of the greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century. It is an extensive system of interconnected networks in which high voltage power lines transport electricity from generators to customers. Our standard of  living depends on reliable, low-cost and high-quality availability of energy.  However, unforeseen events occur  that can disturb the reliable supply of electrical energy. Remember the blackout of August 2003 ! This caused significant hardship to the people and a great loss to the economy. It started with a high voltage transmission line sagging on to a tree. Disconnection of one transmission line caused other lines to carry more power and this resulted in a 'domino' effect resulting in cascading outages and blackout.  This potential danger is always present and Engineers are looking for ways to make the electrical grid more 'robust' to these possible disturbances. The approach to tackle this problem is referred to in general as 'Security Enhancement'. 



The main goal of this research is to develop tools that will help to enhance the overall security of the power grid. It is proposed to use methods based on advanced mathematical approach (such as optimization) and methods based on 'Artificial Intelligence'. These tools  by themselves or through the power system operator implement control actions at the appropriate time. As a result, the impact of unforeseen events on the power system will be minimized and we can continue to enjoy the benefits of a reliable supply of electrical energy. 

This research is significant considering the role Canada can play in the North American energy market. The leadership and progress of Canada in the technological world depends to a large extent on a reliable and secure infrastructure that can continue to supply high quality electrical energy. The proposed research is to make a valuable contribition to achieve these goals.

"Canada has the world's greatest repository of hydrocarbon resources, a large portion of them are bitumen in oil-sand.  Upgrading bitumen to crude oil produces waste such as fluid coke.  In Alberta alone the production of oil-sand fluid coke exceeds 10000 tonnes per day.  Due to its high sulphur content, all fluid coke produced is being added to the existing stockpiles (over 50 million tonnes). Given the increasing importance of oil sand in Canada's energy portfolio, the production of petroleum coke will increase.  As more sulphur is being rejected to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulations for low-sulphur transportation fuel, an increase in the coke sulphur content is also anticipated. The high sulphur content of oil sand petroleum coke limits its use as a fuel due to the need to provide expensive flue gas cleanup.  Canada is also a major producer of a range of non-ferrous metals such as Cu and Ni.  Metallurgical processes often produce flue gases containing sulphur dioxide - a precursor of acid rain.  With the support from NSERC, we developed a new technology - SOactive process which captures sulphur dioxide in a salable form and, at the same time converts the waste coke to a novel active carbon (ECOcarbon) - a highly valuable material that has a range of environmental and industrial applications.  This proposed research is to optimize the structure and chemistry of ECOcarbon for it best performance in several areas: as a sorbent material for controlling mercury emission from coal-fired power plants and metal smelters and for air and water purification; as an electric energy storage material for increased energy efficiency and for reduced the green house gas emissions.  Another line of research is environmental applications of ionic liquids - a new class of materials that are considered to be ""green"" for their extremely low volatility.  Our long term goal is to develop novel ionic liquid-based technologies for capturing green house gas and acid gas in a much more energy efficient way.  We believe the anticipated advance in our research will help this country become a world leader in sustainable energy and metal production, create high-pay jobs, and improve the quality of life of all Canadian.

"Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (i.e. the addition and removal of phosphate groups) is probably the most crucial chemical reaction taking place in living organisms.  It is the basis for the regulatory control of many diverse biological events triggered by extracellular effectors.  Moreover, it is a universal element of intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in the control of metabolism, gene expression, cell division and differentiation, development, contraction, transport, locomotion, and learning and memory.  Phosphatases remove the phosphate group from phospho-containing substrates, including both small molecules and proteins, while kinases are involved in their addition.  



The long-term objective of this research proposal is to advance our understanding of the structure-function relationship of phosphatases/kinases, which are vital for many cellular processes. Specifically, we aim to understand the mechanisms of (de)phosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases, as well as, the structural basis for substrate recognition and specificity.  The specific objectives of this proposal are: 1) structural determination of the bifunctional enzyme, AceK (containing both kinase and phosphatase activities), which is the first phosphorylating system found in bacteria, both in its native state and in complex with its natural substrate, isocitrate dehydrogenase; 2) extensive structural and functional characterization of myosin heavy chain kinase, a novel threonine-specific kinase involved in the control of contractility; 3) systematic characterization of Ham1/Maf pyrophosphatases and their specificity for ""abnormal"" nucleotides which allows them to serve a ""house-cleaning"" role in the cell.  In all these studies, a combination of biochemical, biophysical and structural techniques will be utilized to uncover the structural basis and molecular mechanisms underlying substrate specificity, catalyitic activity and functional diversity.  As such, it will be a means of providing high quality, diverse training to the trainees in our laboratory.","Human pharmaceuticals","Manufacturing processes and products",Biochemistry,"Jia, Zongchao","RGPIN ",Biochemistry,Biochemistry,Biochimie,2-5

"The Earth is unique among the terrestrial planets in the solar system in that it has plate tectonics - the uppermost 150 to 250km thick layer (called the lithosphere) consists of many ""plates"" moving relative to each other above the underlying mantle. Plate movement causes earthquakes and volcanoes and is responsible for the formation of mountain belts and ocean basins. Human beings live on the lithosphere and derive energy, mineral, and other resources from it. Despite its close relationship to humanity, it remains incompletely understood how the continental lithosphere deforms in response to plate movement over long time (more than millions of years) and vast space (comparable to the size of a continent like the North America) scales. Two complementary approaches are applied to advance our understanding: One involves laboratory experiments on lithospheric materials under as close to natural conditions as possible. The other which is the one followed by this applicant is to study the ""signatures"" of ancient lithospheric deformation recorded in rocks which are called ""deformation structures"", and to model the development of these structures by computers.

For device dimensions down to several dozen nanometers, a detail understandings of the film atomic structures is required. The organic thin films are used as active semiconductor layers in field-effect transistor and light emitting transistor applications. The advantages of organic electronics include low fabrication cost, large area and devices on flexible substrates. In these field effect devices the device performance relies on the orderliness of molecules in few molecular layers at the interface between organic semiconductor and gate insulator, a region of few nanometers in thickness. Our research is to characterize the atomic or molecular structures in these nanometer scale regions of interest, and base on the structural understanding to improve the film formation process towards the desired functional properties. Our primary tool for investigating these nanoscale films is X-rays of various wavelength, generated by the synchrotron accelerator at the Canadian Light Source. We also use the Advanced Photon Source in the States, using the pacific northwest consortium facilities participated by Canadian institutions. Experimentally we use a combined approach including X-ray absorption spectroscopy (extended X-ray absorption fine structure and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure), grazing-incidence X-diffraction and X-ray scattering techniques to probe the nanoscale structures. The metal silicide films are formed by solid state reactions by our collaborators. The organic semiconductor films are fabricated in our laboratories at Guelph using vacuum vapor deposition techniques, assisted with atomic force microscope imaging techniques to ensure the morphological integrity of the samples and photoelectron spectroscopy techniques for their chemical composition integrity.

"With the rapid growth of wireless communications and their applications, the demand for broadband multimedia services will keep increasing in future wireless networks, which will trigger a huge demand for spectral bandwidth. However, most of the related radio spectrum has been assigned to various licensed applications in most regions, thus leading to a potential spectrum scarcity problem. On the other hand, recent real measurements of the spectrum have indicated that at any given location and any given time, much of the licensed spectrum is not utilized. Therefore, dynamic spectrum access has recently emerged as a promising solution to alleviate the spectrum scarcity problem by letting secondary (unlicensed) users borrow the spectrum when the spectrum is temporarily not in use by the primary (licensed) users. As a key enabler for dynamic spectrum access, cognitive radios have received much attention, where secondary users can intelligently adapt to the changing environment. For secondary users, the lower priority to access the spectrum poses a big challenge to the design and analysis of their channel access protocols because primary users should not be affected whenever possible. The situation becomes more complicated when multimedia traffic with heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements is supported.  



The proposed research consists of three components: reliable spectrum sensing, intelligent and optimal spectrum sharing, and wireless interworking (i.e., inter-connection among various wireless networks). It is expected that the proposed research will provide helpful insight into developing a unified network architecture in the future, as the trend of wireless network convergence continues. The research is also of practical significance as the research outcomes (including mathematical models and network algorithms) can help Canadian telecommunications companies develop and deploy low-cost and spectrum-agile wireless networks.

"In this research program, we will study novel discriminative learning algorithms for automatic speech recognition. They are called discriminative learning because they aim to automatically learn the most relevant information from available training data for the purpose of recognition and classification. Our research will focus on how to define a good criterion for learning and how to use effective optimization methods during learning process in the context of large vocabulary speech recognition. We expect our research work will be equally applicable to other pattern classification tasks as well, such as text categorization, optical character recognition, bioinformatics, computer vision and others.

"My proposed research program centers on three topics.

First, I am interested in developing computer-intensive methods to analyze microarray gene expression data. A microarray study typically monitors the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes on a relatively small number of samples. When the data were used to predict for patient classes with respect to a clinical outcome, it was customary to report only a point estimate for prediction error as a measure of prediction accuracy. I will develop new methods to construct confidence intervals for the prediction error, with applications to microarray cancer classification. A confidence interval for prediction error allows health investigators to assess the variability of the prediction accuracy, which is particularly meaningful for small samples.

Second, I am interested in improving the design and analysis of randomized clinical trials when a treatment only benefits a subset of patients (sensitive subset). Treatment effect of this type may be overlooked in traditional clinical trials. Suppose the sensitive subset is determined by unknown gene expression features. In a new design, I will detect treatment effects either through a test on the overall patients (and stop if effective), or through a test on the sensitive subset identified through the gene expression data. The new approach aims to reduce the false rejection rate of clinical trials for testing molecularly targeted treatment.

Finally, I plan to develop resampling methods for the analysis of failure time data with measurement error problems. I will apply the new methods to a practical dataset arising from a breast cancer study comparing the effect of two chemotherapy treatments on patients' survival time. The study measured a genetic factor of the patients with possible errors. The variance estimator is either not derived or has a rather complex expression in the existing analysis methods for such problems. Resampling methods will be practically appealing under these circumstances to avoid involved mathematical derivations.

"Host immune responses are broadly divided into two branches: innate immune response and adaptive immune response. The innate immune response provides the first line defense against microbial infections and also guides the development of an appropriate adaptive response to clear the infection. In the case of immune disorders, inappropriate innate immune activation results in inflammatory responses that overwhelm the host and cause damages to the host. Innate immune activation is mediated by protein receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4.  Molecules capable of interacting with these receptors hold great promise in delivering novel immuno-therapeutics for the treatment of diseases such as septic shock, bacterial infection, and cancers.



In this proposal, we set out to create a group of molecules potentially able to bind to Toll-like receptor 4 and then investigate their biological activities either as immune activating agents or as immune modulating agents. One aspect of this research deals with molecules closely associated with the opportunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is the main cause for the chronic lung infection observed in cystic fibrosis (CF) patents.  The conformational characteristics as well as supramolecular assembly of these molecules will be closely examined.  Such investigation will provide a clearer picture about the structural requirement for their biological activities. Other aspects of this research are directed towards the generation and identification of molecules that display strong immune stimulating activities, or potent inhibitory effect against bacterial endotoxin.  The findings from this interdisciplinary research will lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in pulmonary infection in CF patients, and may as well result in the identification of new chemical structures that show therapeutic potential for treating bacterial infection, cancers, and chronic inflammatory diseases.

"This research addresses the need for effective models, methods and tools that support the development, composition and integration of software systems. There are four activity areas that this research targets:

(1) Integration and interoperability as original design intent. This activity concentrates on specification, design and development as they relate to the integrated system construction process. Building an interoperable system from the ground up presents challenges that are fundamentally different from traditional software system development practices.

(2) Integration and interoperability as an evolutionary necessity. The primary focus of this activity is the analysis of pre-existing systems with the intention of identifying opportunities for co-existence with newly developed or feature-augmented systems. This is an important factor in determining the long-term viability of many legacy information systems.

(3) Assessing the 'composability' of systems. This activity focuses on evaluating the ability of distinct systems to work co-operatively in a 'system-of-systems' context. Examining the opportunities and limitations of system composition provides crucial information to organizations seeking to leverage the effectiveness of current software system assets.

(4) Integrated system maintenance. This activity examines the long term effects of change on interoperable software systems. As integrated systems evolve they become much more difficult to document and maintain. The goal in this activity is to reduce the overall cost of ownership for software assets while continuing to maximize the benefits of the combined services they provide.



In general, the aim is to increase the effectiveness of integration processes and reduce the effort involved in facilitating interoperability among software systems.

"A major concern about the global warming today is its effect on sea level rise and biodiversity change. The study of modern global change in climate and biodiversity is confined to the scale of decade to millennium. Paleontologists investigate environmental and biodiversity changes in Earth history at a million-year scale based on fossil record preserved in sedimentary rocks. During the past 530 million years (myr) of the Phanerozoic Earth history, one of the two grandest episodes of global warming and sea-level rise occurred in Late Ordovician-Early Silurian time (460-430 myr ago), when the North American paleocontinent was flooded by epicontinental seas, in which marine life thrived, with brachiopods being the dominant benthic shelly organisms. In this proposal, the rich brachiopod fossil records of North America will be studied to address several key questions regarding the epicontinental marine shelly faunas: 1) How did the epicontinental brachiopod faunas originate, disperse, and diversify during the global warming and marine transgression? 2) Why did the epicontinental brachiopod faunas become isolated during the Late Ordovician marine transgression but not during the Early Silurian episode? and 3) What environmental and biological factors controlled the differentiation of contemporaneous brachiopod faunas and the temporal fluctuations in biodiversity during the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian? The approach to these questions is to compare the brachiopod faunas between continental-margin seas (e.g. Anticosti Basin, Mackenzie Mountains, Arctic Canada) and inland basins (Hudson Bay, Michigan, and Williston basins), and by tracing the morphological changes in several brachiopod lineages and their paleoecological settings, using cladistic and multivariate analyses. Results from the proposed research can help us better understand modern global change from the perspective of million year-scale global warming and biodiversity change that occurred in ancient Earth history.

"With the increasing demands for wireless networks with high capacity, efficiency, and reliability, combatting signal fading in wireless channels is one of the most fundamental problems in wireless communications. Network cooperative diversity, a recently emerged concept that has drawn considerable attention during the past decade, has been shown to be a promising solution. Its basic idea is to mitigate fading by allowing multiple nodes in the network to help each other's communication tasks. The proposed research is the design and analysis of reliable, self-configuring cooperative networks and practical, adaptive cooperative schemes. More specifically, the applicant focuses on the following aspects. 

         1.) Optimization of cooperative network configurations. This includes the optimizations of relay clustering, relay signal processing functions, and power control.

         2.) Signal processing in multiple-user cooperative networks. This includes finding and analyzing transmitter beamforming schemes, receiver combining and detection schemes, as well as the relay processing that lead to high reliability.

         3.) The impact of practical channel issues. This includes analyzing the effects of training costs and channel errors on existing cooperative schemes and proposing efficient channel training, estimation, and feedback schemes for cooperative networks.

    The proposed research improves the reliability of practical cooperative networks. The outcomes will provide guidance in the design, analysis, and implementation of future wireless networks. The applicant expects new research directions and ideas to be opened up through the program. Aiming at practical, efficient, highly-reliable, and self-configuring, this program would bring us closer to the ultimate goal of wireless communications -- to communicate reliably with anyone anywhere at anytime.

"The correct functioning of biological molecules such as proteins is dependent on molecular properties including structure and stability. My research program is designed to provide a better understanding of the intrinsic properties of biological molecules and of how these properties are influenced by interactions with molecules in the local environment, such as metal ions, other proteins, small ligands and even the ever-present water molecules. The approach we take is to characterize biomolecules and biomolecular complexes in a highly-controlled gas-phase environment. This affords valuable simplification of complex biological systems.  We first characterize intrinsic properties of the biomolecule when it is isolated in the gas phase. Then, we determine the effects of relevant molecular interactions by adding in pieces of the local molecular environment, making such as a small number of water molecules. Our experiments combine the analytically powerful techniques of mass spectrometry with an added dimension of laser spectroscopic data.



The techniques we are developing form a bridge between the vapor and solution-phase regimes. We are investigating why proteins adopt the specific three-dimensional structures, which are critical to their function, by studying both pieces of proteins and whole proteins themselves. This will open a new route to elucidating fundamental information about the forces controlling protein folding and misfolding, which can be the cause many devastating diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's and mad cow disease). This research will also produce new insights into electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and how it can be used effectively in order to gain information about biological systems, significantly increasing the analytical utility of the technique for biological and medical research. One field of potential impact is facilitating drug discovery efforts.

"Gas turbine engines are considered to be amongst the most hostile operating environments for conventional material systems. Increasing demands for higher engine performance, thermal efficiency and durability of components have led to the development of thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems. These systems are typically used on the hot section components of gas turbine engines, such as blades, vanes and combustors for protection against high temperature oxidation and corrosion. TBCs typically consist of an yttria-partially-stabilized zirconia top coat and a MCrAlY (where M can be Ni and/or Co) bond coat usually applied by thermal spray techniques such as plasma and/or HVOF spraying on the superalloy base metal to be protected. The full potential of TBC systems is yet to be reached due to premature failure, usually occurring at the bond coat-top coat interface. Recent studies have shown promising solutions to obtain enhanced performance TBC. In particular, nanocrystalline bond coats have been produced by HVOF. Although these bond coats exhibited partial grain growth compared to the original nanocrystalline feedstock powder, they exhibited improved oxidation and corrosion behaviour, thus enhancing the TBC performances. However, these studies have revealed that the use of HVOF to produce the bond coat promotes the formation of detrimental oxides due to unavoidable in-flight oxidation of the feedstock powder. The production of nanocrystalline bond coat without the formation of harmful oxides and grain growth during spraying is sought as the solution to producing enhanced TBC systems. The long term objective of this research project is to successfully produce enhanced TBC systems that will exhibit better performances with respect to delamination/cracking, by first producing non-oxidized nanocrystalline MCrAlY bond coats using both CGDS and p-CGDS techniques combined with nanocrystalline powder production using existing milling techniques (shorter term objective).It is expected that non-oxidized nanocrystalline bond coats will exhibit superior performances with respect to delamination/cracking.","Materials sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Mechanical Engineering","Jodoin, Bertrand","RGPIN ","Polymers and coatings","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",3-5

"This project focuses on a subset of research activities that needs to be successfully completed in order to reach the overall objective of a five year research program in Reservoir Engineering and Reservoir Characterization. 

The overall vision for the research is to develop a new generation reservoir/well flow simulation tool that will model the well completion and near-wellbore behavior under both steady-state and transient multi-phase flow conditions over the life span of an oil field.  The main purpose of the model is optimal well completion and well trajectory design, based on all available information including information acquired while the well is being drilled. Both analytical and numerical (iterative) approaches will be investigated and tested on realistic field examples. The best candidates for commercial applications will be identified. 

The flow models developed in this research program will be incorporated in commercially available software that will advance the technology to a new level and in new areas not provided by its predecessor's products. In this project the focus will be on the mathematical and numerical determination of flow directions and local refinement of flow disctretizations, particularly in the vicinity of flow restrictions such as packers in advanced well completions. Furthermore, a coupling between a well flow model and a stream line model will be developed.  These are some of the most challenging and important tasks in the entire program since the flow in wells is highly non-linear and flow directions in the wells are directly related to the field reserves and the deliverability of the wells. Drilling and Production Technologies have made enormous progress over the last two decades while flow modeling of advanced wells has been lagging behind.  As optimal well design can only be made by the use of adequate simulation tools, this project will bridge the gap between Drilling/Production and Simulation.  Through this, the Canadian industry in particular as well as the global industry in general will be provided with the tools needed to optimize the well designs with respect to reserves and accelerated production.

"The environment that humans live in is complex, yet our brains must perform visual tasks within a few hundred milliseconds in order for us to survive. How we do this is a fundamental question in psychology. Recent research has shown that our environment has shaped the design of our perceptual systems through evolution and experience. Therefore, direct measurement of the statistical regularities in natural environments (scenes) has great potential value for advancing our understanding of visual perception. My past research has examined the relationships between image statistics, such as colour, brightness and texture within natural scenes. As useful as this research is, it has to be noted that many factors determine what parts of an image we actually choose to look at. Consequently, we can distinguish between the set of all possible statistics, and the set of image statistics that will fall on human retina. My research will investigate human eye movements to isolate the parts of images that are commonly viewed by humans. These parts will then be analyzed using computational models of the brain to determine how (and if) the relationships between colour, luminance and texture statistics are represented within the visual system. I will investigate how the relationships between these image statistics might be used to signal important image structures, such as edges and shapes that are precursors for more complex tasks, such as object and scene recognition. I will also investigate if our visual system is sensitive to variations in scene statistics using psychophysical experiments, and if such variations have negative consequences for performance in visual tasks such as scene recognition. The findings of my research will advance our understanding of how the human visual perception uses the structures and relationships found in natural images, in order to perform everyday vision tasks.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge",Psychology,"Johnson, Aaron","RGPIN ","Sensory systems -- visual",Psychology,Psychologie,1-1
"This proposal comprises studies of the magnetic fields of Mercury, the Moon and Earth, along with studies of Mercury's crust and lithosphere.    These topics provide information on the interior structure and evolution of inner solar system planets and moons.



Investigations of Mercury will use data from NASA's MESSENGER mission, from 3 flybys in 2008 and 2009, and from orbit in 2011-2012. The studies proposed will allow discrimination of crustal and core sources for the magnetic field, and evaluation of proposed core dynamo models. The combined use of topography, gravity, and image data will allow studies of the thickness of Mercury's crust and lithosphere over time, and investigations of the evolution of large impact basins.

Both a core dynamo and impact (shock) processes have been suggested.  Proposed studies aim to understand whether the Moon had a core dynamo and if so when. If shock has played a major role in the acquisition of crustal remanence on the Moon, why is this record so different from at Mars, and what implications does this have for Mercury?



The structure and evolution of Earth's magnetic field is key to understanding the geodynamo and Earth's deep interior, but many aspects of it remain poorly documented. Proposed studies will map the changes in strength and direction of the field over the past 2.5 Myr, by integrating different types of rock magnetic records, and developing global magnetic field models.

"Biogeoscience Institute (BGS) is a University level Institute reporting to the Vice President Research of the University of Calgary.  It consists of two facilities: The Barrier Lake Station (built in 1967 using NRC infrastructure grant) located in the Kananaskis River Valley 80 km west of Calgary, and the R.B. Miller Station (founded in 1950) in the Sheep River Wildlife Sanctuary 120 km southwest of Calgary. Both stations operate year round. BGS also operates two research watersheds. The mandate of BGS is to provide resources for interdisciplinary environmental research and training to universities, government, and the private sector.  The BGS operates the only field stations and research watersheds in the Canadian Rockies. It attracts each year on average 57 independently funded researchers and, in addition, facilitates five interdisciplinary research clusters with 18 principal investigators. The Barrier Lake Station can accommodate about 110 users with access to high service laboratories, growth chambers, boats, computer facilities, walk-in cold rooms, dark room, GIS lab, GPS base station and rover units, library, and herbarium-zoology collections.  There is a main lodge which includes a 26 person dormitory and kitchen/dining facility with full time cook, and a lab/library building with six labs and one lecture room.  A second dormitory and kitchen/dining facility holds 30 persons.  Besides these, there are five duplex units, two houses, one cabin, and three mobile homes available to users.  The R.B. Miller Station consists of a cabin, cookhouse, bunkhouse, laboratory, wash house and one trailer. The facilities can accommodate 20 users and provides electric power and water. BGS averages 16,000 user days per year and was used by 35 universities over the last six years.  There are 16 projects that have lasted over 15 years, 14 projects that have lasted 5-10 years, and 56 projects that have lasted 2-3 years. External use is always greater than that by the University of Calgary. Over the last six years, 56 theses, 319 refereed scientific papers, and three books have resulted from research at BGS and 14,600 students have taken University courses.

"The four proposed research projects bring together ecological and physical (fire and geomorphology) processes in a manner that expands both disciplines.  1) The landscape development-plant tolerance project breaks new ground by using the Channel Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development Model to create a terrain with known climatic, hydrologic, and geomorphic processes and then putting plant communities of different species tolerances (corresponding to real communities) on this terrain's moisture gradients. The approach will help determine the role of different climates and geomorphology on species diversity. 2) Altitudinal treeline is usually narrowly defined by climate (cold); in this project we will examine the geomorphic processes (substrate instability and water shortage caused by slope processes) that also influence treeline. In a time of changing climate these other treeline processes may also change. 3) Wildfires remove the F and H organic layers of the soil by smoldering combustion and allow more successful tree regeneration. In this project we will determine the moisture budgets for the F and H layers-the most important process for smoldering combustion. We intend to create a small watershed (fifth-order stream) distributed model for the moisture budgets that can be used to predict F- and H-layer moisture. 4) Finally, we propose a spatially explicit model of tree mortality from surface fires. This project brings together the Wildlands Fire Dynamics Simulator and the tree mortality model which we have developed to predict tree death under a range of fire intensities. In a time of increased use of low intensity management burns, it is important to understand how heat transfer kills the trees so that the burns can be designed for the desired ecological effect.",Environment,Environment,"Biological Sciences","Johnson, Edward","RGPIN ","Plant ecology","Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",2-5
"Thinking of language acquisition as a process that begins when children utter their first meaningful words overlooks an important stage of language development.  Long before infants are even close to attaching meanings to words or producing grammatical utterances, they must first learn to decode the speech signal.  Research on adult speech perception has demonstrated that decoding the speech signal is a complicated task, requiring a sophisticated understanding of the speech signal. Even identifying word boundaries in speech is challenging because there are no reliable acoustic cues to word boundaries (e.g., silences between words), and no word is produced in an identical fashion twice. Despite these difficulties, infants begin recognizing words remarkably early. Most current models of language acquisition place a heavy burden on infants' ability to extract regularities from their language input. A great number of studies have been reported which support this statistical learning view on early language development, but many of these studies assume an idealized speech input and adult-like attention to the speech signal. But these assumptions are not necessarily justified. In this project, I will address these issues with the goal of better aligning current developmental models of speech perception with the real-life perceptual and cognitive capabilities of normally developing infants. Specific issues that will be addressed include 1) whether infants are more attentive to prosody than adults, 2) whether it is easier for infants to notice mispronunciations in some contexts than others, and 3) whether infants can track statistical patterns in real speech as easily as they do so with the simplified speech used in many laboratory studies.

"Variation in interactions between trophic levels can determine whether productive or consumptive processes dominate community structure (ie, ""bottom-up"" vs. ""top-down"" control), and thus it is imperative that we understand which mechanisms modulate key species interactions and how they operate.  Here I propose to examine the interaction between benthic algae and their invertebrate herbivores in two marine communities that, by the nature of their low diversity, provide a relative simple system in which to address these complex questions.  The general approach is to examine variation in production and consumption along environment gradients to identify where transitions between production-dominated and consumption-dominated conditions occur, and then conduct additional observations and experiments to determine how variation in abiotic factors can shift the balance toward one community state or the other.  This approach will first be developed in an intertidal system where filamentous green algae can form extensive algal mats when not controlled by herbivorous snails, and then extended to a subtidal community where consumption by urchins can create barren grounds that lack conspicuous kelp.  In both systems we will focus on how variability in contrasting abiotic factors (nutrients and water motion) can permit early vulnerable stages to escape control by consumers.  The results will not only contribute to general ecological theory, but will be critical for understanding the functioning of coastal ecosystems as well as addressing applied problems (eg, eutrophication).

"The central theme of my research program is to evaluate the impacts of land use change on interactions between the water cycle and biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen. I am applying the methods I developed for real-time dissolved CO2 measurement in streams and groundwater to watersheds in British Columbia. I am integrating these CO2 field measurements with additional environmental sensors in soils and streams. These measurements will be used to develop numerical models that will improve our understanding of integrated watershed behaviour and stream water quality. 

     Effluxes of CO2 and methane from surface water to the atmosphere are increasingly recognized as fundamental to the resolution of gaps in the terrestrial C balance. However, little research to date has measured the influence of land use change on aquatic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) including CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. This information is essential for sustainability assessments of resource management strategies. 

     Land use change can lead to increased formation of methane and nitrous oxide in soil, groundwater and surface water. Detailed field-based characterizations of hydrologic flowpaths and biogeochemical fluxes in dissolved, particulate and gaseous forms will be conducted in perturbed and reference watersheds. This will allow for basic and applied research questions to be evaluated in a range of environments and at key environmental interfaces including the root-soil interface of the rhizosphere, the vadose zone-saturated zone interface within soils, and the terrestrial-aquatic interface in headwater catchments. 

     Overall, I seek to open new avenues for research and land management by identifying biogeochemical hotspots as well as opportunities to minimize land use related effluxes of GHG from aquatic systems. This research will advance my field by contributing key information on carbon sequestration and GHG emissions related to land use practices. This will help Canada to become a leader in carbon sequestration determination and full-cost accounting of GHG emissions from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

"Throughout the world, 91% of our primary energy is derived from combustion processes and indications suggest this fraction is likely to remain stable if not increase over the next 25 years.  Within the context of global climate change, energy security, and air quality and health, it is critical that we develop ways to optimize the efficiency of combustion systems while mitigating associated emissions.  The main objectives of this proposal are to further fundamental understanding of stabilization, propagation, and pollutant emissions of pre-mixed and non-premixed turbulent flames.  Specifically, we aim to study:

   1) ultra-lean premixed flame stabilization and propagation using swirl burners and pulsating flames;

   2) propagation of turbulent partially premixed flames in the presence of composition gradients; and

   3) soot formation within turbulent diffusion flames.

This work will continue to provide a critical basis for more applied research on quantifying and modeling pollutant emissions.  Previous work on swirl-stabilized flames has already led to technology developments for gas turbines and experiments outlined in this proposal are designed to further this impact.  Planned experiments using planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging on partially premixed flames has fundamental relevance to promising applications in stratified charge automobile engine design.  Finally, the planned work on soot formation in turbulent diffusion flames has direct application to flaring in the energy industry where approximately 160 billion m3 of gas were flared globally in 2006.  The proposed research is designed to improve fundamental understanding of basic combustion processes that are critical to efficient energy conversion and mitigation of environmental impacts.

"CD44 is a cell adhesion molecule expressed on many cells in your body, but we are interested in its function on white blood cells.  These are cells of the immune system and we are particularly interested in the function of CD44 on T cells, the cells that control immune responses.  CD44 is a molecule that has been implicated in helping white blood cells get to the site of infection, in resolving an inflammatory response, in wound healing and in the migration of tumor cells that results in metastasis.  It is our hypothesis that the function of this molecule in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions is to interact with its ligand, then signal to the cell to either stay or go. We are interested in determining how the interaction of CD44 with its ligand affects T cell adhesion and migration and how CD44 signals to the cytoskeletal machinery to mediate these effects.  We intend to identify the molecular signals responsible for transmitting the signal from CD44 to the cell cytoskeleton. We have already initiated this process and have found an enzyme that is associated with CD44 inside the cell. We are now looking for substrates of this enzyme, to follow the signaling pathway downstream. This is being done using immunochemistry and biochemical techniques. In addition, we will determine how the interaction of CD44 with its ligand modifies T cell adhesion or migration and will identify the molecular basis for this modulation. By understanding the signals that regulate cell adhesion and migration we will better understand how the immune system functions and is regulated. We depend on these cells to be at the right place at the right time to effectively protect us against disease. This basic research into what makes a cell stop and what makes a cell go is of fundamental importance in cell biology.  Understanding at the molecular level what regulates immune cell adhesion and migration is an important step towards the future development of new biotechnologies designed to facilitate, mimic or prevent cell movement or cell adhesion.  By investing in this basic research, Canadians are ensuring the continuation of scientific discovery and progress for future generations.

"The goal of our research program is to advance the body of knowledge and understanding of integration of function of the peripheral venous system. In order for the cardiovascular system to meet the changing demands of the body, moment-to-moment adjustments in regulation of  vascular function are required to maintain balance between the venous and arterial systems.  This fact underscores the requirement for complex differences in the regulation of function of the low pressure venous system compared to the high pressure arterial system.  Although is is widely accepted that the venous system is critical to the normal functioning of the cardiovascular system, surprisingly less is know about regulation of peripheral venous function compared to the arteries. The applicant and others have demonstrated the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in regulation of peripheral venous function, however, other major factors are important in regulating vessels, including local and circulating factors and the inherent properties of the vessels themselves.  We will study how the peripheral sympathetic nervous system affects the veins and arteries of a large vascular bed, the mesentery, under physiologic conditions of changing pressure in the vessels. We propose studies that will identify the neurotransmitters (chemicals) released by the sympathetic nerves to cause contractions in the mesenteric veins and arteries under conditions of changing pressure in the vessels.  We will also identify differences in the mechanisms by which veins contract compared to arteries, including interactions between neurotransmitters and the inherent properties of the vessels.  The results of these studies will allow our lab to begin to understand how the sympathetic nervous system and local and circulating factors interact with the cells of the systemic veins to yield a highly integrated environment, an how differences in regulation of local venous and arterial function enable balance between the veins and arteries to be maintained in the mammalian circulation.

"We now know that the human brain continues to develop throughout childhood and into early adulthood. However, there is still much to be learned about the developmental course of cognitive abilities. In recent years there have been innovative applications of mathematical models to understand how the adult mind processes certain types of information. For example, these techniques have shown that under conditions where a decision or a response can be made with only a limited amount of information, we typically do not process the extra information. We also tend to process multiple pieces of information at the same time, or in parallel, rather than one piece of information at a time (e.g., serially). Research has also demonstrated that there are situations that require all pieces of information to make an accurate decision and conditions where serial processing is necessary. In general, this work suggests that the approach an adult employs at any given time conforms to the constraints of the task at hand, and in many cases, appears to be the most efficient strategy. 



My research will apply these mathematical approaches to studies of children and adolescents in order to gain a better understanding of how cognitive abilities develop. There is evidence to suggest that children's approaches to a variety of cognitive tasks is less efficient than those used by adults. I am interested in determining if children process information in a qualitatively different manner than adults. Importantly, I will follow children across time so that we can learn how their approaches change as they develop and at what point they perform in a manner that is consistent with adults. This work will provide important information about the path and timeline of cognitive development. Findings will be critical for establishing an understanding of typical development so that we will then have an appropriate comparison for atypical development (e.g., autism, learning disabilities). Furthermore, improved models of cognitive development will be important for improving our models of brain development.

"The MicroScribe MX 3D Digitizer requested in this application will extend the research capabilities of the Colleges of Engineering, Medicine and Kinesiology at the University of Saskatchewan in the areas of imaging, biomechanics, tissue mechanics and tissue engineering. One central goal of multidisciplinary musculoskeletal research conducted at the University of Saskatchewan involves assessing bone and cartilage strength with non-invasive imaging tools. These imaging tools include the Canadian Light Source Synchrotron, micro computed tomography (microCT), peripheral Quantitative CT (pQCT), high resolution pQCT, clinical CT and clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Imaging techniques have been recently developed to estimate mechanical properties of bone and cartilage. However, it is currently not known how well these imaging techniques estimate mechanical properties. Further, without accurate strength estimations we cannot reliably trust results from computer models--specifically finite element (FE) models--of bone and cartilage. The applied MicroScribe MX digitizer will enable us to accurately compare imaged-derived and experimentally-derived mechanical properties, and thus confirm imaged strength estimates using available imaging tools at the University of Saskatchewan. Using reverse engineering techniques, the MicroScribe MX will also enable us to re-create bone and spinal cord tissues as computer models to aid in the design and fabrication of tissue repairing structures such as scaffolds. The key features of this equipment include: high accuracy, low cost, and portability for use with various imaging tools and permanent instruments located throughout the University of Saskatchewan. This device will support the training of students in a multidisciplinary area involving mechanical and biomedical engineering, kinesiology, and medicine. The MicroScribe MX will help us to: (1) reliably estimate bone and cartilage strength; (2) build computer models that can be used to better understand bone and joint diseases; (3) develop low radiation-dose assessments of bone strength using the Canadian Light Source synchrotron; and (4) build artificial structures (scaffolds) for bone and spinal cord repair.

"The surface of cells is comprised of a lipid membrane that provides the structural integrity of the cell and functions as an interface between the cell and its environment.  The physical organization of lipids and proteins in cellular membranes plays a key role in controlling many biological processes.  For example, membranes are believed to contain small areas known as rafts that have large amounts of cholesterol and other components and that are important in organizing proteins and initiating signaling pathways.  We develop and apply spectroscopic and imaging tools that can be used to understand the details of how lipids and proteins are organized in model and natural membranes and how the overall organization contributes to controlling biological function.  The tools that we use are a combination of scanning probe microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy.  These tools allow one to map the topography of the surface and to identify specific components based on their characteristic fluorescence.  We are specifically interesting in using high resolution imaging methods to understand the formation of rafts in membranes.  Our studies are carried out in artificial membranes comprised of supported lipid bilayers and in cells.  This research will contribute to a detailed understanding of  processes occurring at cell surfaces.  This has important implications for understanding both normal and abnormal functions of membrane proteins which are the targets for over half of currently marketed drugs.  The work may also contribute to approaches for designing biosensors and will provide students with training in multidisciplinary research projects at the interface between chemistry, biology and physics.

"All living organisms exist under the constant threat of mutation. The rate at which mutations arise and their fitness effects are two of the most important quantities in evolution. The majority of mutations are believed to be deleterious, and many common features of life have probably evolved at least in part as a response to deleterious mutations. These features include diploidy, outcrossing and sexual reproduction and recombination. Despite the commonness of fitness-reducing mutations, some mutations must be beneficial, and these supply the raw material for adaptive evolution. The proposed research investigates three aspects of the evolutionary biology of mutations. In the first, we will explore the causes of sperm-biased mutation transmission in plants, a phenomenon recently discovered in our lab. Male-biased mutation had been documented in mammals and birds, where it was proposed to result largely from the greater number of cell divisions in the male than in the female germ line. This cell-division hypothesis should not apply to plants, so the discovery in plants shows that other causal processes must be operating. The second major thrust of the proposed research will study the mutation rate and the advantages of sex and recombination using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The rate of mutation and the spectrum of fitness effects are two of the most important yet unresolved issues in evolutionary biology. The third major part of the proposed research investigates the maintenance of genetic variation in plant populations differing in rate of self-fertilization. Using both molecular and quantitative genetic measures, we will quantify the degree to which self-fertilization causes a change in genetic variation, and thus may contribute to the apparent lack of persistence of highly self-fertilizing lineages over evolutionary time.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Biology,"Johnston, Mark","RGPIN ","Evolution and ecology","Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",3-5

"Plate tectonics provides an explanation for mountain systems: the collision of continents along a convergent margin. The Himalayan-Alpine chain stems from the attempted subduction of Africa, in the west, and India, in the east, beneath Europe-Asia. Explaining the Rocky Mountains of the Canadian Cordillera, is more difficult. Deformation occurred 80 to 50 million years ago. But ancient North American continental crust extends west to the coast, and there was no collision at 80 Ma. Hence the Rocky Mountains are thought to have formed 2000 kms inboard of a plate margin, and in the absence of a continental collision. The Cordilleran crust sits beneath thrust sheets of oceanic character. Accretion of these ""terranes"" was thought to explain the Rockies. However, terrane accretion ended by 200 Ma, >100 Ma before the Rockies formed. How do you explain an 80 Ma mountain belt as the result of a 200 Ma collision?

An assumption of the accretionary model is that the Cordilleran lower crust and mantle is North American. An alternative view is that the crust west of the Rockies is exotic and that the Rockies result from a two stage process: (a) accretionary construction of an exotic composite ribbon continent, followed by (b) transpressional collision with North America. A requirement of this model is the presence of a cryptic suture within the foreland. Demonstrating the presence (or absence) of a cryptic suture is a major test of the collisional model. My proposal is for a program of geological, paleomagnetic, seismic reflection, geochronological and geochemical studies focused along transects across the inferred cryptic suture.  The transects cross that domain bound by an east-facing Paleozoic platform to the west, and by the shallow water limestones of the classic Rocky Mountains to the east; and which is characterized by alkali intrusions that may mark the suture.  The ultimate goals of this research program are to test constrasting models of orogeny (accretionary vs. collisional), and to reconcile geological and geophysical data sets in models of orogenesis.

My research will focus on the particular reproductive traits of offspring quantity and quality, and my study organisms will be the freshwater fishes inhabiting the boreal shield region of Canada.  In fishes, the probability that offspring will survive through early life is largely determined by the size and composition of egg produced by their mothers.  My objective is to quantify variation in egg quantity and quality in these wild fishes, and test predictions from current theory on how environmental forces are shaping these traits.  This objective will be met through a series of field- and laboratory-based research projects carried out by graduate and undergraduate students under my supervision.  The results of this research will further our understanding of the mechanisms driving egg quality variation, and of the evolution of life history characteristics in general.  The results will also prove beneficial to fisheries management and aquaculture.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Biology,"Johnston, Thomas","RGPIN ","Animal ecology","Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",2-5

"The global climate is changing. At the same time, humans are dramatically altering patterns of land surface cover, changing disturbance regimes, and introducing new species. Combined effects of climate change and human activities mean that most ecosystems have entered a period of rapid directional change in environmental conditions that has no historical analogue. How should we expect ecological systems to respond to this rapid change? 

     Boreal forests are the earth's third largest terrestrial biome and comprise about 90% of Canada's forest land cover. These forests may be particularly vulnerable to climate change, as many physical processes and organisms in the North are sensitive to temperature, and climate changes are predicted to occur first and fastest at high latitudes. Climate change is also likely to stimulate increases in the extent of forest fires and insect outbreaks, which combined with human activities, could lead to much greater rates of forest disturbance. How will changes in disturbance interact with ongoing climate change to drive future changes in Canada's boreal forests? 

     This question is the focus of the proposed research, which uses field observations and experiments to examine the effects of local climate and disturbance on vegetation in the boreal forest. Research in Yukon Territory will range from experiments on the effects of drought-stress on forest regeneration after fire in dry boreal forests, to examining the role of disturbance in opening avenues for invading species at the northern treeline. The research addresses three types of interactions between climate change and disturbance and their potential effects on boreal forest ecosystems: a) the role of disturbance in regulating patterns of plant species migration, b) impacts of changes in disturbance type and severity on forest recovery, and c) direct effects of climate warming on forest regeneration. Studies on these themes will provide new information on how disturbance may act as a catalyst of boreal forest responses to future climate change.

"Design, Testing and Modeling of Polymer Systems as Alternatives to PVC in Flooring-Products



Polyvinylchloride, commonly known as PVC, is a remarkable type of polymer which finds a wide variety of industrial applications in composite materials used, for example, in construction and transportation. However, the high chlorine content of PVC, and the plasticizers used to facilitate its processing, create potential health hazards which are currently driving the search for alternative polymer systems. The proposed project aims to develop new chlorine-free and plasticizer-free polymers for application in flooring products, such as floor tiles. To achieve this goal, the project draws from a combination of academic expertise (Universit� de Sherbrooke) and industrial know-how (American Biltrite). These groups have already initiated joint prospection research and polymer blending approaches which identified several potentially valuable substitutes for PVC. The project described here will perform systematic experimental and theoretical work on polymer systems incorporating polymers referred to as 'ionomers', in order to guide the selection and optimization of suitable PVC substitutes in flooring product application. The successful completion of this project will contribute substantial benefits to a Canadian-based company, while eliminating health hazards related to exposure to PVC.

"Many car and truck frame components are conventionally formed by hydroforming in large presses. If the

operation must be carried out at elevated temperatures, then hot gases can be used instead of water. The latter

method is particularly applicable to Mg alloys, which have very limited formabilities at room temperature.

(Mg is the lightest structural metal and is therefore of interest with respect to reducing vehicle weight and fuel

consumption.) The ductility of Mg at elevated temperatures is controlled in part by its crystallographic texture,

that is the ensemble of orientations adopted by the individual crystals making up the component in question.

The texture of such a tube is established during the previous extrusion operation, which is carried out at various

temperatures and speeds, on various alloys, and using a range of geometric parameters. The aim of this

investigation is to optimize all the parameters of the alloys selected and of the extrusion process so as to

produce tubes that are more readily manufactured by hot gas forming.","Fabricated metal products","Manufacturing processes and products","Mining & Materials Engineering.","Jonas, John","CRDPJ ","Materials processing","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",2-3

"My research program will focus on (1) hot spring/geyser deposits, (2) the evolution of Tertiary dolostones of the Cayman Islands, and (3) development of Devonian reefs in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB).

Hot Spring/Geyser Deposits: Based on data collected from hot springs and geysers on Iceland, New Zealand, the Kenyan Rift Valley, and western Canada this research will determine the factors that control the precipitation of calcite and/or aragonite crystals and silica in these systems. Emphasis will be placed on the role that microbes (e.g., bacteria, cyanobacteria, fungi) play in the formation of these deposits as well as their preservation.  This carries major implications for microbe preservation in rocks of all ages. 

Evolution of Tertiary dolostones of the Cayman Islands: This research will focus on the origin of the dolostones that form most of the Bluff Group (Oligocene - Pliocene in age) with the view of explaining how pervasively dolomitized successions originate under the low temperature and low pressure regimes near the surface of the earth. The latter study has important implications for the origin of dolostones of all ages and, in particular, the manner in which they evolve to become excellent hydrocarbon reservoirs.

Devonian reefs in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin: Based on the area to the south and west of Great Slave Lake, this research examines the factors that controlled growth and development of Devonian reefs and associated sediments. Reefs like these, located to the south, commonly contain vast reserves of oil and/or gas. This research will determine the factors that controlled the development of these reservoirs.

"Massive stars have effects on their surroundings by providing energy via their radiation fields, winds, and by supernova explosions, and they supply heavy elements, the building blocks of planetary systems. My research focuses on particular types of massive stars surrounded by disk-like distributions of material in order to understand how these disks form, and the effects these systems have on their surroundings. These investigations include young stars that have disks formed from material left over from birth, and on more evolved stars that have disks formed from material released from the star itself.



Specifically, I construct computer models of these disk-star systems. My models predict particular details in the light, such as spectral energy distributions and spectral line profiles, that come from these objects, and then these predictions are compared with actual observations. These comparisons allow me to decipher the physical conditions surrounding these stars, such as temperature, density, geometry, and wind speed, so that I can try to understand what processes form and maintain these disk-like regions. My models allow observations of these systems from international observatories, such as the US Naval optical interferometer in Arizona, European Southern Observatory's infrared interferometer, and NASA's ultraviolet orbiting satellite to be interpreted correctly.  This research allows the true physical conditions in these disks to be determined, and will ultimately lead to the development of realistic dynamical models for these systems.

"How much work for a duck to dive?  Work of diving is obtained by calculating the distance the body is moved.  When ducks dive to the bottom of a pond they spend half the dive time pecking away in a stationary position.  No body movement so no work done, yet why do ducks look like they are working so hard to hold their position?  We will measure the work done by the feet in moving water, not the body, using high speed cine-photography to obtain 3D views of the feet.  This research will revolutionise our understanding of the eco-physiology of foot-propelled birds as we will have a ""real"" value for the work of diving.  

The reptiles provide a plausible view of the morphological progression between the trabeculate amphibian single ventricle and the divided avian heart.  Turtles were the stem group but the advent of molecular phylogenies have placed squamates (scaled reptiles) at the stem.  Turtles are now more closely related to crocodiles or snakes, the former having a divided ventricle and the latter one with three, inter-connecting chambers.  This new view calls for a re-interpretation of both the morphology and function of the turtle heart, not only by classical anatomical and physiological techniques but also by investigations of the living heart by trans-oesophageal ultrasound and MRI, using 3T & 7T magnets. 

There are more misunderstandings about regulation of blood flow in the face of gravitational forces than any other aspect of blood flow dynamics.  The arteries and veins in the neck are full of blood and these static columns of blood, held up against gravity, reduce pressure in the cranial vessels so that veins collapse shutting down blood flow to the brain. We will use unrestrained emus to study the effects of gravity on arterial blood pressure so that, for the first time, a behavioural component can be incorporated in the study.  Emus only hold their head at maximum height above the heart during aggressive manoeuvres when arterial blood pressure will be elevated.  So, behaviour could be an important component in keeping blood vessels open-if the cranial vessels collapse then why not just put your head down!","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Zoology,"Jones, David","RGPIN ","Animal circulation","Animal biology","Biologie animale",1-1

"Modern science relies more and more extensively on the utilization of technologically advanced forms of spectroscopy. In fields as diverse as medicine, biology, physics, chemistry, and material science, there is a constant effort to develop novel spectroscopic tools and techniques as they play a fundamental role in the generation of new intuition, concepts, and understandings. Specifically, spectroscopic investigations of materials enable the knowledge of (and ultimately the control over) microscopic, nanoscopic and even quantum characteristics that in turn directly influence macroscopic physical properties.



A critical component in spectroscopic studies is the laser source and in many cases, present experiments are limited by the available laser technology. Very recently, the fields of high precision spectroscopy and ultrafast optical science have cooperated in an extremely profitable synergy to develop an entirely new set of laser technologies. This union has led to the development of stabilized short-pulse lasers (known as optical frequency combs), initiating a revolution in optical frequency metrology. A truly groundbreaking advance, it was explicitly cited by the Nobel committee in awarding the 2005 Nobel Prize for Physics to Dr. John Hall (one of my postdoctoral advisors) only five short years after its demonstration.



In this proposed research, I will continue to develop this new laser technology and apply it to innovative spectroscopic applications with potentially far-reaching outcomes. In one application we will use it to form ultracold molecules from laser-cooled atoms and study their interactions at low temperatures. In a second effort instrumentation to enable real-time, in-situ measurements of nanoaerosols will be developed. With this ability, several applications become possible ranging from using precisely scaled nanoparticles as vehicles for targeted delivery of pharmaceutical agents to evaluation of combustion processes for minimal soot production.

"The terrestrial biosphere plays an important role in determining the composition of the atmosphere; and changes in atmospheric composition, in turn, can significantly impact the biosphere. Reliably predicting global climate change due to changing atmospheric abundances of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and ozone (O3), will require an improved understanding of this coupling between the biosphere and the atmosphere. The proposed research program will use a coupled biosphere-atmosphere model together with advanced data assimilation techniques to exploit newly available satellite observations and surface measurements of environmentally important trace gases to better quantify the influence of the biosphere on the composition of the troposphere. In particular, the work will develop a multi-species biosphere-atmosphere data assimilation system based on a four-dimensional variational data assimilation approach, which exploits satellite observations of atmospheric gases such CO2, CH4, and O3 to optimize the parameters that govern key ecosystem processes in the biospheric model. There has been significant effort in the land-surface modelling community using satellite observations in a data assimilation context to better model biospheric processes. Similarly, there is increasing focus in the atmospheric chemistry modelling community on exploiting the growing wealth of space-based observations of environmentally important tracer gases to better understand the global distribution of these gases. The proposed research program will link the on-going work in these communities to obtain an improved understanding of the contribution of the biosphere to the changing composition of the troposphere.","Climate and atmosphere",Environment,Physics,"Jones, Dylan","RGPIN ","Atmospheric science","Atmospheric science","�tude de l'atmosph�re",1-5

"A set of microsensors is requested to make physiology measurements on the micron scale in engineering and whole tissues. Cells and tissues are exceedingly sensitive to their microenvironment and the measurement of bulk properties often does not represent the local conditions that affect a cell or tissue. It is therefore essential that we develop a better understanding of the spatial gradients that are present in order to understand the effect cell growth and health.



The requested set of probes include; a pressure transducer (5 �m sensor), a PV catheter (600 �m sensor), a pH meter (100 �m sensor), a pO2 microsensor (50 �m sensor), a NO microsensor (30 �m sensor) and a microviscometer (10 �L sample volume). This set of measurement probes cover the range of important measurements in cellular and tissue physiology and will therefore allow McGill researchers complete access to the microenvironment of a cell or tissue.  Their small size will allow the co-applicants to measure these parameters both with high spatial resolution and in small sample sizes.



The applications of these instruments are diverse, thereby supporting the research of at least 5 professors in the university involved in biomedical engineering.  Because of the high spatial resolution of these microsensors, they can be used to measure physiological profile within scaffolds for tissue engineering.  The probes are capable of making measuring important cardiovascular parameters in small vessels, such as those of the microcirculation or in the vessels of small experimental animals (such as mouse).  Furthermore, many of the probes will allow single cell measurements applicable to areas such as nanomedicine and microfluidic devices. This requested equipment is at the cutting edge of instrumentation. Between th 5 professors, over 15 students will have access to this state of the art equipment and use it in their research.  These probes are the smallest available for physiological measurement and will allow us to measure parameters that have not been accessible in the past.

"The cardiovascular system is the first functional organ in the embryo, and proper functioning of the early cardiovascular system is essential for embryonic health and survival. The blood vessels of the embryo are initially established by a process called vasculogenesis which occurs in the absence of blood flow.  These early vessels are then remodeled through a secondary process that is known to be dependent on the presence of blood flow. In recent years, there has been a debate regarding which aspects of early vascular formation are genetically predetermined, and which are governed by external stimuli, such as mechanical and biochemical signaling.   Though the initial vascular network is patterned without physiological feedback, once flow has begun, a separate set of physical and metabolic signals arise.  Blood pressure, blood flow, and related physical forces such as circumferential wall stress and wall shear stress as well as metabolic information such as nutrient and oxygen requirements all can provide feedback to genetically encoded signaling mechanisms. The point at which the switch from genetic mechanisms to physiological feedback mechanisms occurs remains largely unexplored.  



I propose using combination of high-speed microscopy, flow visualization techniques such as DPIV and computational modelling to further investigate the relative role of genetic predetermination and hemodynamics in early cardiovascular development.  By applying these methods to the embryonic microvasculature, I will be able to investigate questions about early vascular developments such as when the early vasculature begins to receive patterning cues from blood flow, rather than from genetics.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","Chemical Engineering","Jones, Elizabeth","RGPIN ",Biomechanics,"Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",3-5

"My research focuses on the biology of seabirds - those birds that come to land only to breed and otherwise remain offshore. Seabirds live a long time, have long-term monogamous pair bonds, and usually nest in colonies, making them an ideal subject for biological studies concerned about mate choice and how populations are naturally (and un-naturally) regulated.  My previous work confirmed a link between climate variability and survival at one island during 1990-2007.  My proposed study aims to expand this with work on four bird species at four remote Pacific Islands during 2008-2012.  Survival estimates, relationships between survival and climate, and inter-island differences in survival will be evaluated.  The results will have profound implications for our understanding of links between seabirds, biological processes in the ocean, and climate.  We are also investigating sexual selection (the evolutionary force related to mating that explains colourful, bizarre and often costly adornments displayed) and monogamy and how these relate to populations.  Unraveling the evolutionary mechanisms of sexual selection has provided one of the most controversial and interesting problems in biology.  Our previous research showed the first evidence for mutual sexual selection and for mating preferences by one bird species for adornments naturally occurring in another species, showed ornaments being favoured by mate choice and simultaneously acting as signals of dominance, and revealed  an ornament with a secondary sensory (touch) function.  My proposed future research will address questions about the function of elaborate ornaments and displays and population consequences of sexual selection.  Our group will be looking at how adornments and preferences change as individuals age, how this affects lifetime reproductive success and whether both preferences and adornments vary among isolated populations.  Altogether, our work will demonstrate how varying climate and predation, combined with sexually-selected reproductive decisions, all determine population change.  Taken together, the results will contribute to a better understanding of seabird biology with broad implications for conservation and management of marine wildlife.

"The ability to communicate complex thoughts and emotions with speech is uniquely human. As well, it is commonly assumed that the human voice was the first musical instrument. The core skill required for both speaking and singing is the precise coordination of the vocal articulators (larynx, tongue, jaw, and lips). Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that hearing your own voice is important for vocal control. For example, people who lose their hearing after they have learned to talk show a gradual deterioration in the quality of their speech.  Problems related to intensity, pitch control and speech rate are frequently seen soon after hearing loss. However, it is only after much longer periods of deafness that problems in vowel and consonant production appear. When hearing impaired individuals can again hear their own speech with the help of technologies such as hearing aids or cochlear implants, the quality of their speech typically returns to normal. This observation that some aspects of speech are immediately affected by deafness while others persist unaltered for a relatively long time after deafness onset shows that some features of speech production rely on auditory feedback, while others rely on a neural representation that allows the brain to predict what sound will result from a particular vocal tract movement. The goal of my research program is to understand how the brain forms and uses these representations of the acoustic-motor relationship for speech. To uncover the neural mechanisms involved, I will use functional magnetic resonance imaging and event-related potential experiments to advance our basic understanding of the sensorimotor mappings that are critical to vocalization. Several communication disorders are thought to be linked to a failure in the mechanisms that relate motor control and sensory feedback. Understanding the sensorimotor representations supporting speech will aid the development of treatments for these forms of communication disorders. In addition, the research may help clarify the impact of hearing impairments on the development of speech in children and the preservation of intelligible speech in adults, as well as be relevant to research on second-language learning.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge",Psychology,"Jones, Jeffery","RGPIN ","Motor systems and performance",Psychology,Psychologie,1-5

"As many as 15,000 species of fungi form symbiotic associations called ectomycorrhizas with roots of woody plants.  One reason that there are so many ectomycorrhizal fungi may be because they fill specific niches in the soil.   New methods in molecular biology have demonstrated that the hyphae of different ectomycorrhizal fungi are indeed found in different soil horizons or microsites.  In addition, the extramatrical hyphae (those that extend well beyond the root) may be located in a different part of the soil profile from roots colonized by that fungus.  However we know almost nothing about how the physiologies of these fungi relate to distribution amongst microsites.  My research group uses several approaches to study the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in nutrient uptake and nutrient cycling in the field.  It is important to study ectomycorrhizal physiology in situ, where possible, so that bacteria associated with hyphae are native ones, and so that the extensive network of hyphae  formed by these associations can remain intact.   We will use a root window-based imprinting technique to identify mm-scale 'hot spots' of extracellular enzyme activity.  These enzymes are involved in organic matter breakdown. Using the imprints as a guide, we will collect very small soil samples, from which we will amplify fungal DNA.  We will then determine whether fungal communities in the hot spots differed from those in microsites with low enzyme activities.  At some sites, we will test whether ectomycorrhizal fungi that are more common in decayed wood are more likely to secrete enzymes that break down lignin and cellulose found in wood.  We will do this both by measuring the activities directly, as well as by detecting soil mRNA for these enzymes. We will also use stable isotopes of nitrogen as tracers to determine whether fungi that dominate clearcut communities differ in their ability to absorb organic N from fungi found in forests with well-developed forest floors. Much of the variation in soil microbial communities is ""still viewed as random noise"". Our research will help to determine whether physiological differences amongst ectomycorrhizal fungi is one of the factors that influences their distribution.

"Due to the massive, climate-induced outbreak of the Mountain and Western Pine Beetles, the pine forests on which much of the forest industry in interior BC is based will largely disappear by 2013. This will devastate the economies of many forestry-supported towns and cities. As an intervention strategy to increase timber supply, the BC Ministry of Forests and Range has proposed widespread use of fertilization to accelerate the development of already-existing stands. Given that 17,000 ha were operationally fertilized in BC last year, and that a further 9 million ha have already been killed by pine beetles, the potential area for fertilization is extremely large. Earlier research in Europe, the NE USA, and Alaska has demonstrated that addition of high levels of nitrogen to forests can reduce root growth, disrupt microbially-driven nutrient cycles, and increase leaching, but that effects vary by ecosystem and are not predicted by current theory. Our study would make use. of an existing long-term fertilization experiment in interior pine and spruce forests to test whether belowground microbial communities and the ecosystem services they provide are disrupted by stand-level fertilization. We  | will use cutting-edge approaches to determine the effect of fertilization on (i) nutrient supply rates of N, P, K, S, and B and (ii) chemical composition of litter and soil organic matter. We will then use biochemical, isotopic, and molecular methods to determine whether the microbial community has 'adapted' to these new conditions or whether the ability of soil bacteria and fungi to cycle the altered nutrients has been compromised. This will be the first time in Canada that fertilizer-induced changes in the chemistry of soil organic matter will be linked to corresponding changes in nutrient cycling in forest soils. The results will allow forest licensees and government regulators to identify fertilizer regimes that allow the best combination of growth enhancement and ecosystem resilience.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Okanagan - Irving K Barber School of Arts and Sciences","Jones, Melanie","STPGP ","Biology and microbiology","Soil science","Science du sol",3-3
"As many as 15,000 species of fungi form symbiotic associations called ectomycorrhizas with roots of woody plants.  One reason that there are so many ectomycorrhizal fungi may be because they fill specific niches in the soil.   New methods in molecular biology have demonstrated that the hyphae of different ectomycorrhizal fungi are indeed found in different soil horizons or microsites.  In addition, the extramatrical hyphae (those that extend well beyond the root) may be located in a different part of the soil profile from roots colonized by that fungus.  However we know almost nothing about how the physiologies of these fungi relate to distribution amongst microsites.  My research group uses several approaches to study the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in nutrient uptake and nutrient cycling in the field.  It is important to study ectomycorrhizal physiology in situ, where possible, so that bacteria associated with hyphae are native ones, and so that the extensive network of hyphae  formed by these associations can remain intact.   We will use a root window-based imprinting technique to identify mm-scale 'hot spots' of extracellular enzyme activity.  These enzymes are involved in organic matter breakdown. Using the imprints as a guide, we will collect very small soil samples, from which we will amplify fungal DNA.  We will then determine whether fungal communities in the hot spots differed from those in microsites with low enzyme activities.  At some sites, we will test whether ectomycorrhizal fungi that are more common in decayed wood are more likely to secrete enzymes that break down lignin and cellulose found in wood.  We will do this both by measuring the activities directly, as well as by detecting soil mRNA for these enzymes. We will also use stable isotopes of nitrogen as tracers to determine whether fungi that dominate clearcut communities differ in their ability to absorb organic N from fungi found in forests with well-developed forest floors. Much of the variation in soil microbial communities is ""still viewed as random noise"". Our research will help to determine whether physiological differences amongst ectomycorrhizal fungi is one of the factors that influences their distribution.

"Just as a person's hands are mirror images of one another, many molecules are also ""handed,"" or chiral. Chiral molecules are important because they are the building blocks of much of biology (e.g., DNA, proteins and sugars) and many interactions, such as those between drugs and their specific targets in the body, depend upon discriminating recognition events between chiral components: only one ""hand"" of a chiral molecule is recognised, while the other is rejected. Our research takes an integrated approach to the development of fundamentally new catalysts for the selective production of single ""hands"" of chiral molecules.



Towards this goal, part of the proposed research examines the basic reactivity of the element phosphorus as seen through the eyes of a trained heavy metal chemist. It seeks to discover emergent properties that result from combining two very different portions of the periodic table in new ways. These combinations will give rise to remarkable behaviour arising from cooperative effects that neither the non-metallic nor metallic component alone could elicit. In this way, new applications in catalysis and materials will be uncovered.

"In recent years, dietary lipids have been considered more than just sources of energy. It is now understood that fatty acids and cholesterol may affect gene expression in ways that involve specific nuclear systems termed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) and liver X receptors (LXR). These receptors have been shown to mediate effects of both fatty acids and sterols on lipid metabolism in ways that may affect and individual risk for heart disease and obesity. PPARs have been shown to regulate lipid metabolism including fatty acid oxidation, fat cell development, lipoprotein metabolism and glucose homeostasis. LXRs have been shown to regulate cholesterol absorption, efflux of cholesterol from peripheral cells and metabolism of VLDL. However, possible linkages between PPARs and LXRs, as well as their role in regulating the effect of type of dietary components on lipid metabolism, have yet to be explored. In addition, fatty acids and sterols found in plants (phytosterols) are thought to affect the production of important appetite regulators leptin and ghrelin. The global objective of the present study is to use both in vitro and in vivo models to investigate links between PPARs and LXRs and their role in regulating the effect of different dietary components on lipid metabolism and appetite regulation. To achieve the stated objectives, the in vitro experiments will examine the response to different dietary agents of both known and unknown genes of lipid metabolism using modern genetic profiling analyses. In the second part of the program the role of qualitative fat and sterol consumption will be examined in the regulation of lipid pathways in a mouse model using genes found to be differentially expressed in the initial series of cell-based experiments. It is anticipated that results from the proposed series of experiments should enable innovative nutraceutical/pharmaceutical approaches to improving heart disease and obesity prevalence of Canadians.objective of the present study is to use both in vitro and in vivo models to investigate links between PPARs and LXRs and their role in regulating the effect of different dietary components on lipid metabolism.

"I am primarily interested in the processes underlying memorial influences on performance, especially as they relate to the distinction between conscious memory influences and unconscious memory influences.  Some of the proposed research is a continuation of my work targeted at gaining a better basic understanding of these processes and how they interact in the context of memory for relatively ""neutral"" stimuli such as common words or objects.  However, I've recently become interested in how these processes operate differently when the remembered stimuli are emotionally relevant.  Recent experiments have suggested that the evidence supporting enhanced memory for emotional stimuli is tenuous at best and may reflect the distinctiveness of emotional stimuli more that actual effects of inducing emotions.  These results are surprising given that the brain has structures in place that should enhance memory for emotionally significant events (i.e., the amygdala's activation of the hippocampal system).  A core hypothesis explored in the proposed research is that the inconsistency of lab-based studies of emotional memory partly reflects the absence of a factor typically present in real-world emotional events; suspense.  It is argued that suspense may activate the neural structures that would underlie enhanced memory for emotional events, and if suspense were brought into the laboratory studies, stronger and more consistent results would emerge.  Surprisingly, there exist few if any studies examine the effect of suspense on memory, making the proposed work both novel and relevant.

"How insulin-secreting beta-cells sense glucose is incompletely understood. Our group has developed a modern set of tools that provide a unique opportunity to gain major new insights in this area. The goals of our laboratory are to apply these newly developed tools to study stimulus/secretion coupling mechanisms in insulin-secreting beta-cells. We will investigate the role of lipid production in the control of insulin release from insulin secreting cells. These studies will provide new insights into relevant pathways involved in sensing sugar levels in the blood by insulin-secreting beta-cells and will have important implication towards the understanding of the metabolic regulation of insulin secretion.

"Applied Bayesian Biostatistics 



Bayesian analysis is a statistical paradigm with many advantages for analysing the results of complex medical experiments. In the Bayesian paradigm, past information is combined with that provided by the current study, so that overall conclusions that incorporate all information can be obtained. Importantly, recent advances in computer technology and Bayesian numerical algorithms have freed researchers from the restrictions of standard models, so that the complexity of the model can closely approximate the reality. I will address two particular topics in the Bayesian design and analysis of medical studies: 



First, I will look at the analysis of data from studies that evaluate new diagnostic tests or use diagnostic tests for estimating the prevalence of a condition in a particular population. While seemingly simple, these are in fact difficult estimation problems due to the lack of good tests for many diseases or conditions, which leads to many healthy subjects being diagnosed as diseased, and vice versa. I will develop new methods for such situations, and distribute software so that others can use the methods in their own studies. 



Second, the decision about the number of subjects to include is an important component of the planning of almost all studies. I will look at sample size determination for a wide variety of study designs, including planning studies that use diagnostic tests. In particular, I will look at new criteria for sample size which may lead to quite different sizes compared to currently popular criteria. The main purpose of this work is to enable real medical studies to be both better designed and better analysed.

"At high altitude, the organism of most mammals responds with a series of adjustment that increases the transport of oxygen in the blood and its utilization by the cells. These responses include a gradual increase of ventilation, that develops over several days, due to a progressive increase of sensitivity of specialized cells sensing the decrease of blood oxygenation. Furthermore these responses varies with age (low in newborn and strong in adults), and this development is greatly influenced by environmental oxygen levels. Humans and animals raised under condition of low oxygen (such as occurring at high altitude) have a persistent and paradoxical defect in the ability of these cells to respond to low oxygen, hence their respiratory response is weaker than expected. It is one of our objective to further understand how this decrease of respiratory sensibility to low oxygen will prevent an adequate acclimatization to long-term hypoxia in adults. This question is of interest for the hundreds of millions of humans living at altitude ranging from 2500 to 4500 m worldwide. A secondary question of our research concerns the effect of low oxygen during postnatal development in rats permanently living at high altitude, in the capital-city of Bolivia, at 3600m above sea level. While responses to long-term exposure to low oxygen are well described in adults, studies in newborn are scarce, but are nonetheless critical to better understand how mammals, and men, may survive and develop into well-adapted adults at high altitude. We use rats raised at high altitude to define the contribution of high altitude hypoxia during postnatal development, a critical period for succesful reproduction. Genetic adaptation favors life at altitude, and some genetically adapted rodents are found at extremely high altitude in North America (4500 m). To understand the contribution of genetic background and during postnatal development at high altitude we will study development of respiratory control in these animals. These studies will expend our comprehension of the mechanisms underlying successful life at high altitude, a research area of long-lasting interest in physiology and respiratory biology.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","P�diatrie","Joseph, Vincent","RGPIN ","Animal physiology and metabolism","Animal biology","Biologie animale",1-5
"Human enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism

    )	Xenobiotics are foreign chemicals such as drugs, carcinogens, and pollutants. Foreign compounds are metabolized in the human body in chemically remarkable ways. These metabolic processes, catalyzed by enzymes such as cytochrome P450 and glutathione transferase, can be crucial in determining the toxic effects of chemicals. Therefore, they are of great interest not only in biochemistry but also in the allied disciplines of pharmacology and toxicology. The central theme of Dr. Josephy's research is understanding the biochemistry of the enzymes that catalyze the metabolism of xenobiotics, with particular attention to their protein structures and catalytic functions. His lab. has brought together two different biotechnologies: bacterial mutagenicity assays and recombinant protein expression. In the new assay systems developed in Dr. Josephy's lab., E. coli bacteria are used to detect chemical mutagens, and they are also ""taught"" to metabolize foreign chemicals in the same ways that humans do. That is, human enzymes are expressed as recombinant proteins within the bacterial cells. This approach has led to increasingly reliable and relevant assays for toxic chemicals, and it also provides insight into the mechanisms of action of important human enzymes. The functional effects of naturally occurring variations in these human genes/enzymes, which are being discovered via genome sequencing projects, are now being studied. Another avenue of research is the ""evolution"", in the laboratory, of enzymes with altered sequences and catalytic activities. This aspect of the research program is pursued by randomly mutagenizing the gene encoding the enzyme, and then using the mutagenicity assay to screen libraries of mutants and identify ones with altered activities.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Health, education and social services","Molecular and Cellular Biology","Josephy, David","RGPIN ",Enzymes,Biochemistry,Biochimie,3-5
"The proposed program of research entails the adaptation of scalable multimedia content based on dynamically variable contextual information. The scalable media in question is a single ""high-quality"" (i.e. a file which contains at least the best version of itself; e.g. 1080p video) media file that is able to scale down spatially, temporally, and in terms of its signal-to-noise ratio. This scaling can be achieved through an incremental scheme and/or the storage of redundant information; however the ultimate goal is to obtain a highly compressed file containing a very high degree of scalability (although this may not be ultimately achievable). Contextual information is application dependent, but generally comprises a range of information including the capabilities and condition of the terminal device (such as a mobile phone), the network connection, and even the user's restrictions and capabilities. In order to provide a proper service to a user the context is generally considered as a dynamic input, changing according to the environment, network conditions, other applications being executed on the terminal device, etc. The adaptation process essentially connects scalable media and context together often by making a fuzzy decision (as opposed to a direct binary decision) based on the contextual information provided and correctly scaling the media accordingly (and hopefully dynamically relating to the contextual changes). 



The two key parts of this process are (a) the interpretation of context in order to produce an efficient and effective adaptation process, i.e. to provide the user with the best experience under the given circumstances; and (b) the scalability and size of the media being adapted, efficient storage combined with fine grain control that will enable the best quality for a given situation. We focus these efforts on the constraints imposed by mobile devices and propose new methods to provide improved use of a range of applications - from Tourist Guides to 3D Collaborative Environments.

"The research proposal has three parts: 



(1) The theory of quasi-categories. 

Algebraic geometry and homotopy theory have developed a considerable amount of machinery for solving their problems. The theory of higher stacks is the next tool. Segal categories were introduced by Hirschowitz and Simpson as a framework for developing the theory of higher stacks. But the complexity of this framework makes progress difficult. I propose using quasi-categories instead. The notion of quasi-category was introduced  by Boardman and Vogt more than 30 years ago but its potential was underestimated. I have proved that their expressive power is greater than Segal categories. My goal is to show that category theory can be extended to quasi-categories. I believe that this will have the effect of transfering a huge body of knowledge and intuition from category theory to homotopy theory, higher category theory and higher topos theory.



(2) The algebra and geometry of homology operations.

With Terrence Bisson we have reorganised the algebra of mod 2 Dyer-Lashof operation by using the theory of Q-rings. This includes the multiplicative homology operations in ring spaces. We hope the extend this work to homology modulo an odd prime.



(3) Free bicompletion of categories. 

We plan to publish our work on free bicompletion of categories and to explore its applications to game theory and computer science.

"We are requesting funds to purchase an ultracentrifuge and rotors for cellular subfractionation.  The new ultracentrifuge will replace a much older (~25 years) model that has been the work horse in our Department. Empirical reductionism has for many years been a central and productive approach to cell biology and biochemistry. In this method, complex systems are broken down into their components with the hope that by understanding the components some insight will be gained into the more complex system. One classic way of separating cells into their components remains the spinning of samples at high speed. Special instruments, called ultracentrifuges, are required to do this at very high speeds (generating forces in excess of 500 000 times that of gravity). While cells are the basic units of life they are themselves quite complicated and are defined by multiple subcellular compartments. Each of these compartments carries out specific and defined processes. In order to study the proteins and processes taking place in these compartments it is necessary to separate them from the other components of the cell. They can be separated from one another based on their densities by centrifugation. This proposal is for an ultracentrifuge and the necessary rotors to carry out these types of cellular subfractionation experiments. While the experiments described here involve a number of different organisms (ranging from bacteria to fungi to plants) and subcellular fractions of interest, they are all related by the common thread that they utilize or require ultracentrifugation to be carried out. The progress of the research described here hinges on access to an ultracentrifuge to carry out this cellular subfractionation.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Chemistry and Biochemistry","Joyce, Paul","EQPEQ ","Intra-cellular targeting","Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",1-1
"Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are adaptor molecules that play an essential role in the conversion of information from DNA (its storage form) to protein (its functioning form). In organisms like us tRNAs do not work without the help of the enzyme tRNA nucleotidyltransferase which assists in their production. This enzyme functions in every location (cytosol, mitochondria, plastids) in a cell where tRNAs are needed. If we lack tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, we lack functional tRNAs, we can not make proteins and we die. Given the importance of this enzyme, we must answer some important questions. For example, how does a single gene residing in the nucleus code for multiple forms of this enzyme required in the cytosol, mitochondria and plastids? What are the signals on the enzyme that tell the cell where to send it and what factors in the cell recognize these signals? To answer these questions we will use mutagenesis to make altered forms of the enzyme (having or lacking potential targeting signals) and follow where they go in cells by linking them to easily detectable reporter proteins. The yeast and plant tRNA nucleotidyltransferases are much larger (at least one-third bigger) than their bacterial (E. coli) equivalent. Why are they bigger and can we target antifungal agents or herbicides to these extra regions? To explore this we are making changes in regions unique to the larger tRNA nucleotidyltransferases to see if these altered enzymes still support the life of yeast or, when purified, have catalytic activity in a test tube. We will use enzymatic and biophysical techniques to see how these changes alter enzyme structure and function. Finally, we made a mutant form of this enzyme that is extremely sensitive to elevated temperature and we found second site ""suppressor"" mutations that restore activity. What can the interactions between the mutant residues tell us about the structure and function of this important enzyme and how temperature affects it?","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Chemistry and Biochemistry","Joyce, Paul","RGPIN ","Intra-cellular targeting","Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",2-5

"The development of a new generation of high performance aircraft turbine jet engines requires gas turbines to be operated at very high turbine rotor inlet gas temperatures. This necessitates the development of more innovative cooling techniques for gas turbine blades. The objective of the present proposal is two-fold. The first is to develop a numerical model to predict the film cooling effectiveness for unconventional shaped-holes, different layout row arrangements and internal coolant supply configurations, and injection angles, for smooth flat plate and test blade models. Various turbulence models, including the advanced Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) model with various subgrid scale (SGS) models will be investigated in terms of their ability to capture the main features of the flow and the required computing cost for modeling of such cooling systems. The second is to design and develop an experimental setup to investigate film cooling and heat transfer from macro and micro shaped holes and slots, under different mainstream flow, coolant flow, and surface conditions for flat plate and test blade models. The profiled shapes of the test blade models will be designed to reflect realistic distributions of the Reynolds numbers and acceleration parameters over actual turbine blades. 

The long-term objectives of the research are to expand the knowledge and establish the technical expertise, and tools, that lead to the design and testing of new innovative cooling techniques for gas turbine blades. Moreover, this project will pave the way for establishing an interdisciplinary research program to investigate the effects of manufacturing techniques of cooling configurations on the film cooling effectiveness. The significance of the proposed research program for the Canadian aerospace industry is its contribution towards the development of a new generation of high performance aircraft turbine jet engines. This is essential for the Canadian industry to maintain its competitiveness to produce the best in aircraft, and gas turbine engines.

"The development of industrialized societies requires the use of resources that have to be mined. Among those resources are several important metals (e.g. Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt) that, at present, can only be extracted from deposits formed by cooling of magmas (orthomagmatic deposits) or by interaction of magmas with aqueous fluids (magmatic-hydrothermal deposits). As demands of these metals grow due to the requirements of developed and developing countries and supply diminishes by the progressive exhaustion of known resources, the need to find new deposits for these metals increases. Successful, efficient exploration for these resources and their efficient exploitation relies on our understanding of how such deposits form. Because these resources are limited, every new discovery requires stronger efforts and a better understanding of where mineralization occurs, how these deposits are formed and what controls the spatial distribution of the metals of interests within a particular district. My research is aimed at understanding the geochemical mechanisms that favour the transfer of metals of interest from the Earth's mantle to the crust and the mechanism that control the precipitation of these metals in the anomalous concentrations required for their extraction to be economically feasible. In addition, my research also aims to understand how subsequent thermal events may further remobilize metals and affect the distribution of these metals in their current environments. The goal is to integrate the results of my work with the broader research work on ore deposit genesis to generate models that better predict how and where these deposits can be found in order to optimize exploration and exploitation of these non-renewable resources.

with high precision. PMDi, located in Victoria, BC, has developed a proprietary controller that is capable of

rapid processing of real-time data with very high precision. PMDi is now seeking to implement this controller

for laser ablation in semiconductor industry with high speed and precision. With increased laser powers,

galvanometer scanners capable of fast scanning for increased ablation speed have been developed using

moving magnet galvanometers in order to increase the production rate, and many researchers have investigated

to increase the ablation or etch rate of using different types of lasers. PMDi's controller's excellent capability

can be exploited to further optimize the scanning performance of the galvanometer scanners, thus increasing

the production rate and quality of the ablated parts. The applicant has recently been awarded Canadian

Foundation for Innovation (CFI) Leader's Opportunity Fund and acquired a femtosecond laser system and

started research in femtosecond laser ablation. The advantage of femtosecond laser is that it allows high

quality micromachining of many diverse materials including glass, ceramics, semiconductors, and

difficult-to-machine metals and imposes minimal damage to the surrounding materials and minimal

re-deposition with submicron feature resolution. Using the femtosecond laser at the University of Victoria

(UVic) integrated with a galvanometer scanner and the PMDi's controller, control of a high speed galvanometer

scanner for high precision laser ablation with increased ablation rates can be investigated. This Engage grant

will allow PMDi and the applicant an opportunity to adapt their controller to control high speed galvanometer

laser scanning and understand high speed femtosecond laser ablation. Successful completion of the project

will position PMDi to commercialize their controllers for galvanometer scanning and laser ablation markets

and the applicant to apply femtosecond laser machining in various fields in the industry.","Instrumentation technology","Manufacturing processes and products","Mechanical Engineering","Jun, Martin","EGP   ","Mechanical systems and instrumentation","Mechanical engineering","G�nie m�canique",1-1

"Biomedical scaffolds, which are porous, biocompatible, and biodegradable, serve to support, reinforce, and

guide new tissue growth and organization, and eventually, building or repairing of organs can be done to

provide off-the-shelf replacement body parts. The scaffold thus provides the necessary support for cells to

adhere to and proliferate, and its architecture defines the ultimate shape of the new grown bone tissue. Many

methods have been developed so far to fabricate scaffolds and are versatile in terms of desired geometry

creation and 3D structures. However, one main drawback of these methods is that they are quite slow (less than

25 mm of structures per hour). Also, since water or acid is used as binders for scaffold fabrication, the gel-like

precipitate is typically frozen to maintain the form and freeze drying is employed to dry. However, freeze

drying takes a long time (2-3 days) to dry completely. Thus, including the time of fabrication, production of a

scaffold takes a few days, resulting in significantly decreased profit margin. The main goal of this proposal is to

develop a process to significantly reduce the manufacturing (building and drying) time and cost to allow shorter

lead time and consequently higher profit margin. This can be successfully accomplished through collaboration

with EnWave Corporation, owing to our complementary expertise. The fabrication rate can be substantially

increased by using a microscale atomized droplet (MAD) jet printing device developed at the University of

Victoria. It is expected that more than two-fold reduction in fabrication time can be achieved. The drying time

can be significantly reduced by using EnWave's radiant energy vacuum (REV) drying method, which can dry a

frozen scaffold within 0.5 to 2 hours as opposed to 2 to 3 days with freeze drying. Combining the MAD jet

printing and REV drying technologies, an efficient scaffold manufacturing system can be developed for

successful commercialization of scaffolds as biomedical products. The Engage Grant will be an excellent

opportunity to jump-start the development of such manufacturing system by identifying the processing issues

with the MAD jet printing and REV drying technologies for fabrication and dehydration of scaffolds.","Medical equipment and apparatus","Manufacturing processes and products","Mechanical Engineering","Jun, Martin","EGP   ","Biomedical materials","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",1-1
"As a starting faculty member, I plan to establish a research program on advanced multi-scale manufacturing to develop innovative manufacturing technologies to bridge the gap between nano- and micro-scales, and support the increasing demand for customized miniature 3D parts. The innovative multi-scale manufacturing technologies developed through this program will allow integration of nano-scale devices into practical engineering systems. My initial efforts will be on miniaturization of manufacturing processes and systems. For competitive production to keep pace with micro/nano-scale science and technology, a shift in manufacturing paradigm is required, which is built upon the premise that miniature parts or features can be best created on miniature processes and equipments. Development of miniature or micro-scale machine tools (mMTs) can lead to cost-effective, accurate, flexible, and mobile manufacturing on a desktop so that accurate 3D miniature custom-design parts can be quickly made at a remote location where they are needed or required. Although few efforts have been made to develop mMTs, as the size-scale of the process and equipment is reduced, many new issues arise and remain to be addressed for fully functional and versatile mMTs including cutting fluid application, part handling and assembly, fixturing, metrology, on-line monitoring and control, etc.



The proposed research addresses one of the key issues in micro-scale machining on mMTs - effective the cutting fluid application. An atomization-based cutting fluid application system for micro-machining on mMTs is taken as a viable solution. As the size-scale is reduced, different cutting mechanisms take place such as excessive ploughing and rubbing, and this causes the tool wear to be a significant problem. The proposed research is aimed at understanding dynamics and tribological properties of atomized droplets in micro-machining, investigating their effects on the machining process, developing an optimized cutting fluid application system for improved surface quality and tool life, and integrating the system to an mMT.

"In this proposed 3-year project, in collaboration with one Canadian company (Danieli-Corus) and two South Korean partners (POSCO and RIST), we will investigate the phase equilibria of oxides containing P2O5 and CaF2 in order to better understand their phase diagrams and complex chemical reactions. The two oxide systems investigated in the present study are the CaO-SiO2-FeO-Fe2O3-P2O5 and the CaO-SiO2-Al2O3-Na2O-CaF2-NaF. Experimental data for these systems are still not sufficient and are often quite inconsistent with each other. The proposed project will use a coupled experimental and thermodynamic modeling technique to save time and reduce research cost. Phase equilibrium experiments under controlled gas atmosphere will be performed using various methods such as a classical quenching technique, DTA, DSC and TGA followed by the XRD and EPMA phase analyses. In the same time, a thermodynamic modeling will be performed to provide new experimental directions. In the final stage, the Gibbs energy model parameters for all phases will be simultaneously optimized to reproduce all reliable experimental data. The resultant computational model parameters will be combined with the currently available FACT oxide database to predict the complex phase equilibria and chemical reactions occurring in the industrial steelmaking processes. The industrial partners will also provide valuable in-house experimental data and evaluate the accuracy of the thermodynamic calculations compared with their own experimental data. Feedback from the partners will enhance the accuracy of the thermodynamic modeling. Results of the project will be applied to the optimization of the current processes and new mold flux design in steelmaking. The knowledge of the project will contribute to the quality improvement of advanced high strength steel for automotive applications. At a larger scale, this study will be useful to the general pyrometallurgy, cement, glassmaking and combustion industries as well as to the geological community.","Primary metal products (ferrous and non-ferrous)","Manufacturing processes and products","Mining & Materials Engineering.","Jung, InHo","CRDPJ ",Metallurgy,"Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",1-3
"There is, as yet, no rigorous approach to select a group of elements to create a material with specified properties. However, in order to examine the possibilities of any combination of elements, thermodynamic information is undoubtedly the first step. Even though thermodynamics is fundamental to the understanding and design of materials, hard data and comprehensive models are in very short supply. However, in recent years, with the improvement of computational techniques and software, design of materials based on, or facilitated by, thermodynamic principles has gained much ground. Moreover, thermodynamic approaches to optimize materials processing has also gained considerable ground, and will continue to penetrate the industry. In order to develop a rational approach to materials and materials processing design, knowledge of thermodynamic properties of advanced materials must accelerate. Improved thermodynamic modeling based on newly acquired thermodynamic data is also required. In spite of its significance, however, since phase diagram measurement is expensive and time-consuming, systematic experimental studies have rarely been performed in recent years. Only very limited materials systems of perceived major industrial interest are currently being investigated experimentally. Therefore, new innovative methodology must be invented in order to continue the thermodynamic research on new materials pace with the advance of materials. In this work, thermodynamic research for new materials such as fuel cell materials, bio-medical glasses, aerospace materials and light alloys will be carried out using an innovative coupled thermal analysis experiment and thermodynamic modeling method. As a result of the research, an invaluable computerized thermodynamic database will be compiled. This database will be used for advanced computer-aided material design and process analysis, which will drastically reduce the experimental expense and time to develop advanced materials. The research will be of benefit to a wide range of areas, including fuel cell, bio-medical engineering, aerospace, electronics, light alloys, chemical processing, glasses, ceramics and nuclear.

"Funds are requested to maintain the Canadian Scientific Submersible Facility (CSSF) and ROPOS, Canada's only deep ocean submersible, as a world-class facility, provide access at greatly reduced rates for  Canadian academic researchers, and support ROPOS mobilization on shipboard for Canadian-led science expeditions. Since 1996, 265 Canadian faculty, students and post-doctoral fellows from 14 universities in 8 provinces across Canada have occupied 587 places on ROPOS expeditions. More than 150 publications including feature articles, have resulted from ROPOS use. Recent highlights include: 

- Nature publication and inclusion in NSERC's 2006 Top 50 Discoveries for documenting undersea volcanic eruption

- Discovery/sampling venting gas at seafloor hydrate mounds

- Discovery of previously unknown co-occurring photosynthetic and chemosymbiotic ecosystems

- In situ observation and sampling of deep water corals off Canada's Atlantic and Pacific coasts

- Successful installation of the VENUS cabled observatory 

- Search and recovery of data from a sunken BC Ferry 

Access to ROPOS has made it possible for Canadian ocean scientists to become established world leaders in several areas of deep-sea research and for Canada to become a world pioneer in cabled deep-sea observatories. Previous Major Facilities Access awards permitted CSSF to build and maintain a team of experienced electronics, navigation and mechanical technologists essential to deep-sea research initiatives and achieving a high standard of equipment reliability. Recent external upgrade funds greatly expanded ROPOS' capabilities: 1) deployment on a wider range of support vessels 2) state-of-the-art subsea navigation system for metre-scale precision, 3) increased manipulation and lift capabilities, 4) 3 new operating configurations, including a new mid-depth system and 5) ability to share live ROPOS video and data with users ashore.    )

"DNA Double-strand breaks represent the most lethal form of damage in the genome, resulting in genetic loss and/or chromosomal re-arrangement if not properly repaired.  Sources of ionizing radiation (IR) responsible for such damage include cosmic radiation, radon and the decay of radioactive material left over from nuclear weapons testing and spent nuclear fuel generated during power production.  Not surprisingly, tolerable levels of exposure to such ionizing radiation are exceedingly small for all forms of life.  One notable exception is the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans.  Deinococcus is able to withstand a dose of ionizing radiation 1500 times greater than humans can survive and one that would obliterate the E. coli genome 10 times over.  Remarkably, despite being shattered into hundreds of small DNA fragments, Deinococcus radiodurans readily reassembles a functional genome.  This feat has been attributed to the combination of a number of protective mechanisms including the presence of multiple genome copies, characteristic genome structure, and known or novel DNA repair mechanisms.  Although traditional repair mechanisms appear to be active in D. radiodurans, the speed and accuracy of repair displayed are inconsistent with all previously characterized pathways.  

      The goal of our research is to understand how uncharacterized proteins, implicated in DNA repair, function to permit the amazing DNA repair capabilities of  Deinococcus radiodurans.  Understanding the DNA repair strategies utilized to resist extreme IR damage is not only fascinating from a scientific point of view, but also carries great potential for practical utility.  Deinococci are of interest for application in bioremediation of toxins from radioactive contaminated environments generated through processing of nuclear fuel.  In addition, NASA is exploring these organisms with the idea of eventually using information gained to increase protection form IR during prolonged space travel.

"Objective: Integrative computational biology is a necessary platform to fathom biology of complex diseases and impact individualized medicine. However, advancing computational tools in isolation is insufficient to impact computational biology. Many theoretically excellent approaches are inadequate for the high-throughput biological domains, due to the scale or complexity of the problem, or due to using unrealistic assumptions. Forming hypotheses and developing computational models of biological systems without the possibility to test them limits the potential to derive realistic models. We propose to improve scalability robustness, sensitivity and specificity of pattern discovery algorithms, and integrate them to support a methodical approach to the systems biology analysis and visualization of high-throughput data in cancer research.

   Approach: To address challenges in cancer informatics, we propose to: 1) integrate multiple data resources into biological data marts; 2) design tools for systematic, network-based analysis of heterogeneous biological data; 3) apply the tools to modeling epithelial cancers and initiate validation studies via collaborations. We will augment the tools with statistical and machine learning algorithms to enable probabilistic reasoning, deterministic and sound pattern identification, stability, scalability and robustness. There are three main areas of algorithm development: 1) clustering and data mining algorithms for cancer profiles; 2) graph theory algorithms for protein interaction networks; and 3) integration and visualization of results in the context of networks, to aid in hypotheses generation, interpretation of results, and model creation.

      Significance: We aim to develop integrated and scalable algorithms, and apply them to realize intelligent molecular medicine. Results from these analyses will be integrated into the computational models, which will improve their accuracy and thus applicability, and in turn will impact in the respective fields. An important function of this proposal is the training of bioinformatics professionals for which there is still a severe deficit. We will release tools and resources for free academic use.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Computer Science","Jurisica, Igor","RGPIN ","Learning and inference theories","Artificial intelligence","Intelligence artificielle",3-5

"The upcoming proposal will be a follow-up of the previous, which was dedicated to the study of upper Mississippian continental clastic rocks and phreatic calcretes that are marginal to the marine Windsor Group of southeastern Canada. The study also involved the subsequent deformation of these rocks in Pennsylvanian times (Jutras et al., 2003a, GSA Bull. 115: 1538-1551; Jutras et al., 2003b, Atl. Geol. 39: 201-211). The recent discovery of an oil reservoir hosted by Pennsylvanian fault breccia in eastern Gasp�sie, QC (Well Galt #3, presently exploited by JUNEX and Petrolia) calls for greater emphasis to be placed on the post-sedimentary deformation of the late Mississippian basins of southeastern Canada, although the main emphasis of the ongoing study will remain on the sedimentology, stratigraphy and diagenesis of their marginal marine/continental clastic units. The study will eventually involve correlations with age equivalent rocks of Europe in order to obtain a greater picture of the pre-rifting paleogeography of upper Paleozoic successor basins in the Appalachian/Caledonian orogenic belt. In a nutshell, the ongoing research aims at obtaining a better understanding of the tectonic controls on the Windsor Sea invasion and paleogeographic evolution through the study of near coast, continental and shallow marine deposits. It also aims at obtaining a better definition of late Mississippian basin architectures and stratigraphic relationships in marginal marine areas in order to facilitate eventual oil and gas exploration in these units.

"There is a growing body of literature indicating that phase dietary 2 protein inducing phytochemicals (P2PIs) ameliorate chronic diseases that have an underlying oxidative stress component. The quintessential example of a dietary P2PI is the isothiocyanate sulforaphane, which is found in broccoli and other cruciferous plants. However, only a limited number of dietary phase 2 protein inducers have been identified to date. The current proposal builds on an earlier pilot project whereby a number of plant extracts were screened for the ability to induce phase 2 protein gene expression, leading to the identification of both known and novel phytochemicals that function as P2PIs. Within the scope of this proposal, we intend to: 1) Produce extracts from the plants in the Canadian flora with a history of use as foods or medicines and screen them for phase 2 protein inducing activity, 2) Develop new cell-based screening assays to test for phase 1 and phase 2 protein inducing potential, 3) Isolate and identify the phytochemicals responsible for phase 2 protein inducing activities in these exstracts, and 4) Test select phase 2 inducing compounds in an animal model of chronic disease. These activities will employ novel techniques developed to rapidly screening plant extracts and delineate possible phase protein inducing phytochemcials. The most promising novel candidates will then be tested in relevant animal models of chronic disease for efficacy in ameliorating adverse events associated with hypertension, global tissue inflammation and type 2 diabetes. Achieving these objectives will improve understanding of the content of P2PIs in plants that are consumed as foods or herbal products, and potentially lead to the identification of novel bioactive phytochemicals for use in preventive medicines (e.g., as nutraceuticals and functional foods). In addition, new knowledge gained from this work may aid in the identification of new crops, validation of existing natural health products, provide for improved dietary recommendations and promote the development of the nutraceutical industry.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Anatomy and Cell Biology","Juurlink, Bernhard","CHRPJ ","Life sciences research related to human health and disease","Life sciences research related to human health and disease","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines",2-3

"This project investigates digital processing techniques as applied to the processing of speech and audio signals. We will investigate new approaches to faithfully coding audio signals at rates below those now achievable with current technology. The approach is to allocate scarce bit resources to the time-frequency regions of the audio signal in which they are most needed. The criterion will be based on the psychoacousic properties of human hearing. Coding at lower rates translates to reductions in storage space, but probably more importantly, allows for less demand on the network for streaming audio.



We will use the same types of techniques to investigate methods for the enhancement of the quality speech and audio signals. The types of noise or distortion that can be handled include background noise picked up by the recording microphone, reverberation, and distortion introduced by coding.

"Randomness has become an indispensable tool in many areas of computer science: algorithm design, networking, error-correcting codes, cryptography, etc. While the use of randomness is unavoidable for certain applications (e.g., cryptographic constructions), other applications can be made completely deterministic. One of the main challenges of theoretical computer science is to understand the exact power of randomness in computation. In particular, it is a big open question whether every randomized polynomial-time algorithm has an equivalent deterministic polynomial-time algorithm (i.e., can be efficiently derandomized). Answering this question is important for algorithm design, as fast deterministic algorithms are usually preferable to randomized ones. On the other hand, there is a deep connection between trying to derandomize probabilistic algorithms and trying to prove lower bounds on the computational power of Boolean circuits. The latter problem has been actively researched for several decades with the goal of resolving the ""P vs. NP"" question. However, no strong circuit lower bo unds are known for any explicit Boolean function.



The goal of the proposed research is to explore various aspects of the basic question: to what extent is randomness useful in computation?

"Military naval task-force operations are operations involving several national or allied platforms that are coordinated to achieve given missions. In such operations, threat evaluation is the process of observing the behaviour of potentially hostile entities, such as enemy aircraft or missiles, to determine their goals, plans, intent, capability and opportunity for causing damage to protected assets. This process is conducted by human operators based on information provided mainly through a tactical picture. Given the very high complexity of naval task-force threat evaluation tasks, a decision support system is required to enhance decision quality by reducing the risk of errors for operators, and provide cognitive support to reduce their workload. This project brings together CAE (a Canadian world leading company in training simulators) and the Universit� de Sherbrooke to investigate, design, implement, and evaluate such a decision support system. The key components of this system will be novel threat evaluation expert models and user models, together with original system architecture and algorithms that process these models to provide useful support to operators during threat evaluation. The same system will be used to guide students/trainees in learning threat evaluation concepts through simulations. Additionally, the system will generate performance traces that will assist instructors in evaluating students/trainees and determining their needs for further training or additional courses. Considering that threat evaluation is an important problem in other areas, not just military (for example, network security), this project will also indirectly contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the design of decision support tools for threat evaluation in similar domains. The project will also enable graduate students to gain a valuable expertise and become highly qualified in a very sensitive field much needed for Canada.","Computer software","Information and communication services",Informatique,"Kabanza, Froduald","CRDPJ ","Information technology","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",2-4

"Flat-panel digital X-ray image sensors based on an X-ray detecting medium (either a photoconductor or a phosphor) with a self-scanned active matrix arrays provide excellent X-ray images. These image sensors capture an X-ray image electronically, and hence enable a clinical transition to digital radiography by replacing the traditional film based system. Digital imaging has tremendous implications from a clinical standpoint.  Not only do they allow doctors to retrieve and inspect images quicker, they are highly portable and can be analyzed by specialists who are off-site. X-ray detectors are now commercially available for general radiography and mammography, and are under consideration for use in fluoroscopy. However, there still remain significant scientific challenges associated with dark current, image lag and ghosting, electronic noises, X-ray induced effects and long term stability of the detector. Therefore, there is much fundamental work to be done to enhance detector performance. The objectives of the proposed research are to determine the physical mechanisms causing dark current, transient photoresponse, avalanche gain and noise, X-ray induced change in detector sensitivity (ghosting) and resolution in image detectors, via detector modeling and characterization tasks. A secondary objective of this research is to investigate the material properties of X-ray photoconductors. 

  

The proposed work is vital to understand the physics of detector operation and material properties, to enhance detector performance, and also to identify the important factors that limit the detector performances, which can ultimately lead to the reduction of patient exposure/dose consistent with a better diagnosis. This research work will help X-ray detector community to overcome the present problems in X-ray image detectors, which will influence the rapid commercialization of the X-ray image sensors for cheap medical digital X-ray imaging. This research has direct benefit to Canada's health system as well. Personnel trained by this research will constitute highly skilled workforce for our electronic industries and hospitals.

"As a developmental biologist, I study the role of fetal movements in providing continuity between prenatal and postnatal life. There are two major categories of fetal motility. The first category consists of movements that have an obvious effect on the survival or development of the fetus (e.g., changes of position, sucking and swallowing). The second category consists of fetal movements that anticipate postnatal functions. For example, fetal ocular movements predict postnatal eye function (e.g., motion vision) of the newborn, while the fetal breathing-like movements predict postnatal lung function. Both categories of fetal motility are important indicators of fetal health. However, while the clinical significance of fetal motility is obvious, its biological significance is elusive.

    )	I propose to use retina and lung of genetically modified mouse embryos to study the biological role of fetal ocular and breathing movements in the genesis of cell diversity and organ functional maturation. Our results have already demonstrated the importance of fetal motility in differentiation of specific cell types in the retina and lung.

    )	In the current proposal, I suggest employing the unique opportunity provided by the mouse mutants to identify a group of candidate genes that are essential for the molecular regulation of retinal and lung development and in turn for their functional maturation. Subsequently, our goal is to study human fetal hypoplastic lung tissues in order to identify a marker for pulmonary hypoplasia and to establish a protocol for lung tissue engineering.

    )	I believe that the results of these studies will increase our understating of the particular aspects of cell differentiation and of the visual and respiratory system function, therefore increasing the knowledge in the field and helping in medical practices and applications, such as conditions characterized by inability of gaze stabilization and/or spatiotemporal interactions (e.g., as occurs while steering the car) or in pulmonary hypoplasia, an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality.

It is also the most species rich group of microscopic plants with an estimated 200,000+ species. Diatoms are a relatively new evolutionary arrival, suggesting a high rate of speciation. The mechanism(s) of diatom speciation are unknown.



The long term objective of my research is to advance the understanding of diatom evolution and speciation through investigation of the reproductive processes, sex-cell structures and breeding systems in key diatom lineages. In the current proposal, the short term objectives are to test hypotheses explaining how similar morphology might have evolved in unrelated groups and how informative the structure of diatom sex-cells is in inferring evolution of individual lineages. We also want to find out if the nuclear encoded internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) RNA transcript secondary structure is consistent with other biota and whether compensatory base changes (CBCs) in the strongly conserved regions of the transcript may predict sexual incompatibility in diatoms, thus helping to identify target organisms for breeding experiments. Finally we plan to conduct the first ever investigation of pattern of inheritance in diatoms, using crosses between first generation progeny including putative homozygous recessive and heterozygous dominant partners.



Our work will contribute to a better understanding of diatom evolution, genetics and ecology (including economically important, cryptic or harmful species). We know very little regarding the frequency or relative importance of any of these processes in the life histories of most marine centric diatoms. In light of scarcity of data and diversity of theories regarding diatom ecology and evolution, experimental data is obviously needed.

"Aortic stenosis (AS) is defined as the pathological narrowing of the aortic valve. It is the most frequent valvular heart disease and the most frequent cardiovascular disease after systemic hypertension and coronary artery disease in Europe and North America. Currently, cardiac catheterization and Doppler echocardiography are the most frequently used methods for the determination of aortic stenosis severity. However, cardiac catheterization has significant technical limitations and it is an invasive technique that may place the patient at unnecessary risk while Doppler echocardiography has several practical and theoretical limitations that limit its applicability in around 20% of the patients with aortic stenosis. In a recent in vitro study, we developed, using particle image velocimetry (PIV), a new accurate method to determine the severity of aortic stenosis from the velocity field. Although very promising, the applicability of this method was limited in vivo because PIV requires transparent structures. However, this is not the case for magnetic resonance phase contrast (MR PC). In fact, MR PC is a powerful non-invasive, non-ionizing technique, able to investigate the velocity field through human heart valves. The objective of the present study is, therefore, to determine in vitro and in vivo the feasibility and the accuracy of our new method applied to the velocity field measured by MR PC. Furthermore, we will investigate the ability of MR PC to compute turbulence characteristics downstream of an aortic stenosis. We expect that the results of this project will have a significant impact on the clinical evaluation of the severity of aortic stenosis.

"Carbon/graphite fibres are arguably some of the most important and widely used advanced engineering marterials.  Lightweight fatigue resistance materials, they possess high strength/modulus and high stiffness.  Advanced fibres, such as carbon fibres (CF) are routinely being used in sports equipment, marine products, and the transportation industries.Lignin is an ideal biopolymer precursor for the production of carbon fibres.  It is a polyaromatic macromolecule thought to be a petroleum progenitor.  Lignin-based products such as carbon fibres are a vital component of the Pulp and paper biorefinery strategy; applying the biorefinery concept allows the creation of high-value co-products that can improve profitability and increase efficiency of the whole operation.  Lignin-based fibres/carbon fibres proide a unique opportunity to not only enhance the economics of papermaking, but also reduce vehicle weight by replacing steel in various automotive components.  This project will investigatethe development of carbon fibres and nanofibres from lignin. Using advanced separationtechnologies we will evaluate various fractionated lignin preparations for carbon fibre production and fibre properties, and explore the applicability for large scale carbon fibre and nanofibre production.","Wood, wood products and paper","Manufacturing processes and products","Wood Science","Kadla, John","CRDPJ ",Composites,"Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",1-3
"The development of biologically derived materials and fuels is emerging as an important component for economic development in Canada. By transforming forest and agricultural feedstocks, a new class of renewable, biodegradable and biocompatible materials (biomaterials) is being introduced. Rising oil prices and uncertainty over the security of existing fossil reserves, combined with concern over global climate change, has created the need for new transportation fuels and for the manufacture of bioproducts to substitute fossil-based materials. There is an important and urgent need to develop the know-how for the production of novel high-performance products from lignocellulosic materials, coming either as byproducts of current processes or

It is recognized that a bottleneck for the economical viability of bioconversion processes is the allocation of residual lignins and cellulose. Thus, the general objective of this research program is to use abundant renewable agricultural byproducts such as lignin and cellulose as precursors for the production of high performance fibres and functionalized materials. The properties of lignin-based fibres and carbon fibres will be

"The Forest Industry is one of Canada's largest industries and the economic mainstay of many communities across the country.  It is facing great challenges due to competition from low cost sources of wood and declining demand for some of its products. The Industry is at a crossroads and must change. Production of new, high value products rather than traditional commodity products is the path to the future. Lignin is one of the primary components of wood, second only to cellulose in abundance. When wood is pulped to obtain cellulose fibres, approximately 20 % of wood is dissolved as lignin. This is currently used a fuel in pulp mills. However, lignin also has the potential to be a biomass feedstock for various products. While it has been used for some time to make adhesives, dispersants and surfactants, exciting new research is pointing

the way to lignin-derived carbon-fibre composites for strong, light automobile parts, carbon aerogels for hydrogen storage, and new biobased polymers, to name a few. The aim of this Network is to develop technology platforms to deliver this next generation of biomaterials and chemicals from lignin. The Network consists of 16 professors in science and engineering from 11 universities across Canada, including five Canada Research Chairs and three Distingusihed Professors. The work will be carried out primarily with masters and doctoral students, thereby training a new generation of scientists and engineers for

the forest industry of the future.

"In wireless mesh networks (WMNs), mobile IPTV service demands the support of multicast communication with quality-of-service (QoS) assurance. To achieve QoS guaranteed multicast, we consider to employ the following mechanisms: MAC Layer Enhancement, Prioritized Guaranteed Rate (GR) Packet Scheduling, Hybrid Error Control, and Traffic Engineering Enabled QoS Multicast Routing. MAC Layer Enhancement and Prioritized GR Packet Scheduling aim to reduce the delay and suppress the jitter for mobile IPTV service. Specifically, we will first improve the standardized IEEE 802.11 MAC layer, so that IPTV applications can have more media assess opportunity. We will then design a prioritized scheduling algorithm, which can give mobile IPTV top preference during the packet switching process in multi-service environment. Besides delay and jitter, bit error rate is another important QoS concern of mobile IPTV users. Accordingly, we will develop a new hybrid error control scheme that integrates interleaving, forward error correction (FEC), and automatic repeat request (ARQ) to mitigate the error and loss effects encountered in WMNs. All three mechanisms mentioned above will be provided to mobile IPTV applications through the QoS Multicast Routing process.  To address the efficiency of resource usage in WMN, we will develop a network graph preprocess approach, which enhances the multicast routing protocols with traffic engineering function. 

In addition to above considerations, it is also crucial to support mobile users roaming around the WMN without service interruption. This motivates us to develop an efficient fast handoff approach using distributed computing technology. Particularly, we will work on a mobile agent (MA) based handoff approach, which can significantly reduce handoff delay. In our mobile agent based handoff approach, it is very important to deploy call admission control (CAC) mechanism on the mesh router because it is an essential step for the provision of QoS guaranteed service and it will give handoff calls higher priority than new calls.

"The goal of this research is to improve software developers' productivity and confidence in their products by expanding the use of relational abstractions in different stages of software development.  It is well-known that in many application areas, in particular where networks of any kind are involved, concise relation-algebraic specifications are available for many tasks.  This research will open up new ways to make many of these specifications executable, with efficient, automatically tuned implementations.  In addition, similar formulations can be used in a wide range of applications, including ""fuzzy"" decision finding, configuration changes via graph transformations, and communication protocols.  This research will build a unified framework of tool support for specifying, programming, and reasoning in this family of languages.  It will study both stand-alone relation-based specification and programming, and embedding in functional programming, as well as new foundations for functional-logic programming.



The unified approach to programming and specification taken by this research will open up more efficient ways of software development, in particular in the increasingly many application areas where software is used in safety-critical environments, and therefore must be certified as correct.



Several strands of the more foundational aspects of this research will be used together to enable, as a practical application, generation of high-performance code to be used in medical imaging.  In this project, the theoretical foundations of this research will aid in constructing also the proofs that the generated medical imaging software satisfies its mathematical specifications, stated in the language of signal processing.

"Of the most common types of rockbursts in underground mines (fault slip, pillar burst and strain burst), fault slip (FS) is often the most disruptive. Despite an increasing number of incidents worldwide and the consequent huge economic impact on mines as well as the health & safety risk to workers -- and despite significant advances in seismic data interpretation -- relatively little focused research has been undertaken to address the problem of controlling FS events in mining. There is even less known about the relationship between underground rockmass geology and FS events. 



A workshop will take place January 20-21, 2009 in Toronto. This workshop will involve invited geology experts from Canada and around the world, comprising academia, government and the private sector. This two-day event will have three main goals within the context of geology implications in FS events:



1. Identify and classify the realms of expertise represented.

2. Identify where are the gaps in knowledge, data utilization, and technology

3. What topics are of highest relevance and urgency relating to understanding rockmass geology and its relationship to rock bursting, specifically FS rock bursts. 



The deliverable will be a workshop report comprising: (1) workshop results summary; (2) a listing of attendees and their respective areas of expertise; (3) a list of potential linkages between specific companies, organizations, institutions which emerge from the workshop; (4) next steps required to further develop and focus the outcomes. One or more additional meetings will be undertaken to identify a specific research topic/theme and project(s).

"Despite the current financial turmoil, the mining sector is growing, likely with a long cycle period, creating a unique economic opportunity for Canada to expand its mineral production.  Finding a new ore body, however, takes years and getting a new mine permitted and operational typically takes 8 to 15 yrs.  Hence, it is most attractive to expand the mine life by going deeper.  Unfortunately, mining at depth is more costly and investors are only willing to commit capital if a project can be executed at low risk to workers, investors, society and the environment.  This research focuses on the first two aspects.  

The stakeholders, as recipients of research, have identified 3 geomechanics aspects needing fundamental and applied research: (1) Rock and rock mass strength for engineering at depth; (2) Assessment and mitigation of risk when mining in structurally complex ore bodies; and (3) Engineering design for optimal constructability to achieve high rates of advance.

The proposed research deals with challenges identified through recent experiences from deep underground construction and mines.  Based on field observations, 3 key deficiencies in current rock engineering are identified: (1) Rock and Rock mass failure criteria - standard approaches for strength determination and respective constitutive models are flawed for brittle rock; (2) Strength at depth - based on field experience, the hypothesis is advanced that the rock mass strength at depth is underestimated; potentially leading to uneconomic designs; (3) Design for constructability - at depth, failure processes are more pervasive and raveling / stand-up time issues dominate design; leading to delays and cost overruns.

The research, involving fundamental studies, field monitoring and observations, and back-analyses, will develop means to properly characterize the rock at depth, to obtaining appropriate numerical modeling and design parameters, and to develop ground control means and risk mitigation measures for mining and construction in highly stressed rock.

"This proposal aims at constructing well defined macromolecular heterostructures, and explores their potential in performing multiple predetermined functions, cooperatively and efficiently. These platforms that can provide a synergistic combination of individual and characteristic functionalities, makes them of relevance in a variety of areas including sensors, recognition/delivery vehicles and catalysis. The key to simplicity with which a library of these compositionally diverse dendrimers will be delivered, is the chemoselectivity of amino-stannanes towards acetylenes. Starting from a central core with two distinct focal groups, it will allow efficient build-up of one arm using aminosilanes, followed by second shell hierarchy outward using aminostannanes. The versatility of the approach offers the potential to introduce a variety of dendron structures with a tailored combination of backbones for desired functions. A detailed understanding of the self-organization of these diblock dendrimers that will be investigated extensively in solution and at interfaces, will provide a facile access to novel assemblies with regions of localized functional density. Dendrimers developed in this proposal will be used to fabricate a variety of size and shape controlled metallic nanoparticles. The spatially defined multimetallic systems that will be assembled using bifunctional dendrimers, are excellent candidates in designing co-operative catalysts that can carry out multiple organic transformations in a single pot. In addition, we shall explore self-assembly of a block of these dendrimers into discrete shapes, and then employ the second arm to synthesize nanoparticles at the resulting pre-determined positions. This provides a relatively simple supramolecular approach to fabricate morphologically controlled nanostructures which is essential for tailoring their unique behavior. The broader impact of this proposal is to build cumulative knowledge base on multi-component products, which will be extremely useful in assembling a wide variety of nanoscale structures, and will address key issues in chemistry and materials science.","Materials sciences","Advancement of knowledge",Chemistry,"Kakkar, Ashok","RGPIN ","Polymer synthesis","Polymer chemistry","Chimie des polym�res",2-5

"The focus of this program of research is the application of hyperspectral remote sensing for monitoring ecosystem health and phenological changes over time in a temperate forest environment in Mount St. Hilaire Quebec. This proposed program of research involves the collection of high temporal frequency in-situ spectral data and satellite hyperspectral imagery and integrates them with ecosystem composition, chemistry and structure information.  The in-situ spectral data will be collected through an innovative network of microspectrometers placed throughout the forest canopy. The products of this nexus of data will be spatially explicit predictive models of canopy biochemistry, structure and gas exchange.  In addition, this program of research will address the integration and analysis of hyperspectral data on a computer cluster of Cell based processors and a distributed computing network to create an optimized scheme for the processing of large volumes of hyperspectral data and their interactive three dimensional visualization.

"Reactive grinding, a technique developed in our laboratory allows to prepare nanocrystalline perovskites. These materials have exceptional properties in oxido-reduction processes not only because perovskites in general can sustain high concentrations of oxygen vacancies but also because in nanoperovskites the numerous grain boundaries are regions of high oxygen mobility. These materials are therefore considered as excellent oxygen carriers for the process of chemical looping combustion (CLC). This process is of high significance for large scale combustions in power plants because its flameless combustion is of high power efficiency and the CO2 generated is not diluted in atmospheric nitrogen. Using CLC will therefore contribute to lowering the greenhouse gas CO2 release to atmosphere. By lowering the temperature of both the oxidation and reduction temperature of the CLC process, the nanoperovskites oxygen carriers will enhance the efficiency and cost of this process. The project is to make a systematic study of nanoperovskites in this context.","Energy efficiency","Energy resources","G�nie chimique","Kaliaguine, Serge","STPGP ","Fuel and energy technology (economic geology, use 4003)","Fuel and energy technology","Combustibles et technologie de l'�nergie",2-3

The new membranes will allow to add a new membrane separation process, developed in Canada, in the treatment of natural gas.

"Acetylcholine, often abbreviated as ACh, was the first neurotransmitter to be identified. It is involved in the stimulation of muscle as well as communication in nerves through out the body and between cells in the brain. In the brain, ACh is released from cells that are involved in learning and memory and mental health issues that involve memory loss relate directly or indirectly to alterations in the levels of ACh. These cells depend on the protein nerve growth factor (NGF) for their survival and maintenance.  NGF binds to and activates a protein, known as the TrkA receptor on the surface of the ACh-releasing cells. This NGF-TrkA complex then becomes internalized and is transported to the cell body where it can regulate the expression of genes that are critical for the survival of these cells. The mechanisms that regulate the expression of these genes are not completely understood, however it is clear that the binding of NGF to TrkA is necessary. In the proposed studies, we will use cellular and molecular biology to gain a better understanding of how NGF enhances gene expression in these cells. Recently, the molecule nitric oxide has been implicated in these actions of NGF so our specific aim is to understand how NO contributes to the NGF-mediated survival of ACh-releasing cells. Not only has NO has been reported to act as an important cellular messenger, in some situations NO acts as a neurotoxin.  In order to elucidate the these mechanisms, we propose to investigate the role of NO in the uptake of NGF into ACh-releasing cells, the signalling events that NGF-TrkA activates once inside these cells and in the modulation of the expression of genes necessary for maintaining the health of these cells. Understanding how NO influences gene expression could be useful in identifying the protective versus toxic effects of NO in the brain.  Mapping out the receptor-mediated elements that lead to gene transcription in these cells will contribute to a broader understanding of how activation of multiple signalling pathways can lead to specific cellular responses in a number of biological processes and could be useful in the design of diagnostic tests or therapies that would maintain the health of brain cells or halt aspects of cell loss.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Biomedical Sciences","Kalisch, Bettina","RGPIN ","Cell biology","Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",2-2

" Musculoskeletal ailments, including osteoporosis and bone and joint injuries, currently affect several hundred million people worldwide. These conditions result in a decreased quality of life for many people and a considerable ongoing cost to health care systems. Recently, tissue engineering has emerged as a potential new alternative for treating affected individuals. Tissue engineering involves combining cells with a scaffold support to generate functional replacement tissues. In particular, the use of embryonic stem cells is being investigated as a potential source of cells to regenerate tissues. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can divide to form many cells, and are pluripotent, meaning mat they possess the ability to form any tissue type in the body. Recently, we have successfully generated bone and cartilage tissue in small-scale stationary cultures of mouse ESCs, which we have begun to integrate into biodegradable scaffolds. As a result of the high level of tissue demand for clinical use, many more cells will be required. We will use our success with the model (mouse) system as a basis for the proposed research, which will examine the large-scale production and differentiation, of human ESCs in computer-controlled bioreactors. Our long-term goal will be to apply our approach to the human clinical setting. Hence, one of the outcomes of this work, successful production of bone and cartilage tissue, will be highly beneficial to the thousands of Canadians who suffer from joint injuries and diseases. Our work will have worldwide implications towards the progress and advancement of the field of tissue engineering. Other immediate outcomes of the research will include the coalescence of a multidisciplinary team with expertise in bioengineering, engineering physics, biophysics, biology, and mathematics around a unique medical problem and the development of a unique training program involving biomedical engineering and stem cell biology.

"Sequences of symbols or strings drawn from some (finite or infinite) alphabet appear in many applications where  objects can be encoded into strings in natural ways. Such sequences are often  viewed as realizations of stochastic processes also known as  ``information sources''.



In many applications, when dealing with information sources, one naturally faces the following two tasks: analyzing/estimating sources properties and changing them in certain desirable ways. An important quantity characterizing an information source is its entropy (entropy rate). Entropy appears in many applications in digital and analog communications, biology, chemistry, physics, etc. For example, in studying chaotic dynamical systems, measuring the entropy of a (symbolic) dynamical system is important for deciding whether the system is chaotic. The long-term objectives of this research program are to develop methods  and design efficient algorithms for measuring  and estimating information-theoretic properties/quantities of information sources such as entropy,  relative entropy and conditional entropy; and to design efficient algorithms for source transformation.

"The research covers aspects of process simulation, optimization, and control, in injection molding, film blowing, micro-injection molding, and laser welding. Modeling will predict product microstructure and properties, in addition to process related predictions. All the simulation work is supported by experimental work, to employ realistic data inputs and to validate models. Chraracterization efforts have been invaluable in achieving these goals. Also, the combined activities in processing, microstructural characterization, and simulation have made it possible to deal with micro-scale processes and to develop micro-scale products and nanocomposites. The following activities will be  supported by the Discovery Grant.

(1) Injection molding & film blowing: The main emphasis will be to consolidate and integrate the various components of software already developed by the group in these areas. More user-friendly interfaces will be implemented. New rheological constitutive models will be used.

(2) Micro-Injection Molding: The work on injection molding will be extended and adapted to micro-injection molding.  It will emphasize applications in MEMS, medical devices, and optical devices.  We shall include nanocomposites and biopolymers.

(3) Nanocomposites: We have developed  important tools for production of polymer/clay nanocomposites by melt compounding.  These include the development of  an efficient mixing system, the use of thermally stable surfactants, and the application of surface interactions in preparation and selection of organoclays. We also developed techniques for quantitative assessment of the extent of exfoliation.

(4) Laser welding: We plan to conduct studies leading to optimization of the microstructure of laser welded thermoplastic joints for maximum weld strength.

"Over the past 5 years, new evidence has been gathered regarding the very young Earth. It proves that our planet started to differentiate into metal, mantle and crust surprisingly soon after its final assembly. Although there is unanimous agreement about early differentiation, opinions range between two extreme viewpoints regarding the way in which the planet started to take shape.

    )	On the one extreme is the strict uniformitarian view, according to which the Earth's main geological processes of today pretty much operated 4.4 billion years ago. This concept, also known as the 'cool early Earth model', proposes that the familiar concept of plate tectonics was the main driving force behind planetary cooling. On the other extreme is the view that the early Earth was an inhospitable place whose atmosphere was filled with methane and whose surface was constantly covered in abundant mafic volcanic rocks, culminating in an event known as the late heavy meteorite bombardment. Here I identify several areas of research that will aim to provide new evidence to help resolve these conflicting views.

    )	First, we need to get a better handle on the age of the Moon because this will allow us to date the last step in the assembly of the Earth via the giant impact. My idea is to combine argon and lead isotope evidence to tease out a more precise minimum age of the Moon and the Earth.

    )	Second, we need to better understand how quickly metal cores formed on planetary precursors. There is a suite of meteorites (eucrites) that have been studied with hafnium-tungsten isotope systematics. The results are published but uncertainty about metal segregation time remains because we don't understand the geochemical behavior of tungsten well enough. This can be remedied with a study of modern mantle melts.

    )	Third, to everybody's surprise, some of the oldest zircon minerals on Earth were found to contain diamond inclusions. Is it possible that these diamonds formed when the early Earth was battered with meteorites, just as the Moon was? Or were these zircons formed deep in the Earth's interior? We need to know and we can study the Sudbury impact basin as an analogue for the early Earth.

"Semiconductor nanostructures are interesting from a standpoint of fundamental science and compelling for their promise in a wide variety of applications. These materials are in a size regime between molecules and bulk solids - the nanometer length scale. The novel aspect of nanoscience is that one can use size and geometry to tune the electronic and optical properties of these materials by virtue of physical confinement of the charge carriers. The availability of nanoscale structures opens up a wealth of new physics, chemistry, and materials science. 



The objective of this proposal is to investigate the dynamics and interactions of charge carriers in quantum confined semiconductor nanostructures. We will approach this central issue in nanoscience by performing state-of-the-art femtosecond laser spectroscopic to bring to light the richness of quantum confined materials. The specific aims of our research are: 1) To probe the physics of multiexcitons - a new state of matter, 2) To design efficient paths to optical gain using quantum dots, 3) To develop novel probes of quantum dots, 4) pulse shaping to control coherent quantum processes, and 5) Single dot blinking using novel two-color materials.  



The scientific outcome of this research program will be a clear picture of the features which govern the optical and electronic properties of semiconductor nanostructures. This understanding will be an enabling step towards rational implementation of these nanomaterials into new devices, e.g. solar cells, quantum dot lasers, efficient lighting, and ultimately quantum information. In parallel, this program will train HQP in key industrial areas of semiconductors, nanotechnology, and photonics.

"The semiconductor nanocrystal is one of the canonical material systems in the emerging revolutions in

nanoscience and nanotechnology. This remarkable material is a nanometer sized semiconductor which resides

in between the traditional disciplines of chemistry, physics, and engineering. By tuning the size of these

particles to the point in which quantum mechanical effects arise, one may be able to probe new science and

ultimately to develop next generation technologies. One area of technology in which quantum dots hold great

promise are in the development of white lighting. There has been much work investigating nanocrystal

quantum dot based LEDs using inefficient electrical injection of charges. Kambhampati's recent work on

quantum dots has revealed the physics underlying energy efficient optical amplification using quantum dots.

Mi's recent work has demonstrated efficient light emission from electrically driven quantum dot and nanowire

devices on silicon. Here, we will exploit these two research breakthroughs to yield novel hybrid devices for

greatly increased energy efficiency for white light sources.","Energy efficiency","Energy resources",Chemistry,"Kambhampati, Patanjali","I2IPJ ","Physical chemistry","Physical chemistry","Chimie physique","1 & 2-2"
"[Polygon search:] Robots can carry out intelligent tasks in an environment that is too hostile or boring to human beings, such as explosives disposal, undersea exploration and 24-hour surveillance. My research considers robots that search for moving objects (""intruders"") in a polygonal room, by illuminating them with one or more flashlights. Given a polygon, you would want to know how many robots with how many flashlights are required for searching the polygon, and if the number is determined, you want to plan their motion in an efficient way. The problem becomes more complex if there are obstacles in the polygon.  We assume that these obstacles are also of polygonal shape.



[VOD broadcasting:] Video-on-demand delivers requested videos to many users.  If a video is requested by a large number of users, then the server cannot keep with the demand. One way to cope with this problem is to broadcast popular videos, so that any number of users can download and view them without excessive delay. The amount of bandwidth required by video depends on the initial delay, sometimes called the play-out latency.  We want to design broadcasting schemes that minimize this bandwidth, and yet are easy to implement.

"Over the past 200 years, vaccination has been one of the most important medical interventions for preventing diseases that has been implemented on a wide scale. New vaccination strategies and new manufacturing technologies have broadened the vaccine market from traditionally pediatric population to a larger population including adults to target, for example, cancer and other chronic diseases. Amongst the vaccine candidates, Viral Like Particles (VLP) have shown great promises for the development of new class of vaccines. VLPs or empty shells of viruses devoid of any genetic material are not infectious and do not replicate, thereby representing a safer alternative than inactivated or attenuated virus-based vaccinations. Because of repeated motifs and surface antigen exposure, they also have an advantage over soluble antigen vaccinations. Safety and potency of vaccines are primary requirements, however to allow access to large population, especially in low-income countries, cost-effective manufacturing is of critical importance. Therefore, efficient production systems exploiting advances in recombinant DNA and cell culture technologies are highly needed. The baculovirus expression system using insect cell culture has been extensively and successfully used in our lab over the past 15 years to produce large quantities of recombinant proteins, but also complex viral structures such as adeno-associated viruses. We now have at hand a powerful insect-cell based expression system, generic tools and the appropriate facilities but above all, an established expertise. In order to build on our existing expertise, and for the purpose of advancing the science of VLP processing, and contributing to the global effort against infectious diseases we propose a research program which will focus on addressing the upstream and downstream limitations to the development of cost-effective and robust manufacturing processes for VLP-based vaccines. This project will have far-reaching consequences. It will lead to the development of an integrated and robust high yield process for Influenza-VLP-vaccine and will constitute a model that will be applicable to all VLP-based vaccines.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","G�nie chimique","Kamen, Amine","RGPIN ","Biochemical engineering","Chemical engineering","G�nie chimique",1-5

"Traditionally, healthcare has focused on short-term treatment of life threatening problems; reactive rather than proactive health management. However, thanks to numerous studies on the provision of healthcare budgets, we know that it would be much more efficient, cost effective and safer for patients, if we concentrated on prevention, early intervention and screening. To this end, we are developing a continuous wearable vital signs monitor that is now possible thanks to advances in materials science and microelectronics. Such systems collect and analyze in situ medical data, like electrocardiograms (ECGs), heart rate, respiration rate and blood pressure in order to detect dangerous anomalies. Wide deployment of these devices could lead to radical improvements in health for individuals without any discomfort or significant additional cost to them. However, given the high computing needs of such battery powered systems, a trade-off must be made between miniaturization and device lifetime. Current devices operate only a couple of days, which affects the usability significantly. We propose therefore to harvest the energy dissipated by the human bearer to stretch the lifetime of the device. In fact, a human is a significant source of power, both in the form of heat and movement, which can be a natural power source for wearable health monitoring devices. If such an energy reclamation system is used, the lifetime of wearable devices would be theoretically unlimited. Furthermore, another significant problem would be resolved - environmental impact of battery waste.","Information systems and technology","Information and communication services","Engineering Science, School of","Kaminska, Bozena","STPGP ","Electrical and electronic engineering","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",2-3
"The overall Aim of the proposed research is to develop an entire new generation microsystem embedded in a flexible material (polymer) as a 3D ultra low power or no-power structure containing new or adopted sensors, communication , processing, storage, and powering. 

The scientific and technological long-term research will aim at:

- Identify new concepts and issues that may strongly impact the new generation of Microsystems, their integration and specific components.

- Investigate new bio-micro-electromechanical and optical sensors (Bio-MEMS) - medical applications require dedicated detection of multifarious parameters.

- Research and develop the 3D integration technologies based on polymer materials.

- Develop robust techniques and technologies for active material based devices based on polymers (possible also ceramics and metals) and for surface functionalisation at the nano- and micro-scale in order to permit embedding of new functions into or onto a variety of structured surface. 

- Explore generic powering solutions following two tracks: low power functions and improvement of energy resources and management (integrated power sources).

- Develop dedicated wireless communication components and application models (demonstrators).

"The goal of my research program is to better understand factors affecting cell shape and function in eukaryotes, complex organisms that include both humans and fungi. Fungal impacts on humans and on ecology span beneficial and detrimental effects, ranging from recycling and biotechnology to pathogenesis of animals and plants. To better use or control fungal activities, we need improved knowledge of their growth, metabolism, and responses to external factors. Fungi have few cell types, simple cell structures, and short life cycles compared to animals, nevertheless, animal and fungal physiology and genetic controls are fundamentally similar. Experiments can be done easily and quickly in fungi, and the results can be applied to medical research. Analytical and molecular genetic tools developed for species such as the bread mold, Aspergillus nidulans, make filamentous fungi exemplary experimental model systems.

   My research uses complementary approaches to study A. nidulans cell biology, focusing on two areas:       )	

1) clarification of the roles of the secretory and cytoskeletal systems, which are required for cell growth, and 

2) high resolution structural and biochemical studies to develop better tools for understanding the relationship between cell form, function, and composition. My research group has characterized A. nidulans hypA and hypB, genes that control related but distinct secretory system pathways, and also coordinate cell growth and nuclear division. We use high-resolution confocal epifluorescence microscopy of growing cells to explore the dynamic roles of the cytoskeleton and the secretory system. We have developed new analytical tools, including synchrotron infrared spectromicroscopy for high spatial resolution biochemical profiling, and atomic force microscopy for high-resolution imaging of growing fungal hyphae, to study their responses to manipulation.

   In the coming funding cycle we will clarify relationships and cellular functions of secretory system genes, particularly regarding organelle dynamics. We will apply our bioanalytical tools to critical stages in the fungal life cycle, and to exploration of the biochemical consequences of fungal growth in diverse environments.

"Representation theory is the study of symmetries of objects.  For example, one studies all the possible ways that a ball can be rotated.  These sets of symmetries -- called Lie groups -- are of fundamental importance in many areas of mathematics, including number theory and mathematical physics.   The representation theory of Lie groups has been studied for many years, using algebraic, analytic, and combinatorial techniques.



In recent years, geometric techniques have started to be used in representation theory.  My research exploits these geometric techniques to try to solve open problems in the representation theory of Lie groups.  More specifically, I am using the geometric Langlands program, which is a geometrization of ideas from number theory.  Much like a high-powered microscope, using these powerful geometric techniques allows one to study fine structures in representation theory, such as canonical bases.

- To investigate the long term behavior of the solutions of the hyperbolic partial differential equations that govern the propagation of test classical fields in the space-time geometries of higher-dimensional rotating black holes, with the objective of proving rigorous stability results for initial data involving the superposition of infinitely many modes.



- To study the class of quasi-exactly and excatly solvable potentials which correspond to Schroedinger operators which are not Lie algebraic and arise from exceptional modules of higher codimension, in one or several variables.

"In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in developing and using large-scale integrated Transport and Land use Models (ITLUMs) to support the planning process in cities. Such models are complex simulation tools normally used to evaluate the long-term repercussions of proposed urban land-use and/or transport projects. To enhance the predictive ability of these models, recent thinking calls for adopting a micro approach that identifies individual persons, households, firms and developers as the units of analysis. The consensus seems to be that such an approach will lead to disaggregated (also known as microsimulation) models that are behaviorally sound and policy sensitive, capable of promoting sustainable practices in urban areas. In response to this paradigm, the proposed research will seek to develop an operational urban land use microsimulation model. The proposed development environment will be based on components from the ""ArcGIS"" Geographic Information System, which provides state-of-the-art development tools for maintaining and managing large spatial databases. The unified modeling language (UML) will facilitate the development of object-oriented geodatabase data models as part of the microsimulation models. The first stage of development will involve the creation of synthetic populations of households and business establishments for the study area. The second stage entails the design and development of an integrated framework that encompasses population demographic, firm demographic, land supply and land market modules. The first two modules will microsimulate changes in household structure, residential mobility, and with respect to firms, changes occurring in the spatial distribution of firms and jobs because of failure, establishment, growth/decline and relocation of firms in the city. The third module will simulate the land development process by type of land use, while the fourth will bring together supply and demand for land to simulate the land market. The novelty of the proposed research is the attempt to develop an operational and truly agent-based land use model that is comprehensive, robust, policy sensitive, easily expandable and transferable to other cities.

"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used to elucidate information about the 3-dimensional structural of important biological molecules, how their structure changes in time, and their interactions with other molecules, such as drugs. At the University of Toronto Mississauga, there are three researchers who use NMR spectroscopy to study medically important biological molecules. Their studies involve studies of complex macromolecular systems, which require significant access to high field NMR spectrometers. Currently, there is only one high field spectrometer (600 MHz) at UTM capable of biomolecular NMR experiments. Funds are requested for computer upgrades and associated software to render the second high field instrument, a 500 MHz spectrometer, capable of complicated biolomecular NMR experiments. We also request funding for an uninterruptable power supply (UPS) to protect against intermittent power failures, which could  severely damage the instrument and are problematic for acquiring biomolecular NMR experiments that normally take many hours or days, making a UPS necessary. By equipping the 500 MHz instrument for protein NMR studies, we can create an NMR center that better accommodates the needs of the NMR groups.

"The sulphonyl urea (SUR) protein family is a member of a large superfamily of membrane proteins found in all organisms. By utilizing the energy of ATP, known as the energy currency of the cell, these proteins bind compounds at the membrane and/or actively transport solutes into and out of the cell. Proper regulation of this process is essential, as many genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis and adrenoleukodystrophy, result from dysfunction of different proteins in this ubiquitous protein superfamily. SUR proteins are part of a large protein complex that functions as a potassium channel and use ATP to regulate opening and closing of the channel pore. Regulation of the protein that forms the channel pore (called Kir6.x) by the SURs is essential. Dysfunction of SUR proteins that affects their ability to use ATP, to adopt their cognate three-dimensional structure, and to interact with Kir6.x in the channel complex result in cardiovascular disorders and pancreatic diseases related to insulin production.



This proposal describes biochemical and biophysical experiments designed to gain insights into the molecular basis of normal potassium channel regulation by the SUR proteins and its impairment in prevalent human diseases. We will study interactions of individual protein segments in the SURs involved in relaying information from the utilization of ATP inside the cell to solute binding at the membrane, and also investigate protein motion during various points in the ATP reaction cycle. The proposed research will elucidate some of the complex mechanisms by which the SUR proteins are regulated and, ultimately, how they regulate the channel pore. Because SUR proteins are part of a large superfamily of proteins with common structural and mechanistic features, our studies of the SUR proteins will information about a class of proteins that are conserved throughout biology.

"The search for knowledge on the synthesis of elements that composed all matter on earth has been one of mankind's greatest quests.  Human life and all the matter in the world owe our roots to stardust. It is through cascade of reactions of nuclei in the core of stars that key elements such as carbon, oxygen, iron, calcium that are necessary for our survival, came into being. These nuclei, referred to as 'unstable nuclei', which have paved the path to our existence, are very short-lived objects existing only in high temperature environment in the cosmos. 

    To solve the puzzle on the origin of elements, it is however crucial to understand the properties of these unstable nuclei. Recently, we have found a way to produce and make reactions of these objects in our laboratories. This tool, termed as radioactive ion beam (RIB), has brought about a major revolution in science.  The reactions occurring in the stars can be studied for the first time in our laboratories with RIB. We will use the RIB at TRIUMF to unravel the mysteries of element synthesis.

    Unlike the species of nuclei that exist on our earth (i.e. stable nuclei) these unstable nuclei have unbalanced number of constituent particles called protons and neutrons which drive them to have very unusual properties. So far our knowledge was primarily built only on the study of stable nuclei. Some of our initial investigations have shown that the arrangement of the protons and neutrons, that make up a nucleus are dramatically changed inside these unstable nuclei in comparison to the stable nuclei.

    Our new investigation will contribute to form a new global view of nuclei going beyond the restricted knowledge we had so far studying only stable nuclei. We will investigate some of the key reactions that occur in cosmic objects like the supernovae to understand how element synthesis occurs. This fundamental research will thus contribute to enlighten our society about the objects and the paths that have led to the existence of matter on earth.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Astronomy and Physics","Kanungo, Rituparna","SAPIN ","Nuclear physics",Physics,Physique,3-3

"We are all familiar with the ways that the computer can be used to store, manipulate, and render text.  We take good type for granted: today, in a few minutes, we can format and print a document that surpasses in quality what would have required years of work at a printing press.  In the process we lose something of the artistry of hand printing, but we accept the trade-off because of the great benefits of efficient communication.



Typography is concerned with letters that are highly legible and consistent.  Good type is unobtrusive, almost invisible unless attended to; we should be able to ""see through"" the letters directly to the meaning.



However, not all text needs to be type.  There are many historical and modern examples of text that has been deformed, distorted, and downright deconstructed for the purposes of art.  Calligraphers turn fragments of text into inscriptions as beautiful as any painting.  With this kind of lettering, artistic goals such as balance and composition prevail; consistency is much less important, and even legibility may be forsaken.



In this project, I will use techniques from computer graphics to explore the calligraphic capabilities of the computer. I am interested in studying three specific styles of calligraphy:  ""representational calligraphy"", in which an inscription has been deformed into a recognizable shape; graffiti tags and murals; and Ambigrams, short inscriptions that look the same when turned upside-down.



I will create tools that give computer users, graphic design professionals, and artists the same expressive power with calligraphy that they currently enjoy with type.

"This proposal is concerned with the effect of

curvature bounds on the local geometric structure and global topology of

Riemannian manifolds with  various curvature bounds and the

structure of their Gromov-Hausdorff limits.

The principal investigator will continue to study



1. Structure of (almost) nonnegatively curved manifolds and collapsing with lower curvature bounds;



2. Fundamental groups of manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below;



3.Submetries of Alexandrov spaces and manifolds;



4. Structure of open negatively and nonpositively pinched manifolds.



 Comparison geometry plays an important role in understanding the  interplay between geometry and topology of Riemannian manifolds. This has recently been illustrated by the fact that it played an important role   in the purported resolution of Poincare conjecture by G.~Perelman.  We propose several new methods and directions of study which could lead to a greater insight about spaces with various curvature bounds.  This is important because curvature and Ricci curvature in particular plays a central role in mathematics and physics.

Spatial sound cues can add a better sense of ""presence"" or ""immersion"", can compensate for poor visual cues (graphics), and lead to improved object localization.  That being said, accurately recreating the potentially large number of interactions between a sound and the objects/surfaces it may encounter as the sound propagates through the environment while accounting for the human listener is extremely difficult and beyond our current analytical and computational reach, except perhaps for simple environments.  There is also a lack of established methodology for the detailed evaluation of the effectiveness and accuracy (e.g., how faithful the model is to the actual phenomena being modeled) of spatial sound systems in general.  Many evaluations involve making comparisons between various properties/statistics computed by the system and the corresponding theoretical/predicted values.  However, the human listener is the ultimate user of any spatial sound application and therefore, to determine the effectiveness of such systems, any method of evaluation must also include human listeners in order to account for human auditory perception.  This research program seeks to develop methods and techniques that will lead to more efficient, realistic simulations of dynamic, interactive, multi-modal virtual environments through the investigation of: i) the trade-off between accuracy vs. computational time; ii) whether human perception may be exploited to limit computational resources, and iii) the potential merger of human-based effects with acoustical modeling to facilitate efficient listener sound fields through the use of different algorithms and techniques.  The training of highly qualified personnel is an essential component of the proposed research program and will include the training of students.  While under my supervision, students will have the opportunity to work on unique, cutting edge research using state of the art facilities, while interacting and building ties with experts in acoustics.","Information and communication services","Information and communication services","Business and Information Technology, Faculty of","Kapralos, Bill","RGPIN ","Virtual reality and related simulations","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",2-5

"In order for a single cell to give rise to another, it must be able to replicate its genetic material, and then divide it equally into two independent daughter cells.  The last crucial step of this process - where the mother cell is physically separated into two distinct entities - is called cytokinesis.  Cytokinesis is achieved through the use of a ring-like structure that forms in the medial region of the cell. Upon receiving the proper signals, this ring constricts with such force that it is able to ""cleave"" the cell into two.  Interestingly, research has shown that cells are able to monitor the constriction of the ring, and furthermore that mechanisms are in place to help maintain the physical integrity of this structure. This system is used to promote the successful completion of cytokinesis even when cells are subjected to stresses that might perturb their normal function.  Broadly speaking, the research program concerns the genes and proteins required to ensure that the ring forms and constricts in a faithful and dependable manner.  Of current interest is a specific protein that promotes the successful completion of cytokinesis by influencing a critical cellular regulator that is involved in determining which genes in a cell are turned on or off.

    Importantly, the work of others has shown, at least in the case of the mouse, that cells resulting from aberrant cytokinesis (i.e. cells in which the ring has failed to constrict) are much more likely to accumulate errors in their genetic material, and thus have a higher probability of developing into cancerous tumours.  Although our work will be conducted with a relatively simple model organism - a unicellular yeast referred to as Schizosaccharomyces pombe - it is hoped that this research will provide a theoretical framework from which to study this phenomenon in more complex organisms such as humans.

"Network problems are among the most basic optimization problems. Whether the goods transfered through them are data or commodities they must be designed so as to optimize metrics such as time, costs, or revenue. It has been long known that although these networks may be very different, their modelling can capture their underlying common characteristics. A very recent manifestation of this trend (alongside the older examples of network flow, routing, fault tolerance etc.) is the introduction of selfish behaviour in the study of large data and communication networks such as the Internet; while this is a new paradigm for most computer scientists, it has been studied for more than 50 years by economists and the transportation community. The design of network protocols based on auction mechanism design is another such example. The purpose of this research is to explore the application of these new paradigms in network design from an algorithmic point of view, alongside the study of more `traditional' aspects such as the development, analysis and implementation of better approximation algorithms for network flow and routing problems. In a world that is more inter-connected than ever, the expectation of this research proposal is to have a significant impact on the more efficient distribution of information, goods, services etc.

"Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are solid-state energy conversion devices that have immense potential as cleaner, high-efficiency distributed power systems. SOFCs offer several advantages: combined heat and power efficiency up to 75-80%, fuel flexibility by allowing usage of conventional fuels (e.g. natural gas and diesel) and alternative fuels (e.g. bio-ethanol and biogas), and ability to be scaled from micro-watts to hundreds of kilowatts. To realize the full potential of this promising technology, one of the key barriers to commercialization - high cost - must be overcome. This can be attained by designing high performance SOFCs. 

The proposed research is focused on  improving the performance of one of the key sub-components of an SOFC - the cathode. The cathode processes in an SOFC are the dominant cause for poor overall cell performance. The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop a predictive, reliable computational modeling tool that can be applied for designing high performance SOFCs. This goal will be realized in a combined experimental/modeling research program over 5 years through the requested NSERc Discovery Grant. The experimental component of the research will generate accurate electrochemical data which will then be input into the micro-model of the porous cathode. Ultimately, the model will then be utilized to optimize the microscopic features/design of the porous cathode such that maximum electrochemical performance is attained. This will allow design of a higher performance and, thereby, an affordable SOFC. Widespread adoption of SOFC - a cleaner and more efficient energy conversion device - translates into less emission of pollutants and greenhouse gases per kilowatt energy used. Realizing the goals of the proposed research will help us maintain a high quality of life in Canada, maintain the Canadian edge in the technology, and benefit the economy.

"One can hardly pick up a magazine or newspaper these days without reading a story about nano-science, nano-technology or on the impact of ""materials science and technology"" on society.  In addition to the popular press, new scientific journals and international technical conferences with nano- as a prefix are being launched constantly.  Furthermore governments, universities and other research institutions in the US, Europe and Asia are investing heavily on research in nano-related areas.  As for industry, highly respected organizations such as the National Science Foundation in the US and the 7th European Research Framework estimate that future markets in nano-related areas will reach (within a decade) ""a trillion dollars"".  All of these make nano an obvious opportunity.  What is not made so obvious (especially in the popular press) is that nano also represents a major research challenge.  For example, as the total amount of material (or sample) available for analysis becomes progressively smaller (e.g., from micro- to nano-) and as the concentrations of impurities that must be determined in such tiny amounts of sample are continuously lowered (e.g., due to requirements for higher purity materials needed to advance nano-science and -technology), the ability to measure lower concentrations of impurities in progressively smaller amounts of sample becomes a daunting analytical challenge.   



    The goals of proposed work are to discover new knowledge that can be applied to development of methods and instrumentation that will help meet this challenge; and to invent miniaturized instrumentation that will reduce the cost of analysis, thus making micro and especially nano elemental analysis more widely available.  

    Proposed work will create exceptional opportunities for discovery and knowledge-generation; for innovation, invention and wealth generation; and importantly, for training of highly qualified personnel.  The high-tech skills and knowledge obtained by those involved in proposed research will put them in a leading position to compete with their peers from any major academic, government and industrial lab worldwide.

"The number and usage of different management system standards are growing among organizations in Canada and worldwide. Therefore, the need for research on the methods for their effective and efficient application through integration, presented in this proposal, is evident. Apart from the tremendously-pervasive standards for quality (ISO 9001) and environmental (ISO 14001) management, which are currently used by at least one million organizations, there are numerous other standards of identical nature and similar potential impact. They are and will be applied by organizations to address the assurance needs of their various stakeholders in areas such as customer satisfaction codes of conduct application (ISO 10001), complaint handling (ISO 10002), internal auditing (ISO 19011), and information security (ISO 27001). The development of standards covering not only the overall management systems, such as the one for quality management, but also their specific components, for example, complaint handling, can be expected to increase in the future. This research seeks a solution that capitalizes on the opportunity to use all or any of these standards in an organization. Namely, it aims to provide a comprehensive framework for the integration of standardized management systems. Auditing and other alike methodologies for management system augmentation are specifically focused on. Enabling organizations to establish, maintain and improve integrated management systems based on and including multiple standards is the ultimate goal and the expected result of the research. Furthermore, this work will facilitate management system standardization at national and international levels, and strengthen a leading position currently held in the research on the integration of standardized management systems.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Mechanical Engineering","Karapetrovic, Stanislav","RGPIN ","Industrial engineering","Industrial engineering","G�nie industriel",1-5

"The concept of a universal object is very important in mathematics. It appears in algebra, analysis, geometry, and topology. What does it mean for an object X to be universal for a certain family of objects? One standard requirement is that X is an element of the family itself. Other requirements may vary. Nevertheless, the general idea is that X must contain in itself a copy of each object from the family, or each object from the family can be obtained from X by means of a certain standard procedure. I study universal objects for various versions of dimensions. One of my main goals is to find out whether a universal compactum exists in the case of cohomological dimension. To solve this problem, I intend to apply methods of extension dimension, and, in particular, further develop the theory of quasi-finite complexes that I have introduced. Another part of my program is concerned with infinite-dimensional topology. Infinite-dimensional spaces are important in many applications of mathematics. For example, Hilbert space is an essential ingredient of quantum mechanics. I study various classes of infinite-dimensional spaces. I wish to find ""nice"" characterizations for these classes to better understand the structure of spaces. The third part of my proposal is devoted to spans of continua. The simplest example of a continuum is a metric graph, which can be visualized as a network of roads. The span of such graph can be described as the maximal distance two travellers can keep between each other while simultaneously traversing the graph. I am going to investigate properties of span, such as relations between types of spans. I also want to find out whether continua with span zero are similar to a line segment. The concluding part of my program is devoted to the study of various analogs between commutative and non-commutative topology. By studying properties of algebras of functions and their connection to the properties of underlying spaces I hope to discover new properties of C*-algebras.","Mathematical sciences","Advancement of knowledge",Mathematics,"Karassev, Alexandre","RGPIN ","Set theory and general topology","Pure mathematics","Math�matiques pures",1-5
"Buildings account for about 30% of Canada's energy consumption, about 50% of its electricity consumption and roughly 28% of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Sustainable technologies present potential to reduce these energy flows, mitigate GHG emissions while enhancing indoor environmental quality. Natural and hybrid ventilation as well as implementation of innovative building-integrated solar energy utilization systems represent an area of significant interest and untapped potential in sustainable building design - both for residential and office buildings. Cost-effective integration of sustainable technologies in buildings requires detailed modelling of wind effects as they are directly related to their performance and wind load design. These innovative components, which replace conventional cladding, have not yet found their way into wind load design standards and they present further challenges for wind and structural engineers. The proposed research program is original in that it considers wind effects on buildings due to modern technologies. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to develop research-based innovative engineering approaches and efficient design techniques to achieve optimal integration of sustainable technologies in buildings. The main focus is to evaluate the impact of natural ventilation and roof-integrated photovoltaic systems on wind load design of cladding and structural systems. The proposed research program will involve boundary layer wind tunnel testing, full-scale monitoring, as well as computational methods. It is anticipated that the proposed research program will promote the climate change related research in Canada and it will be a necessary step towards the reduction in CO2 emissions and the development of a sustainable built environment. The proposed research will significantly contribute towards the development of standards for low-energy cooling techniques (i.e. natural ventilation) and wind-load provisions for roof-mounted PV-systems in building codes and design standards.","Structural engineering","Construction, urban and rural planning","Civil and Environmental Engineering","Karava, Panagiota","RGPIN ","Civil engineering","Civil engineering","G�nie civil",2-5

"The applicant has undertaken a research program aimed at investigating innovative biocatalytic approaches toward the development of functional ingredients and nutraceuticals. In the short term, the primary focus of the applicant's program is on the development of novel enzymatic glycosylation strategies for efficient synthesis of non-digestible oligosaccharides whose benefits, in supporting intestinal health and reducing the risk of cancers, are being increasingly recognized. Novel fructooligosaccharides (FOSs), headed with different pentoses or polyols instead of a glucosyl moiety, have been identified as potential candidates. These novel FOSs may conceivably possess new immunomodulatory capacity and antiadhesive activity against pathogens that are not present in the current FOS generation. Although levansucrases (LSs) are being increasingly recognized for their potential to catalyze the synthesis of novel FOSs, their availability and their operational stability are still limited. Initial efforts have been focused on the induction and the recovery of novel LSs from thermophilic microbial sources. To provide a rational basis for a better modulation of the actions of LSs, an important part of the proposed research work will rely on the investigation of the mechanism by which these enzymes function. The driving forces that control the thermodynamic equilibrium of LS-catalyzed transfructosylation will also be studied for a greater yield synthesis of well-defined FOSs. With the aim of enabling easy modulation of the transfructosylation processes, the immobilization of LSs on nanomaterial supports will be studied, emphasizing the relationships between the features of nanomaterials and the efficiency of LSs. The rational combination of immobilization and molecular imprinting will be further explored to improve the LS selectivity. The produced FOSs will be characterized in terms of their structures and their biological activities. The requested Refractometer detector is key to this program and will be coupled with the HPLC system purchased through the awarded CIF-LOF grant. This detector equipment is needed for the quantitative analysis of the transfructosylation products as well as for their purification for further structural analyses by NMR and FTIR.

"Einstein's theory of general relativity describes gravitational forces between large objects, such as attraction between the Earth and the Sun that holds the Earth in its orbit around the Sun, and those forces determining the rate of expansion of the Universe since the Big Bang.  General relativity is an accurate theory and its predictions have been tested by experiment and observation.



Quantum Mechanics, on the other hand, is the theory of the small: the atom, as well as the atom's constituents.  It governs everything from superconductivity to the speed of chemical reactions, from commonplace electrons to exotic top quarks.  Quantum theory predicts experimental results to an unprecedented accuracy.



Relativity and Quantum Mechanics form two separate paradigms through which we describe our Universe.  Yet, the study of some fascinating objects and phenomena requires physicists to use both at once (black holes are an example of this).  String Theory is currently our best candidate for a framework in which these two theories can be brought together.  It has some profound consequences for what we think might be possible in our Universe, such as existence of extra dimensions.



Recent advances in String Theory contain many hints that space and time are not fundamental.  My work focuses on learning new things about the nature and origin of space-time when viewed from up close, and the objects which might be more fundamental than space-time itself.

"In the same way we use letters of the alphabet to write text, and bits 0 and 1 to write computer machine code, the four basic DNA units(adenine,guanine,cytosine,thymine) are used by Nature to write genetic information as DNA strands. The possibility of encoding symbolic information on DNA, and the fact that biochemical processes such as cut-and-paste of DNA strands can be used to perform arithmetic and logic operations,led to the development of the field of DNA computing. The primary goal of my research is to analyze this new way of storing and manipulating data on DNA strands. Indeed, bioinformation and biocomputation are different from their electronic  counterparts in several aspects. First, biodata is not associated to a memory location but consists of infinitesimal DNA strands free-floating in solution. Second, in contrast to the electronic computer, data-encoding DNA strands can interact with each other in un-programmed ways. Third, each data encoding DNA strand is usually present in  millions of identical copies and the bio-operations operate according to statistical laws. 



This proposal addresses a) the issue of data encoding on DNA by studying  properties that ensure that biocomputations proceed error-free, and  b) lies the foundation of a ""theory of bioinformation"" by studying the algebraic properties of the new concepts defined in a). Another of the proposed research topics is  an investigation into the mathematical properties of genomic bioinformation by  i)  exploring the use of Chaos Game Representation as a  genomic signature, and ii) searching for the optimal tool to measure the complexity of genomes, both of which could lead to methods of quantifying and comparing genomes of various organisms. The last aspect of the proposed research is an exploration in the theory of self-assembly of small components into complex structures as a computational tool, which  could provide insights in the way nature stores and processes information, as well as have implications for   nanoscience and nanotechnology.

"My research program is in differential geometry, an area of pure mathematics which studies the existence and properties of certain kinds of geometric shapes in high dimensions. Current theories of physics for very small distances and large energies (superstring theory and supergravity) require for their description some geometric shapes of dimensions 7 and 8, possessing special properties related to their curvature. These objects have also been of independent mathematical interest, because they are closely related to some strange exceptions that arise in algebra. The goal is to study the possible types of geometric shapes that can exist with these special curvature properties. This will contribute to a better understanding of the physical theories and the beautiful mathematics which is needed to describe them.

"New x-ray radiographic systems based on amorphous silicon digital flat panel technology have revolutionized our capability of producing digital x-ray radiographic images. Amorphous selenium direct-detection X-ray detectors used in these systems provide the best spatial resolution and are predominantly used in the mammography market However, the selenium detector is coupled to an amorphous silicon pixel readout circuit which is inherentty noisy, therefore there is a trade-off between fine image detail and image contrast for low dose, real-time applications. The goal of this research project is to develop a digital imager that provides higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in fast frame rate applications while preserving fine image detail, for example, in 3D diagnostic imaging of breast cancer (mammography tomosynthesis). The primary benefits of improving digrtal X-ray imaging technology include reduction of diagnostic error and better detection of cancer. In addition, a reduction in radiation dose, while maintaining or enhancing detector performance, is an important competitive advantage. The results of this research are expected to help realize a mammography tomosynthesis product in the 5*10 year time rrame that will directly benefit the Canadian economy. The research will also involve the training of future scientists and engineers in the photonics, manufacturing, and information technology industries. Such highly skilled personnel are essential to maintain Canada's technological advantage internationally.

"Karim  Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. In the current era of screening mammography, most women are diagnosed with localized, early stage disease for which treatment will include breast-conserving surgery followed by breast external beam radiotherapy (XRT). Compared to XRT, recent work in Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) techniques such as high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, show a dramatic reduction of radiation induced acute skin reactions and a reduction of the overall treatment time by delivering a higher dose per fraction to a reduced volume of breast tissue. In contrast to HDR brachytherapy that requires treatment of the patient for five days, a novel technique was recently developed at Sunnybrook where a permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) using 103-Palladium is administered under local anesthesia in a single one-hour session allowing patients to be discharged the same day. The goals here are to enable effective treatment of breast cancer by ensuring the accurate placement of seeds during surgery and evaluating the seed dose distribution during and at the end of the implantation by guiding the seed implantation and allowing for correction of a less than optimal implant while the patient is still in the operating room and anesthetized. The objective of this research is to develop a selective, photon counting, solid state, semiconductor based gamma-camera dedicated to imaging of low-energy (20 keV) isotopes of 103-Palladium to provide clear visualization and dose distribution of radioactive seeds during the implantation procedure and thus improve state-of-the-art for current breast cancer therapy.

"The overall objective of the proposed research is to advance large area active matrix flat panel detector (FPD) technology to enable emerging low photon fluence, real-time, large area, biomedical imaging applications such as 3D screening mammography tomosynthesis , protein crystallography, X-ray diffraction and scatter imaging.  This will be accomplished by improving upon radiation detectors from a circuit, device and process level while using industry standard fabrication processes. The primary benefits of using the proposed approach is to leverage the capabilities of the well-established active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) fabrication infrastructure and the mature silicon circuit design techniques developed over the past three decades.  In this research, we address the key bottlenecks to the widespread adoption of FPD technology: dynamic range, spatial resolution and cost.  

The significant industrial activity associated with digital medical X-ray imaging today serves to underscore the critical nature of the technology.  Canada has a strong presence in the medical FPD market - one major international FPD supplier, ANRAD, is headquartered in Quebec while another, Imaging Dynamics is based out of Alberta.  DALSA Imaging Corporation, based in Waterloo, is a world leader in machine vision while Redlen Corporation from Vancouver, British Columbia is applying its Cadmium Zinc Telluride detector for biomedical imaging.  The proposed research seeks to train and attract the talented individuals necessary for this sector and the associated Canadian companies to flourish.

"It is widely recognized that drinking water ought to be free from disease-causing organisms, objectionable odours, turbidity, and any colours resulting from the dissolved substances.  Some of the major sources of drinking water, namely surface water and groundwater, contain substances that cause offensive odours. Some of these odours have been commonly associated with the presence of low-oxidation state sulphur compounds in water. Sulphides and polysulphides are examples of such low-oxidation state sulphur compounds. Organic sulphur compounds such as trimethylsulphide are known as significant contributors to the offensive odours in water. These sulphur species with low oxidation states are produced during a variety of biotic and abiotic processes including the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide and sulphide minerals, sulfate reduction, and the transformation of organic sulphur compounds. 

My short term-goals include the characterization of these compounds in drinking-water sources. In particular, part of the proposed study will be aimed at examining whether any of the low-oxidation state ionic compounds of sulphur are responsible for the formation of the organic sulphides found in water. One of my long-term goals is to perform a mechanistic-approach study aimed at an understanding of how these reduced sulphur compounds form. My other long-term goal is geared towards providing useful practical steps necessary in the removal of offensive odours from water sources having such problems. Currently this is in part carried out through chlorination, which is primarily intended for removal of harmful microbes from our drinking water. The down side of chlorination is that any residual chlorine has the potential of reacting with some dissolved organic matter to produce trihalomethanes which are carcinogen-suspects.  I will investigate whether other oxidizing agents are suitable for removing the objectionable odours from our drinking waters. This study is expected to significantly contribute towards the understanding of the processes that cause offensive odours in water and to the development of effective and environmentally-friendly means of dealing with these odours.",Water,"Transportation systems and services",Biology,"Kariuki, Stephen","RGPIN ","Analytical chemistry","Analytical chemistry","Chimie analytique",3-5

"Important technological advances will be made in communications and networks. The focus will be on mobile and wireless connectivity, known as third generation (3G and coming 4G) mobile telecommunications systems, and to a certain extent on ad hoc networks. As a result we will be surrounded by ever growing multi-domain (technical and administrative) heterogeneous communications in both wired and wireless networks. This environment deals with communication in ""multi-zoned networks"", where people, devices, appliances and servers are connected to each other via different kinds of networks. Networks will be pervasive, ubiquitous, multi-service, multi-operator and multi-access.

This project aims at developing an autonomic service specific overlay network architecture, models, and algorithms for enabling seamless service delivery across dynamic fixed and mobile networks. This can be achieved by developing a framework for supporting adaptive service delivery that optimizes utilization of network resources in self-managed adaptive service overlay infrastructure.

"Water supply and distribution systems form an essential part of modern infrastructure and of the economies of both cities and nations, being the foundation of a healthy society and industrial base.  These systems represent an estimated investment of $6 billion per million of population.  The systems not only deteriorate over time, but are subject to random loads including pipe breaks, emergency actions, power failures and the effects of climate.  Deteriorated systems are common and wasteful of both water and energy. This proposal focuses on unsteady flow conditions but seeks an integrated and holistic assessment of system performance.   Transient pressures can be large and destructive, quite capable of breaking pipes, damaging equipment, or of causing dangerous water quality events. The possible threat to water quality has been given more attention lately since a sudden low pressure wave could cause backflow of contaminated water at certain appliances or sprinkler systems, or even intrusion of potentially contaminated water through leaks.

      The thrust of this research is threefold. First, a more comprehensive range of conditions, capitalizing on our considerable field experience and our growing connections with Canadian consultants and municipalities, is attempted.  The goal is to be comprehensive in analysis of actual field conditions and meticulous in both assessment and system representation. This work will include inverse transient analysis and use the full range of modern sensors, recording equipment and analysis approaches. Second, the work will not only diagnose unsteady flow problems, but will compare available mitigation procedures using a comprehensive set of metrics including system reliability, robustness, resilience and vulnerability. Finally, to create an overall decision support system, an explicitly multi-objective framework will be developed. Too often past solutions have addressed too narrow a range of system performance, thus possibly improving, say, system reliability to surge, at the cost of greater vulnerability to, say, water quality disturbances.  If the water distribution systems that are so critical to our health and economy is to be taken seriously, we can and must do a better job.",Water,"Transportation systems and services","Civil Engineering","Karney, Bryan","RGPIN ","Hydraulic engineering","Civil engineering","G�nie civil",2-5

"Progress witnessed in medicine and health care over the past decades has increased life expectancy but has led to an aging society, a good portion of which involves elderly and disabled individuals who are in dire need for direct physical assistance and day to day care. This has induced skyrocketing costs associated with the services and care provided to them. We explore in this proposal an alternative to minimize some of these costs and to alleviate the burden on the health care providers by developing a class of intelligent machines termed as cognitive assistive robotic systems, the main task of which is to support and provide basic needs and assistance for an elderly/disabled individual. To impart natural interaction capabilities with humans, these systems need to have cognitive features allowing them to recognize to a certain extent human intentions, to predict human behavior under certain circumstances and to respond adequately to some basic requests made by the human user. The robotic system designed should be able to store knowledge and to learn useful skills from humans. Development of an assistive robotic system in which the intelligence is not entirely hand-coded requires extensive exploitation of existing advanced robotics and mechatronics technologies and the development of new types of algorithms and human-machine interactions systems allowing for seamless and almost-natural interaction with humans where perception, reasoning, and action planning capabilities are key factors. To deal with such challenges and to fulfill the goal of designing a cognitive assistive robotic system, the proposed research integrates within a flexible framework a number of modules involving machine attention, natural man-machine interaction, behavioral and incremental learning and action planning. These are all fields pertinent to the applicant's expertise. The proposal tackles a number of issues in the maturing and evolving field of cognitive assistive robotics. It should lead to excellent opportunities for the advancement of knowledge in this field, the training of highly qualified personnel and could also potentially lead to commercially viable alternatives in the field of service robotics (of assistive nature) whether for hospital or home use.

"This research program aims at developing game theoretic models for oligopolies where competitive interactions exist between firms operating in a channel. This research program will help identify optimal firms' decisions in different rivalry situations and understand how these decisions are affected by various market and industry conditions. In particular, the results of this research will provide manufacturers and retailers with a better understanding of how their advertising and promotional decisions do affect their payoffs and those of their competitors. Our methodology will be analytical and will consist in developing static and dynamic game theoretic models that represent different scenarios of competition where the effects on payoffs of non-price decision variables are modeled. Game theory allows us to study decisions of distribution channels' members using a system approach. It provides equilibrium solutions for the decisions of several institutions (e.g., retailers and manufacturers) that have interdependent interests but at the same time do maximize their payoffs opportunistically. For most studied situations, non-cooperative games will be considered and Nash and Stackelberg equilibria will be computed. For dynamic games, preference will be for closed-loop and feedback information structures that provide subgame perfect solutions. Our methodology will also involve sensitivity analysis of the obtained equilibria to see how the different model's parameters affect optimal decision strategies. When appropriate, payoffs and equilibria from different scenarios will also be compared to study the effects created by competition. Finally, numerical simulations of the models' parameters will also be conducted to illustrate the sensitivity analysis, the path or the trajectory of the obtained equilibrium strategies.

This research program will provide useful answers to institutions operating in distribution channels on how to manage their optimal pricing and non-pricing strategies when facing competition from other institutions that are at the same time suppliers or customers. It will also be helpful to governmental agencies to assess the effects of competition on the market dynamics and consumers' demand and prices.","Production and operations management","Manufacturing processes and products","Business and Information Technology, Faculty of","Karray, Salma","RGPIN ","Operations research and management science","Industrial engineering","G�nie industriel",3-5
"Johne's disease (JD) is a widespread and economically important chronic inflammatory disease ofthe small intestine of ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). The prevalence of JD in Canada is estimated to be between 10 and 40% in dairy herds, which accounts for nearly 15 million dollars to the dairy industry, alone. Differences in the susceptibility to MAP infection appear to exist amongst dairy breeds, with Jerseys being more susceptible than the Holstein breed. In humans, a potential link between MAP exposure and Crohn's disease suggests that this pathogen also appears an impOltant food safety concern. Therefore, it is important that the dairy industry develops strategies for reducing the incidence of MAP infections in dairy cattle, and genetic selection might be one such approach. In order to do this, we are

proposing to identify candidate genes associated with MAP resistance/susceptibility by carrying out in vivo MAP challenge studies using dairy calves. Candidate genes will be identified using microarray analysis and whole genome methylation sensitive DNA fingerprinting to compare gene expression profiles and DNA methylation patterns, respectively, between the Jersey and Holstein breeds. The differentially expressed genes will be investigated further for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and unique DNA methylation polymorphisms; both types of polymorphisms contribute to heritable differences in gene expression among animals.",Agriculture,"Advancement of knowledge","Animal and Poultry Science","Karrow, Niel","CRDPJ ","Genome analysis",Genetics,"G�n�tique",1-3
"During pathogenic infections, glucocorticoids (GC) play a key role in maintaining physiological homeostasis in livestock, in part, by regulating the inflammatory and immune response. Circulating GC concentrations are therefore, tightly regulated by positive and negative signals from the immune system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA). It is suspected that disruption of these bi-directional communication pathways, or their dysfunction, may contribute to aetiology of certain diseases in livestock, and that environmental and genetic factors likely contribute to this process. This may be particularly relevant during early-life development, since studies using rodent models have demonstrated that disrupted genetic programming of the HPAA can permanently alter HPAA and immune responsiveness later in life. 

  The proposed research will study the genetic regulation of disease resistance in ruminants that is specifically mediated by communication between the HPAA and the immune system as a means of improving animal health and welfare. This research will 1) confirm that variation in the cortisol response (CR) to bacterial endotoxin is determined by signalling within the HPAA using high (HCR), middle (MCR), and low cortisol (LCR) responding lines of sheep, 2) confirm previously noted associations between CR and the cutaneous immune response using the HCR, MCR, and LCR lines of sheep, 3) identify genes and their polymorphisms, DNA methylation patterns, and protein isoforms that may contribute to variation in the CR phenotype, 4) determine if variable CR influences ageing of the immune system (immunosenescence) and susceptibility to inflammatory disease, and 5) identify genes that are susceptible to endotoxin-induced epigenetic programming during fetal development, and assess the contribution of epigenetic programming to susceptibility to inflammatory disease. It is anticipated that the identification of novel genes, gene polymorphisms, and enhanced understanding of gene by environment interaction during early-life development will contribute to improving animal health and food quality, reduce our dependence on antibiotics in agriculture, and enhance our understanding of the pathways that regulate the neuroendocrine-immune axis in mammalian systems.

"Symplectic geometry started out as the geometry underlying Hamilton's equations in classical mechanics. Similar structures appear in Lie theory (the study of continuous symmetries), algebraic geometry (shapes cut out by polynomial equations), quantum (rather than classical) mechanics, and in many more mathematical and physical contexts. Today, symplectic geometry has evolved into a deep mathematical field on its own right.  The field is exceptionally broad and interacts with many parts of mathematics and physics; it has gone through rapid developments in the last couple of decades and is an exciting front of international research.



Karshon's research focuses on aspects of symplectic geometry that involve symmetries.  A ""baby example"" is the two dimensional sphere with its rotational symmetry.  A higher dimensional example is the complex projective plane; symplectically, this can be viewed as a four dimensional ball with an attached two dimensional ""sphere at infinity"". Following Felix Klein's 1872 ""Erlanger programm"", there is great benefit in studying a geometry through its group of symmetries.  The full symmetry group of a symplectic space is always infinite dimensional; however, for many important spaces (such as the two-sphere or the complex projective plane), inside this infinite dimensional group one can find compact finite dimensional subgroups.  Karshon's research programme involves the study of symplectic spaces through these finite dimensional symmetries.



Current projects involve new classification schemes, recovering symmetries from their underlying ""quotient diffeology"", and relations with geometric quantization.

"The Internet has enabled an unprecedented adoption of new communication services and revolutionized both personal and business relationships and interaction patterns. Most of the core technological foundations and principles of the Internet network and transport layers were designed during the 1970s and 1980s, with only a few crucial components having been added since  then. Significant technical progress has improved the internals of packet delivery and increased the diversity of application services, but not fundamentally changed the way the Internet operates overall. Numerous research proposals have described advanced communication mechanisms, but very few such proposals have been deployed in the network infrastructure. In the research community, it is largely undisputed that the current Internet architecture has reached inherent functional limits for supporting advanced communication scenarios. This research program investigates core principles and mechanisms of any communication internetwork. It covers the full spectrum of related research questions, ranging from basic principles and algorithms to network stack implementations in operating systems.

"This research focuses on two intimately related issues, 'biological matter' and 'biomaterials'. The former may be understood as molecules, materials and structures present in living matter, for example, lipids, proteins, membranes, and DNA, in their natural environment. The latter term 'biomaterials' refers to man-made or designed materials that use organic/biological molecules or structures as building blocks, or their principles of operation.



The goals of this project are the following: first, to understand the fundamental processes in mineral formation in living matter, referred to as biomineralization. By understanding how nature makes minerals would give us the knowledge how to build new smart and adaptable materials having applications from medicine to electronics. Second, we aim to understand the dynamics and phenomena controlling lipid rafts, which are vital for intercellular signaling and functioning of many proteins. Finally, we focus on metallic nanoparticles to utilize (laser) light-induced forces in self-assembly and functionalization of materials. All of the above are linked together and their

simultaneous application leads to structures such as switchable membranes by utilizing metallic nanoparticles and ligand-functionalized surfaces.

"The notion of sheaves on fans originates in algebraic geometry as a combinatorial description of equivariant cohomology of toric varieties. The main application of the theory is in combinatorics -- prooving non-negativity of various combinatorially defined numbers. To mention a couple, non-negativity of the g-vector (the Hard Lefschetz theorem) and non-negativity of the cd-index. This proposal is to study the theory of sheaves on fans and posets with applications in two areas of combinatorics -- the Charney-Davis conjecture and the non-homogeneous cd-index of Bruhat graphs constructed by Billera and Brenti.



The Charney-Davis conjecture states that the alternating sum of the h-numbers of a flag fan has the correct sign depending on the dimension. It is well-known that non-negativity of the cd-index implies Charney-Davis conjecture for barycentric subdivisions of fans. One approach to the conjecture is to adapt the non-negativity proof for cd-indices to the case of general flag fans. This approach involves the theory of sheaves, mostly in the form of various duality theories on the category of sheaves, but also leads to problems in algebraic geometry, such as properties of the moduli space of sheaves on a fan.



It is known that an interval in the Bruhat order of a Coxeter group is Gorenstein*, hence there is a homogeneous cd-polynomial with non-negative coefficients associated with it. Billera and Brenti have generalized the homogeneous cd-polynomial to a non-homogeneous one that takes into account the longer edges in the Bruhat graph. They conjectured that this polynomial has non-negative coefficients. It is the second goal of this research to study this complete cd-index and prove its non-negativity.

"Ultra wideband (UWB) is a new and emerging short range device technology with potential benefits for wireless communications, radars, localization and security applications. UWB has potential in both home and business markets, based on its low cost as well as high speed data transmission capability, and is well suited for various high resolution video distribution applications. UWB radars find applications in medical imaging, target localization, fluid level measurement on transport vehicles, and through-wall probing. Apart from these applications, UWB technology will find applications in various surveillance applications. UWB systems are characterized by a wide system bandwidth and a low radiated power spectral density. It operates by exchange of short electromagnetic pulses between transmitter and receiver. Therefore it is very important to understand the pulse transmission, propagation and reception by UWB terminals for optimal system design. 

    )	A key component of the proposed research is the design and development of components  and subsystems for UWB wireless and radar applications. To expeditiously facilitate the experimental component of our research, we propose to build a general-purpose time domain characterization measurement system that will be used by four faculty members and their graduate students at our microwave research lab. The system will be able to accommodate various types of measurements and experiments, such as full characterization and pulse measurement of an UWB radar system for different pulse excitations.

"Ultra wideband (UWB) is a new and emerging short range device technology with potential benefits for wireless communications, radars, localization and security applications. UWB communication devices can be used in wirelessly distributed services such as phone, cable, and computer networking throughout a building or a home. UWB has potential in both home and business markets, based on its low cost as well as high speed data transmission capability, and is well suited for various high resolution video distribution applications. UWB radars find applications in medical imaging and through wall probing. UWB technology has the capability for object discrimination and characterization; hence it is suitable for developing safety devices for power tools. UWB technology could help in determining the water and salt content in concrete structures, historic buildings and bridges for evaluating the life span of the structures. Apart from these applications, UWB technology will find applications in various surveillance applications.

What ever the application it might be, the essential part of the technology is design and development of a transmitter and receiver for exchange of UWB pulses. Therefore it is very important to understand the pulse transmission, propagation and reception by UWB terminals for optimal system design. More- over in radar applications the target can be characterized by studying the reflected wave shape of the UWB pulse due to the target. Fundamentally pulse radiation is different from narrowband signals. Hence understanding the pulse radiation, effect of antenna on pulse shape, and pulse shaping by channel are high priority goals for UWB technology developers.

The main and overall objective of this research is developing a general frame work to establish the relation between transmitted and received UWB pulses for its pulse shape, width and amplitude. This objective will be met by successful comparison of the estimated and measured pulses.

"The main objective of my proposed research program is to investigate statistical estimation with minimum distance techniques. Roughly speaking, minimum distance estimators are parameter estimates chosen to minimize a distance between the data and the fitted model. It has been observed that minimum distance estimators are automatically robust, which makes them appealing in practice. Several minimum distance estimators for various models have been considered in the literature, primarily based on distribution functions. In general, different distances produce estimators that are consistent and asymptotically normal. Computational feasibility is an important factor for any estimation procedure. In most cases, the ease of computing depends on the choice of the distance and whether the model is parametric or semi-parametric in nature.



Estimating parameters using the quadratic distance measure is the easiest, and most of the published results have focused on this problem. A more advanced distance measure that produces robust and efficient estimators is the density-based Hellinger distance measure. However, the usefulness of the preceding method is hampered by its intensive computation. This problem is more severe in semi-parametric settings than in parametric models due in large part to the fact that the minimum Hellinger distance estimation approach may require the minimization of a non-differentiable function. Clearly, it is of theoretical and practical interest to have a data-driven distance method that has computational expediency, robustness and high statistical efficiency. My research program will include investigation of the ""one-step"" approach to minimum distance estimation methods as a simple way out of avoiding the computational burden. For a wide range of models, I am planning to study one-step minimum distance estimators and their asymptotic properties.

"The recent availability of the Biomedical Imaging and Therapy (BMIT) beam line at the Canadian Light Source (CLS) in Saskatoon is a truly exceptional and a unique opportunity to carry out research that has impact in the overall target area of biomedical technologies. During this strategic grant we propose to develop a high resolution dosimetric detector for use in monitoring the high dose profile in Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT). Microbeam Radiation Therapy is based on the irradiation of tumors with microplanar arrays of intense synchrotron-generated x-rays. Irradiation with parallel arrays of thin, planar slices of x-ray beams spares the normal tissue, including the central nervous system, and preferentially damages tumors. MRT has been shown to be of great benefit in cancer therapy, and relies on the availability of a synchrotron source - hence the exceptional and unique opportunity in Canada. One of the biggest problems in applying MRT is the measurement of the high dose profile in the synchrotron generated beam, since the dose is large and varies over distances of micrometers. Thus, a high spatial resolution, high dynamic range dosimetric detector is needed to be able to perform MRT. We propose a novel high resolution dosimetric detector plate which is based on the conversion of rare-earth (RE) ions in a glass or glass-ceramic plate to another oxidation state by the incident high dose radiation. The converted amount depends on the dose and is highly localized to the incident radiation region. The fluorescence emission from the new oxidation state (after suitable excitation) of the RE ion can be easily distinguished from that from unconverted ions. Fluoroscopic confocal imaging, with filters to remove the emission from unconverted RE ions, will be used to obtain the dose distribution. Further, the research will aim to develop reusable dosimetric plates, and will optimize the RE-doped plate medium, response and the read-out optics for high resolution measurements. The strategic project has direct enormous health benefits to Canada, uses the Canadian synchrotron, and trains HQP in interdisciplinary experimental skills.","Medical equipment and apparatus","Manufacturing processes and products","Electrical & Computer Engineering","Kasap, Safa","STPGP ","Biomedical engineering","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",1-3
"This is the second phase of an ongoing collaborative research and development (CRD) program with Anrad that aims to enhance the properties of a-Se alloys, and aims to develop models for a-Se photoconductors used in recently commercialized a-Se based x-ray image detectors for medical imaging. Recent research has shown clearly that the one of the most promising digital radiographic systems is a flat panel sensor system that would directly replace the outdated film cassette technology in present day x-ray clinics. This system is based on using a large area TFT active matrix array panel with an electroded x-ray photoconductor. Although the a-Se based flat panel detector has been already commercialized, there are still a number of unsolved technological problems that must be overcome to enhance the detector performance. One of the most important enhancements that can be made is in the n-like a-Se layer that is used to reduce the dark current. We hope to use the CRD project to carry out the following research: (i) Examine the addition of IIA dopants to stabilized a-Se to extend the earlier work to see whether stable material can be synthesized at all. (ii) Measure the charge carrier ranges??drift mobility x lifetime) in n-type a-Se by the IFTOF (Interrupted Field time-of-flight) transient photoconductivity. (iii) Continue the experimental work on the relaxation of the properties of a-Se alloys to examine the relaxation of the properties of n-layers as well and layers with As greater than 0.2%. (iv) Measure the dark current in p-i-n, i-n and single layers as a function of time and applied nominal field. (v) Develop useful models for the dark current so that it can be predicted as a function of time and applied field from the intrinsic material properties; and examine its dependence on x-ray exposure.(vi)  Examine the charge carrier and ghosting properties of a-Se layers as a function of exposure and temperature.Some of the alloys and films will be prepared at Anrad. During the tenure of the CRD grant we will concentrate our research efforts in these six areas in collaboration with Anrad. The proposed CRD grant builds on the expertise gained in the last phase and therefore starts from an already established know-how.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","Electrical & Computer Engineering","Kasap, Safa","CRDPJ ","Electronic materials and components","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",2-3

"Fibre Bragg gratings are generally written in fibres with ultra-violet lasers, or more recently with femtosecond pulse lasers. In order to increase the refractive index change for the purpose of fabricating strongly reflecting gratings through the exposure to the lasers, it has been necessary to photosensitise the optical fibre by doping the fibre with boron and/or with high pressure hydrogen of order 200Bar. The latter requires special equipment and handling and is the only technique available to write good gratings in standard optical fibres with UV lasers. Femtosecond lasers can be used with hydrogen-free fibres, but are generally used in a point-by-point writing, or with care using a phase-mask. The quality of gratings can be variable, without great care being used.

We have recently proposed and shown the writing of excellent gratings in boron and hydrogen-free fibres with a new laser on loan to us, allowing for the first time the writing very strong gratings in almost any optical fibre, using standard UV laser writing techniques. We have shown that strong gratings (R=99%, 3mm long) can be written in standard fibres without any hydrogen. We are the only group in the world to have suggested the use of this laser  for grating writing, and shown that very strong gratings can be also written in rare-earth doped fibres as well, without special treatment.  

This proposal is for the purchase of this laser from its only manufacturer, as it will give us a world lead in the fabrication of complex devices in almost any fibre without special treatment. Life without hydrogen would be greatly simplified.

"Neutron stars are the collapsed remnants of massive stars.  Containing typically 40% more mass than the Sun yet having radius of only about 10 km, neutron stars are the densest objects known in the Universe, with the exception of their close cousins, the black holes.  Neutron star densities exceed those in atomic nuclei.  Also remarkable is that they are known to rotate very rapidly, in some cases hundreds of times per second -- as fast as a kitchen blender.  They are also highly magnetized, with magnetic fields the highest known in the Universe.  This magnetic field results in amazing beams of radiation from the magnetic poles, sometimes observed as a bright pulse each rotation period.  Such neutron stars are termed ""pulsars"" and are like cosmic lighthouses.  This astonishing combination of extreme physical properties -- all impossible to simulate in Terrestrial laboratories today -- together with their observability, make neutron stars celebrated laboratories for studying fundamental physics, as well as basic astrophysics.  In this research program, my students, postdocs and I study neutron stars, particularly pulsars, in a variety of ways, all at the forefront of the field, and using the largest telescopes in the world. A major thrust is our work on magnetars -- isolated, young, ultra-highly magnetized pulsars.  These objects often show dramatic, spectacular X-ray behaviour, the study of which can constrain the nature of matter in extremely high magnetic fields. Another major thrust is searching for new radio pulsars in major surveys, using the largest radio telescopes in the world.  Here, in addition to fleshing out the radio pulsar population, we are searching for two ""Holy Grails"": a pulsar in orbit with a black hole, and a pulsar rotating faster than one thousand times per second.  The former could provide the most direct evidence for the existence of black holes, and offer new tests of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.  The latter would constrain the nature of matter at supra-nuclear densities. Our program is multi-wavelength in nature, with emphasis on X-ray and radio observations, but with significant IR and optical components as well.

"Osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease that often drastically reduces an individual's mobility that, according to Statistics Canada, has led to an expense of $5 billion annually when you consider health care costs and loss of productivity. It is recognized that mechanical factors play an important role in the etiology of knee injuries and diseases such as osteoarthritis. While performing daily activities, particularly during occupational and sport activities, the joint is exposed to vibrations and multiple impacts. Recognizing that the dynamic response characteristics of the human knee joint remains largely unknown, the goal of this study is to develop a basic understanding of the dynamics of the knee joint using both experimental and finite element methods. We hypothesize that changes in parameters that can affect joint dynamic loading condition such as preload, dynamic amplitude, and upper body mass as well as joint flexion angle and menisectomy can significantly influence the knee joint dynamic response. Determining the extent at which these parameters can affect joint dynamic characteristics is essential in research and development projects dealing with the effect of mechanical factors in causation, prevention and rehabilitation of knee injuries and osteoarthritis. The specific aims of this project are: 1- To perform experimental frequency response analyses of passive human knee joints. The knee joint dynamic system parameters and their alterations by changes in different loading conditions, joint flexion angle, and joint condition will be determined. Creep and relaxation tests will be also performed to provide data for verification of mathematical models of the knee joint. 2- To develop a nonlinear 3-D dynamic finite element model of the knee joint. The model will be validated by simulating the experiments and comparing the predicted finite element response with those of experiments. The validated model will be then used to gain more insights into the behavior of the joint. In the long term, vibration response analyses of the model in conjunction with experimental measurements is expected to introduce new diagnostic (vibration response signature), preventive, and therapeutic (vibration therapy) methods for osteoarthritis and knee injuries.

"This research program addresses one of the central problems in biology: the origin of diversity.  The bulk of existing theory concerns the conditions for its maintenance, given that it already exists. My goal is to identify the factors responsible for generating diversity in the first place. I use microbial systems to study the origins of diversity in two contexts.  The first is adaptive radiation - the rapid diversification of a lineage into a range of ecologically and phenotypically distinct niche specialists - of which the Galapagos finches and African rift lake cichlids are hallmark examples.  We study adaptive radiation in the laboratory using the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. Our aim is to understand the mechanisms governing the rate and extent of diversification. The second is the process that underlies diversification itself, adaptation. Our understanding of adaptation has not, until recently, moved much past Darwin's original idea that natural selection is the mechanism responsible. Our work aims to test the most compelling predictions of the increasingly sophisticated theory of adaptation that has developed over the past 10 years. We use the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans for this work as it has a number of unique features that allow us to document adaptive evolution in the laboratory and tease apart the underlying genetic changes responsible.  My lab offers outstanding opportunities for training in experimental evolution and allied fields (experimental design, microbiology) and I maintain close links with collaborators who provide complementary expertise for training in quantitative genetics, statistics, modeling and microbial genetics. This work makes some of the oldest and most fundamental problems in biology accessible to experimental research for the first time. I expect the results to be of wide and general interest, contributing to basic knowledge in evolution as well as more applied problems in medicine and conservation biology.

"Proteins make up the majority of the content of any type of cell.  Not surprisingly, they are also the main group of molecules responsible for carrying out the majority of tasks in cells that govern their shape and functionality.  In order for the proteins to ascertain their function, they have to physically interact with other molecules, most often other proteins.  This requires a complex network of protein interactions to be established in cells.  Methods are available that can analyze cells based on how they respond to changes brought upon them either by identifying all of the proteins that change in their relative amounts, or by identifying which other proteins interact with a selected protein.  While the former method analyzes all proteins at the same time, the latter can only study the protein that has been defined as target prior to the analysis.  Currently, no method exists that would be capable of analyzing how all proteins interact with each other, or how these interactions change in response to changes inside and outside of the cell.  We have previously developed a technique that can study protein interactions inside cells.  By adding a chemical to live cells, they are ""frozen"" in their respective state, which preserves individual protein interactions.  Bio-analytical techniques that are based on tandem mass spectrometry can then be used to determine individual protein interactions and the identity of each molecule that participates in them.  We are now proposing to refine and optimize this technique so it can be used for the determination of the complete set of protein interactions in cells and how they change.  Not only would this advance our understanding of how cells function, it could also one day be used to study internal and external influences that cause diseases in plants, animals, and humans, and to test countermeasures to prevent them.

"Commercial explosives typically produce water, nitrogen gas, carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and methane as product of detonation. Occasionally they also produce some oxides of nitrogen, which has increased toxicity and a cumulative effect on the human body.  Oxides of Nitrogen have received significant attention today since they plague mining operations, which conduct blasting in relatively weak ground. Such operations include the Canadian Oil Sands Mines and several large coal mines in Canada and throughout the world.  It is common knowledge that blends of ANFO and emulsion suffer from fume production.

The purpose of this research is to investigate toxic fume production from commonly used explosives in large scale production blasting and identify methods or conditions of use to minimize or eliminate them. The work will be of both experimental and theoretical nature. Queen's is in a unique position to tackle experimental investigations in the field of explosives, since it has a remote testing facility, equipped with blasting chambers so that controlled experiments can be performed.

The work will focus on fume production by blends of emulsions and ANFO, since this is a primary area of concern today. Experiments will be conducted with various ratios of ingredients, various particle sizes of ammonium nitrate prills, various sensitization methods in both the emulsion and ANFO phases, various initiation strengths and various confinements, ranging from very weak confinement provided by cardboard  to confinement in various rocks and concrete with a variety of strengths to identify parameters of importance.  The next step of the investigation will deal with the effect of adding energetic ingredients, such as Aluminum, in various concentrations, to increase the temperature of the detonation products, or ingredients that react with the fumes. Subsequently, the results of the experimental stage will be tried in field blasting, using innovative ways to capture gases from production blasts.  It is expected to generate significant interest from mining companies and explosives manufacturers.

The results of the experiments will provide information for theoretical models. Traditional equilibrium calculations are not sufficient to describe the decomposition of commercial explosives, which have long reaction zones .  Thus alternative methods, such as  work principle technique, will be examined.

The benefits of this research are significant. Apart from the obvious help in improving health and safety in blasting operations and surrounding communities, a significant body of experimental data will allow better understanding of commercial explosive performance and the reactions occuring during their detonation.

The program will train researchers at the M.Sc. and Ph.D. levels. Their skills will be significant in enhancing workplace safety in mining and construction and useful in a variety of disciplines related with the environmental impact of gaseous pollutants.

"The objective of a real-time traffic control system is to optimize the efficiency of traffic networks by responding to the dynamic and random nature of traffic on a real-time basis. Fluctuation of traffic depends on two main factors: 1) the control inputs that are directly related to corresponding control devices such as traffic lights and variable message signs (VMS) and 2) the disturbances such as demand variation and incidents whose values cannot be manipulated, but may be possibly measurable (e.g. demand), detectable (e.g. incident) or predictable over a certain time horizon (e.g. traffic flows). Thus, to achieve optimum control, traffic networks have to be continuously monitored, demand and incidents detected and predicted when possible, remedial and pro-active actions taken and control strategies injected in the system to fulfill a set of objectives all in real time. This research will integrate the previously mentioned processes to exchange information for optimum control of urban corridors. The primary goal of the work proposed is to reduce congestion effectively within corridor networks by developing an adaptive integrated corridor control for both recurring and non-recurring congestion by estimating/predicting external disturbances such as demand, incidents, and congestion conditions. The main control objective is to optimize all key controls (traffic signals) and routing (e.g. VMS) concurrently to achieve a set of criterion, such as minimizing total vehicular delay in the network, total queue length, increasing throughput and increasing safety. 

The formulated optimal-control problem will be resolved in real time by applying three tools from Artificial Intelligence as follows: 1) Parallel Genetic Algorithms (PGAs) as the main optimization methods that provide traffic-responsive queue management and delay schemes, 2) Neural Networks (NN) for short term congestion estimation/prediction, and 3) Data Fusion algorithms to detect incidents based on machine vision and detectors information.","Transportation systems and services","Transportation systems and services","Civil Engineering","Kattan, Lina","RGPIN ","Transportation engineering","Civil engineering","G�nie civil",1-5

"Proteins and small natural peptides play a key role in many biological phenomena by interacting with other biomolecules, and often provide excellent therapeutic pathways.  However, natural proteins and peptides are frequently susceptible to proteolysis and metabolism, where they can be ""consumed"" or ""broken down"" by other biological entities before they reach their targets.  Synthetic molecules that mimic natural peptides, but are conformationally and metabolically more stable, such as beta-peptides, are therefore viable alternatives as therapeutics.  The folded structures of these unnatural peptide-mimics or peptidomimetics can provide enhanced interaction with the biological systems, just like the natural peptides with stable secondary structure facilitate some interactions better than others.  The objective of the proposed research is to study structure-activity relationship among two new families of synthetic beta-peptides.  These beta-peptides will be synthesized from easily accessible L-aspartic acid and beta-amino-L-alanine monomers.  In this context, peptide and peptidomimetic analogs of several biologically active peptides such as class IIa bacteriocins and a short peptide sequence from SARS virus receptor protein, will be synthesized and the relationship of their conformation to activity will be studied.  An alternate approach to the design of metabolically stable peptidomimetics is the use of a carrier system for the delivery of potent natural peptides, such as a bacterial system or liposomes.  Peptide analogs of microcin J25 will be synthesized for delivery using a bacterial expression system.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science, Faculty of","Kaur, Kamaljit","RGPIN ","Bio-organic chemistry","Organic chemistry","Chimie organique",2-3

"For host defence, disease prevention and therapy, knowledge of the immune system and its regulation in health and disease is of fundamental importance. Towards this goal, our research is focused on 'antibody genetics and autoimmunity'. We made an original discovery of unique functional IgM antibodies in cattle, the largest known to exist in a species. This offers opportunity to develop novel antibody engineering strategies for prevention of those diseases where conventional therapies fail, e.g., cancer, autoimmune diseases and viral infections. My proposed research aims at defining 'structure-function' relationships of these novel types of antibodies and, also to develop a vaccine against bovine leukemia virus. These studies also involve understanding the development of the neonatal immune system aimed at strengthening the host defence of newborns against infections. Other studies are focused on the origin of autoantibodies that cause systemic autoimmune disease, such as Lupus and arthritis. We have observed that pathogenic autoantibodies originate from the impaired development of the antibody repertoire at newborn stage. The role of B-cell selection in generating systemic autoimmune disease is not well understood. The proposed studies are aimed at identifying the anatomical location where white blood cells (B-cells) producing pathogenic autoantibodies, especially of the IgM type, originate so that these could be targeted for elimination by therapeutic intervention in patients afflicted with autoimmune disease. The IgM autoantibody type is studied since these appear first and initiate autoimmune disease.



Significance: Studies of 'structure-function' of cattle antibodies will advance engineering of antibodies for application in diagnosis, vaccine development and immunotherapy across species including humans, apart from strengthening immunity in the newborns. The vaccine against bovine leukemia virus will prevent economic losses to cattle industry. Knowledge of the origin of IgM autoantibodies that appear first in autoimmune disease will permit detection and prevention of disease progression in the early stages.

"Therapeutic antibodies (Abs) are used to treat a variety of diseases, from cancer to infectious disease. They are  a new and rapidly-expanding class of drug in today's pharmaceutical market, with a single drug generating up to $5B/year. A limiting step in discovery of Abs against a targeted, disease-associated molecule is the screening process. In a labor intensive step, thousands of Ab-secreting cell (ASC) clones are generated, and their Abs screened for binding to the targeted molecule. ASCs whose Ab binds to the targeted molecule are then used to generate cell lines that will produce the Ab in large quantities.

We propose to demonstrate a new type of biosensor for monitoring, in real time, the Abs produced by thousands of live ASCs, so as to identify those that bind targeted, disease-associated molecules. The project combines the expertise of university researchers at Simon Fraser University (SFU) and the University of Victoria (UVic) with our industrial partner, Cangene Corp. (Manitoba). The goals of the project fall squarely within the NSERC Strategic Target Area: ""Biomedical Technology"" and in particular, the demonstration of a cost-effective, low-maintenance device for sensing dynamic cellular events in a living system. The new sensor is based on the modification in the transmission of light through a nanostructure, by the biological products from individual cells. The nanostructure is an array of nanoscale holes fabricated in a gold film located adjacent to an individual ASC. The ASCs are manipulated and trapped in vitro via microfluidics technology. Abs produced by living ASCs will attach to sites on the gold film resulting in a change in surface light generation and transmission. If successful this technology will enhance the discovery of therapeutic Abs manufactured by Cangene and other companies involved in this burgeoning area of the pharmaceutical industry.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services",Physics,"Kavanagh, Karen","STPGP ","Biomedical technology","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",2-3

   The interface found between any two structures is often the location of interesting science and information transfer. This is true for natural interfaces, such as cell membranes, and artificially manufactured semiconductor interfaces, such as those found in optoelectronic applications. Cell phones, computers, and solid state light sources all rely on charge and or light transfer through interfaces to semiconductors. The efficiency and thus cost of operation of these systems and devices is directly related to the interface properties and because of this, much basic and applied research has focused on this area. With device volumes and characterization capabilities moving ever smaller, interface questions continue to be important. 

    The research program proposed here plans to control the fabrication and to characterize the properties of localized contacts to semiconductor nanostructures through the application of electrodeposition. An approach that is more than a century old, electrodeposition finds many applications today. In particular, the manufacture of silicon integrated circuits relies on electrodeposition for the growth of copper wiring and solder-bump chip contacts to circuit boards. Besides the advantage of being a cost effective technique, the ability to drive the contact location via potentiostatic or galvanostatic control means that patterned contacts are readily feasible.

    We will fabricate by electrodeposition, end-on or side wall contacts to nanowires of GaAs and other semiconductors, including GaSb, InP, ZnO. Characterization of the charge transfer characteristics, contact structure, and magnetic properties will be carried out via techniques that include scanning transmission electron microscopy, electron holography, and ballistic electron emission microscopy. These almost one-dimensional systems, displaying a range of fascinating contact properties, are challenging our two-dimensional ideas. This work will contribute towards a better understanding of their properties combined with the development of new approaches to their reliable fabrication.

"The successful folding of newly formed protein molecules is essential for their function, which in turn is necessary for the survival of the cell. Protein molecules face obstacles on the folding pathway since the fact that the cell is very crowded leads to a high probability of aggregation or misfolding. The cell, therefore, uses a series of accessory proteins, termed molecular chaperones, which minimize protein misfolding. The objective of this research proposal is to develop and use solution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study the interactions between these chaperones and the polypeptide chains that they help fold. Specifically, we will target one of the most important molecular chaperone systems, the GroEL/GroES system. (1) We will probe the structure and dynamics of several substrates of GroEL/GroES when these substrates are inside the cavity. (2) Folding mutants of these substrates will be prepared and studied inside the cavity and in the absence of chaperone to provide insight into the nature of the interactions between substrate and GroEL/GroES. (3) Novel NMR methods will be developed to probe interactions between labeled substrate molecules and unlabeled GroEL/GroES or vice versa. The work described will provide insight into the mechanism of protein folding and how large molecular chaperone machines are able to affect this process. Moreover, it will open up the possibility of studying unstable proteins that cannot be investigated currently by using the chaperone to 'protect' them from aggregation. This will facilitate the study of 'misfolding' pathways whose end-products can lead to the formation of fibers that have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. New NMR methods will be developed that will have a broad impact on a range of macromolecular  applications.

"The liquid-vapour phase change in porous media plays a vital role in a wide variety of engineering applications. Although significant progress has been made in the past, some elements of phase-change phenomena are not well understood despite many years of extensive research. One of the areas where there is currently a need for further research is liquid-vapour interface instabilities of the capillary-driven flows. The interface instabilities can lead to performance anomalies and mechanical damage of heat transfer equipment by altering the phase-change process. The proposed research project aims to study thermo-hydraulic instabilities encountered during the liquid-vapour phase change process in porous media through experimental and numerical investigation. One of the main goals of the project is to expand a previously developed mathematical model to be able to suggest design improvements to eliminate or remedy the performance anomalies. 

A better understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of these instabilities would be of great importance for several technological applications (fuel cells, nuclear reactors, energy transfer, chemical processing, etc.). An important application area of growing importance is two-phase capillary-pumped heat transfer devices. These devices are used to transfer excess heat from a heat-producing component such as a microprocessor in a computer or an electronic instrument in a spacecraft, while maintaining the temperature within a specified range. The advantages of these devices over conventional cooling techniques include simplicity, lack of moving parts, and the ability to transfer large amounts of heat over long distances. In the absence of better mathematical models, advancement in this technology will remain difficult.

"The thermal properties of materials used in nuclear reactors, either as constituents of fuel or as components in the reactor or containment systems, are not always well characterized at higher temperatures.  As nuclear power plants push the design envelopes by taking the reactors to higher power outputs, the fuel is running hotter.  This has implications for safety analysis when the materials are taken outside their designed function.

This research program will:

1)  Investigate metallic systems that form during nuclear fuel burn-up to determine their thermal properties;

2)  Develop the experimental methodologies to improve the accuracy of thermodynamic data for use in simulation models;

3)  Develop novel materials for use in advanced nuclear fuel cycles;

4)  Develop fundamental understanding of materials properties for use in hydrogen generation technologies.

5)  Develop Highly Qualified Personnel with a knowledge of thermochemistry as it relates to the nuclear and energy sectors.

The first three phases of the research program involve projects that will:

i)  Examine metallic systems in nuclear fuel;

ii)  Develop a sensor for measuring the oxygen pressure at high temperatures;

iii)  Measure thermochemical properties of materials in connection with hydrogen generation from the copper-chlorine cycle.

"Deep mining faces technological and operational challenges that require intensive research focus to manage the risks associated with Greenfield projects. These risks are related to higher temperatures/stress compared to ""normal"" mining conditions. Among the strategies to counter the risk associated with mine production systems at depth is the greater control of variables and the introduction of new technologies. Ground-related problems will be a particular focus in deep mines, and will require the justification of design alternatives that optimize the overall risk profile of a mining system. The question of which measures are appropriate to be introduced for deep mining is posed at the feasibility stage, where irreversible decisions in terms of infrastructure, method and technology needs are being made. The proposed work evaluates the interaction of quality and flexibility assessment in the planning and design of underground mines with ground-problem delays being the risk impediment to the production system. Quality measures can be introduced to enhance the performance of mine operations through statistical analyses that require cost and uncertainty data in a process capability/performance simulation analysis.  Flexibility assessment through the application of real options and process simulation can provide the justification of alternatives that improve the robustness of a production system to meet its targets and the optimization of a system. The methodology in this research project includes the application of statistical methods and real options analysis to process simulation modelling, through case study work where ground-problem delays and the potential alternative to ameliorate their impact are considered. Quality enhancement and introduction of flexibility will have important capital and operating cost implications in the design of deep mining systems with the justification of alternatives being a function of the frequency and the impact of ground problems. The result will provide a vehicle for the evaluation of alternatives containing both flexibility and quality components.

"Unprecedented high levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which have been attributed, to a great extent, to excessive use of fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation, are believed to be the cause of climate change, in general, and global warming, in specific. The consequences are devastating and include droughts, floods, higher than usual temperatures, which threaten food crops and species, destroy habitats, and increase the incidence of diseases.  The heavy environmental penalty of strong dependence on fossil fuels for energy, dwindling fossil fuel reserves and energy security concerns are the motivation behind seeking alternative approaches for powering vehicular systems and generating electricity. In an attempt to secure energy to fuel growth and prosperity in harmony with nature, the applicant proposes a research program which addresses both issues of transportation and electricity generation. The objectives of the proposed research program are to pursue new and improved system configurations, converter topologies, energy storage systems, control techniques and power management strategies for: (i) distributed electricity generation based on wind and solar energy, as well as microturbines and fuel cells, and (ii) vehicular systems (including battery-electric, hybrid electric and hybrid fuel cell vehicles). The goal is to improve efficiency of conversion and storage, as well as overall efficiency, to increase power transfer capability, reduce the initial cost, optimize performance, and boost reliability of these systems.

"This research programme has two principal thrusts. One direction continues work carried out in the

last five years on the numerical solution of time dependent partial differential equations in one

space variable. Differential equations occur in many physical models, and often the solution

exhibits narrow layers with peaks or sharp variations. In many cases these peaks or areas of rapid

change move in time. For an approximate method of solution to be able to catch these features, the

discrete model must adapt to the solution. Software to approximate to the solutions with reliable error

estimates will be developed. We will investigate the use of high order interpolants in a method of

lines context, in order to obtain inexpensive and reliable error estimates. Using an

equi-distribution algorithm we will ensure that the error globally satisfies a user-defined error

tolerance.



The second thrust, which also is a continuation of a long standing research programme, is

the construction of methods for the numerical evaluation of integrals over multidimensional

regions having specified symmetries.  Examples of such regions are the n dimensional cube,

sphere, simplex, octahedron, spherical surface, and the whole of n-space with a symmetric

weight function. As shown in an earlier paper there is a strong connection between formulas

for the surface of the sphere and for the simplex. It is intended to investigate connections

between formulas for the octahedron and the simplex. A long term plan is to set up software

to accept as input the symmetries of the region, and a requested polynomial degree, and then

to compute consistent structures for the formulas, set up the defining equations, and solve

them.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Mathematics and Statistics","Keast, Patrick","RGPIN ","Numerical analysis","Applied mathematics","Math�matiques appliqu�es",3-5

The following developments and improvements are planned: (1) better description of bacterial and protozoal dynamics in the rumen (2) improved description of post-rumen absorption and retention of nutrients and (3) production of integrated model which will be used to develop new feeding strategies and evaluated experimentally. The integrated model will use a novel approach of introducing discontinuity in animal models. The model will simulate feeding patterns similar to those used by producers and therefore expected to predict nutrient utilization more accurately. Nutritionists can use the model to identify gaps of knowldege and determine their future research direction. The model will have a user-friendly graphical interface and will be made available online which would allow regular updates as more knowledge from the literature and future experiments becomes available. The model can be used as a decision support system which will allow more efficient feeding strategies and options for mitigating environmental pollution including greenhouse gases to be devised. Research scientists, producers, advisors and policy makers are expected to use the model.

"No Molecule is an Island: Intermolecular Forces Rule! Most chemistry takes place in the liquid phase where many important properties such as vapour pressure, boiling point, surface tension, and viscosity can be explained in terms of the interactions between molecules. Intermolecular interactions are one of the principal forces that govern molecular recognition and influence the structures of proteins, DNA, and solid materials. They also play a significant role in the control of interactions of certain drugs with DNA and the conductive properties of molecular wires (single molecules that can form electrically conducting bridges).



How intermolecular interactions affect a liquid's physical and molecular properties is the focus of Dr. Dale Keefe's research. Keefe investigates the microscopic properties of molecules and, in particular, their vibrations.  These interactions are studied using techniques such as infrared and Raman spectroscopy and computer simulations.  This research has the potential to have impact in many areas of chemistry, biochemistry, biology and chemical physics.

"Cellular and molecular evolution is generally considered to proceed by many slow, gradual changes, but certain kinds of events can also lead to rapid, drastic changes. Although rare, such events can have a substantial impacts on the cell and genome where they take place, so their overall importance rivals that of the more gradual processes. We are studying the effects of two such events in complex microbial cells. 

         (A) Lateral gene transfer is the non-sexual movement of genes between different organisms, and we have shown that collectively such transfers have played an important role in shaping the content of genomes in protozoa and algae. One gene we discovered is EFL, a member of the translation factor family thought to play a key role in cellular information flow. We showed EFL has the highest known frequency of transfer between eukaryotes, and is now scattered among distantly related lineages. We will use environmental methods to determine the abundance and distribution of EFL in nature, and will also carry out the first direct tests of its function, revealing the impact of its frequent transfers between cells.

         (B) Endosymbiosis is the fusion and genetic integration of two cells, which drives the generation and spread of new functional organelles. The exchange of information is key to this process, and will examine how proteins from one compartment are specifically targeted to another in a complex cell where one eukaryote lives within another, and four genome-containing compartments have been retained. Because of this genetic integration, organelles are difficult to lose entirely. We will characterise plastid relicts in non-photosynthetic lineages believed to have once contained plastids, and determining how biochemical functions were redistributed in the cell during organelle degeneration. Lastly, cellular mergers create redundancy in structures and metabolic activities. Redundancy is normally eliminated in one of the partner cells, but we have identified a cell where many redundant features f two eukaryotes are retained, uniquely including both mitochondria. Using genomic sequencing we will compare the functions of co-habiting organelles. 

        Altogether this work will represent major advances in several directions for our understanding of rare but transformative events that shape cells and genomes.

"Constructing and manipulating a computational model is central in many computer science applications. Unfortunately, often the problems that naturally arise turn out to be hard, in the sense that the best known algorithms cannot find exact solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Computational models involving graphs are pervasive in applications, and where physical objects are modeled, geometric models are important. The objective of this research program is to develop effective algorithmic approaches to some natural hard geometric and graph theoretic problems. The approaches will include the development of algorithms that yield approximate solutions as well as algorithms that yield exact solutions but only to restricted instances of the problems.



The overall approach is to focus on the interplay between the areas of algorithmic graph theory and computational geometry. We will seek to exploit the natural relationships that exist among the problems, concepts and techniques of the two areas.



In this research we focus on the following areas: polygon decomposition, triangulation, proximity problems and intersection graphs. In each of these areas there are many hard problems that arise in applications and in each there exists interplay between computational geometry and graph theory. In polygon decomposition, the goal is to represent a polygon as the union of a small number of simple components which are easier to subsequently process. Likewise a triangulation is used to represent a complex area as the union of triangles.This can be done in many different ways and sometimes the best way may be expensive to compute. Proximity problems involve computations that depend upon the distances between objects.   Intersection graphs can arise from modeling a geometric problem with graphs.

"Transglutaminases (TGases) are calcium-dependent enzymes that catalyse the formation of cross-links between proteins.  TGases play vital physiological roles such as the stabilization of blood clots and the extracellular matrix in tissues.  They have also been implicated in several disorders including the deposition of plaques associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases), cancer metastasis and Celiac disease.   Past work in the Keillor group on the mechanism of action of TGases has laid the groundwork for the research to be carried out over the next granting period:

1) TGase mechanistic studies:  The acceptor substrate binding site will be located and the conformational equilibrium will be studied.  

2) TGase inhibition studies:  New series of inhibitors will be prepared and evaluated in our group, in the design of high affinity ligands as therapeutic lead compounds.

3) TGase chemical biology:  Fluorescent probes designed to identify and localize TGases and their native protein substrates will be prepared and evaluated in vitro  and in cell culture. 

4) TGase engineering:  The transamidase activity of TGase is unique and will be tailored by directed evolution toward two specific applications - the site-specific labelling of proteins with fluorophores and with sugars.

     The bioorganic chemistry in this proposal embodies a highly developed combination of enzymology, synthetic and physical organic chemistry, biochemistry and cell biology.  The short-term results will represent important contributions to understanding enzyme structure-function relationships and biocatalysis. The long-term results deriving from the application of this understanding will include the development of useful inhibitor drugs and the design of novel biocatalysts for practical application.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Chimie,"Keillor, Jeffrey","RGPIN ","Bio-organic chemistry","Organic chemistry","Chimie organique",1-5
"Over the past few decades, great advances have been made in the understanding human movement and how disabilities impede normal function. There is a great need to fully understand the mechanisms by which the human upper extremity (shoulder, arm, and hand) becomes injured with everyday use. These disorders involve muscle tissue (muscle pain), connective tissue (e.g. tennis elbow), and peripheral nerves (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome). By understanding the control of movement and the way muscle, tendon and ligament forces interact inside the arm, we can ultimately prevent disorders, especially those developed at work. 

  Unlike injuries to the lower back, disorders of the upper extremity tend to occur over time and cannot be attributed to a specific event, thus the mechanical origins of upper extremity injuries are elusive. Studies indicate that loads, postures and motion are highly linked to injury risk. Compensatory strategies to control the hand, arm and shoulder muscles may indicate which individuals are susceptible to greater individual muscle loading, fatigue and injury. My research program methodically investigates the effects of muscular loading by monitoring arm movement, muscle activity and their interactions with computer-based modeling. We use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound to examine structural changes in the wrist in different wrist postures during pinching actions to determine mechanics of nerve compression in carpal tunnel syndrome. We also examine the activation patterns (timing and magnitude) of shoulder, arm and hand muscles to determine how muscles work to create movement in specific tasks. By doing studies such as these when people's muscles are fresh and when they are fatigued, we can determine the way people deal with tiring stereotypical movements like on an assembly line. A major part of this research program is to develop and improve the computer model to predict forces inside the arm and hand. By combining muscle activity and anatomical data in a computer model, we can test theories on how disorders develop and how to prevent them as well as ask ""what would happen if ...?"" questions that otherwise could not be answered ethically.

"Cryptography is the field that uses mathematical techniques to secure information.  The rapid rise of computer and communications technology, especially the widespread use of the Internet, has greatly increased the demand for such techniques.  For example, trillions of dollars of currency exchanges are carried out each day, and these must be encoded in such a way that malicious parties cannot view or tamper with them (even if they are sent over publicly accessible networks).  Symmetric-key cryptographic primitives such as block ciphers, hash functions, and stream ciphers are fundamental components of the infrastructure that enables such transactions to be carried out  securely and efficiently.



My research has been dedicated to the analysis of symmetric-key primitives for the past 10 years.  Over this time, I have developed a series of new techniques (algorithms) for analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of important classes of primitives.  This proposal is focused on the full development of my techniques into a cryptographic toolkit that can be readily used by other researchers who are studying existing primitives or designing new ones.  I also propose to extend the rigour of the standard analysis of such primitives by removing simplifying assumptions that can hide weaknesses.

"Over the past several decades, Oceanographers have created numerical models of the ocean, akin to weather models.  As with weather models, improvements have come along as computing power has increased, making it possible to simulate a wider fraction of the observed ocean phenomena.  For example, the first ocean models were too coarse to resolve the approximately ten-kilometre scale ocean eddies, but it is now becoming possible to do this, at least for short-term predictions.  Unfortunately, there are important ocean phenomena that are too small to be handled by any imaginable computer.  A case in point is ocean mixing, which occurs on centimetre scales, far below the 10-kilometre limit of today's models.  Ocean measurements reveal that this mixing occurs in complicated patterns, and sensitivity tests with models indicate that small variations in those patterns create large changes in the overall state of the ocean.  That leaves Oceanographers in a bind.  The only solution seems to be to parameterize the mixing, i.e. to approximate its affects using only the large-scale properties that the models can handle directly.  My work centres on creating such parameterizations of various ocean mixing phenomena.  The focus over the next several years will be mixing caused by high-frequency internal waves in coastal waters.  Funded by NSERC and CFCAS, my group has amassed a particularly detailed set of observations of the phenomenon.  The hope is to use this along with small-scale numerical simulations to develop more reliable parameterizations of this mode of mixing.

This platform has to date been applied towards the development of new assays for early cancer diagnosis and bacterial detection, and its performance indicates that it is robust and practical enough for use as a clinical diagnostic.  With support of a Steacie Fellowship and the Research Tools and Infrastructure program, our focus will be directed towards a new problem: leveraging the capabilities of this technology for detection of the deadly Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogen.

"While a variety of biosensing methodologies are available that allow interactions between biomolecules to be visualized, most are too costly for routine use and general adaptation.  Electrochemical methods - in principle inexpensive to implement and highly sensitive - represent an underutilized approach towards sensing of biological targets.  In order to use electrochemistry as a means of detecting biomolecular analytes for biological and environmental monitoring, two critical technological components are needed.  First, an electrode chip must be fabricated that allows multiplexed measurements to be made with high throughput, and second, a reporter system must be developed that will permit analytes to be detected without complicated sample workup.  



The proposed project will develop both of these key components.  The first aim of the project will focus on the optimization and engineering of a novel family of structures - nanotextured microelectrodes - that are easily multiplexed into a chip format.  The behavior of the electrodes will be characterized and the performance of these structures in biosensing assays will be evaluated.  The second aim of the project will be to engineer a series of electrochemical reporter systems that will allow a variety of biological analytes to be detected.  Electrocatalytic reactions specific to pairs of biomolecular analytes that are able to readout the presence of biologically active complexes will be utilized for this purpose.  The integration of the optimized reporter systems and the novel electrode platforms will impart superior sensitivity to electrochemical sensing approaches. The advances made in the course of this project will provide new tools for biological and environmental monitoring that rely on low-cost instrumentation and straightforward measurements of electrical current.

"The goal of this research program is to acquire a better process-based understanding of the environmental factors that affect soil organic matter storage and structure alongside production and consumption of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane through soil profiles of managed forests. The evaluation of stable isotope techniques as a tool for separating cycling processes comprises a key component of this research plan, and is designed to contribute to a better understanding of stable isotopes as tracers of biogeochemical processes in managed environments.  

Over the short term, the specific objectives are: (1) to investigate how soil-atmosphere exchanges of greenhouse gases change through a forest harvest cycle and to understand the processes controlling net soil surface and depth-dependent exchanges, (2) to investigate factors that may be responsible for accelerated deep soil organic carbon decomposition following harvesting, and (3) to investigate how forest harvesting has altered the pattern of nitrogen storage and transport, and its potential consequences for soil organic carbon storage.  Over the long term, the objectives of this research are to contribute to improved quantification of carbon and nitrogen dynamics in managed and unmanaged watersheds and to develop a clear process-based understanding of their sensitivities to environmental change.  

Using an experimental design that incorporates field, climate-controlled phytotron, and laboratory approaches, the proposed research will improve our current understanding of the factors that control soil-atmosphere carbon and nitrogen exchanges in managed forest soils.  This information will improve our ability to simulate changes in forested ecosystems under future climate change scenarios and landuse practices, parameterize and develop process-based models, test the utility of existing biogeochemical models, as well as develop solid landuse management policies and climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.

"The ability of fish to move freely within a stream is critical to their long-term survival.  Through migration, they are able to access suitable spawning grounds, food sources and sites offering protection from predators.  Among other, the maintenance of a healthy fish population is important for sustainable development.  Where blockages to fish migration occur, such as at dams or weirs, it is important that fish passage facilities be constructed.  An emerging approach to fish passage technology is the nature-like fishway.

     Nature-like fishways are an ecological approach to fish passage at an obstruction in a stream.  In many ways, they are an artificial replicate of a natural channel formed in coarse alluvial sediments (e.g., gravel, cobbles).  Relative to conventional fishways, which favor only the few species and life stages for which they were designed, nature-like fishways are amenable to the passage of a wide variety of fish, including both species and size.  They also provide for improved fishery habitat, including sources of food such as benthic organisms.  Furthermore, they can be more cost effective, often costing considerably less than one-half that of a conventional fishway.  However, the adoption of nature-like fish passage technology has been constrained by a lack of suitable design information.  The proposed research will provide some of the missing information.

     The focus of the proposed research is on the preferential pathways, or micro-channels, that fish use in ascending a nature-like fishway.  These pathways are thought to be of considerable importance with respect to fish utilization of nature-like fishways, but at this time no mechanism exists to specifically design for them.  Using a series of physical hydraulic models, and some numerical modeling, the proposed research will allow us to develop a better understanding of how fish can utilize a nature-like fishway.  The proposed research, with its strong emphasis on the development of improved design criteria, will allow increased use of such structures with greater operational reliability and certainty.  The findings of the work are expected to be of interest to water resource engineers, fisheries resource managers, and others.

"All mobile species must orient, yet we know surprisingly little about how this process is achieved. My general objective is to study how animals orient within their environments.  Spatial information can be classified as features or geometry.   Features are objects (e.g., trees or rocks); whereas geometry is the metric relationship between objects or surfaces, (e.g., distances or directions). The relative reliance on these cues may be influenced by development.  One testable hypothesis is that with maturity, cue encoding shifts from local cues to include more distant cues. To examine this hypothesis, I will rear birds in my laboratory and through tests which systematically alter their environment, examine how spatial cue use changes with development.  Ecological pressures may also influence how spatial cues are used.  In this case, the testable hypothesis is that animals which rely on their spatial memories for survival will encode stable cues that are robust to environmental change - i.e., geometry, whereas animals which rely on their spatial memory for short time periods will use cues that are very distinctive but not as stable - i.e., features.  To test this hypothesis, I will investigate spatial cue use in three species of related birds.  Two of these species are food-storing birds, each relying on their ability to store food to differing degrees, whereas the third species does not store food at all.  By examining how these birds use spatial cues I can determine whether the ecological pressure of food-storing influences which spatial cues are encoded.  Finally, birds allow for a unique opportunity to examine how each brain hemisphere encodes spatial cues. Birds lack a corpus callosum, the major source of interhemispheric connections in humans. This results in a ""natural split-brain"" like situation; visual information coming into the right eye is processed by the left hemisphere and vice versa for the left eye.  Using a non-invasive eye capping technique, I will investigate how each hemisphere works independently, as well as how the two hemispheres work together to encode spatial cues.  The novelty of my research program will take the field of spatial cognition in new directions, with implications for basic science, clinical neuropsychology and neuroscience.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge",Psychology,"Kelly, Debbie","RGPIN ",Psychology,Psychology,Psychologie,1-5
"Scientific software is computational application software that predicts paths of hurricanes, guides surgeons in orthopedic surgery, supports engineers who design bridges and aircraft, and supplies data for the safe operation of nuclear generating plants. It is software that is largely written by scientists and provides data to help scientists and engineers make decisions. There are two problems. First, numerous articles have been written either questioning the extent we can trust scientific software or giving examples where a very simple software error has compromised output data. Second, no software engineering practices have been empirically validated for use specifically with scientific software. The aim of our research is to identify and validate software engineering practices that are time-efficient and result-effective when used by the scientists themselves.

For various reasons, scientific software is extremely complex to write and is difficult to test. Insidious errors can remain hidden for years. The one quality unanimously important to scientists is that the software gives the ""right answer"". For a software engineering practice to be useful to a scientist, it must provide observable benefits in finding or preventing software errors that affect ""getting the right answer"". Those benefits must be balanced against the difficulty and time required for the scientists to put the practice into use.

The first step in our research is characterizing the development environment of scientific software. We have already made progress here. The second step is to validate the efficacy of specific practices in the environment of the scientific software developer. Practices can be related to the development of the software, its successful maintenance over its typically long lifetime, or the assessment of the software by testing or peer review. It is important that our researchers work directly with scientists to observe, to learn, to make adjustments and to verify that practices provide real benefits. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide the scientific software developer with a handbook of practices with pedigrees in the area of scientific development. This handbook will give the scientists efficient and effective ways to ensure their software ""gives the right answer"".

"Communication between cells is no different than that between individuals over a phone, where ideally one speaks and the other listens.  Carrying a conversation relies on active participants that trade places, taking turns speaking and listening.  With cell phones, information travels from the mobile device to a number of towers in a network, finding the quickest route to the appropriate receiver.  Given the number of calls made in any one network and at any one time, there is a chance your call may disrupt someone else's in what is called undesirable crosstalk. Cell-cell communication is comparable and cells have multiple networks each a signaling pathway composed of numerous protein components that receive and pass on information in the form of molecular signals to and from the nucleus.  Unlike cell phone communication, cells have networks that are interconnected and allow for desirable crosstalk, linking many pathways and providing a mechanism that finely tunes the original signal and the cell's response depending on the conditions. What starts out as beneficial to a cell, however, can turn disastrous when undesirable crosstalk upsets the balance and the original signal gets misinterpreted.  This is the case when one signaling pathway accepts the wrong signal into the network, or accepts the right one, but at the wrong time. This also happens when a signaling pathway is flooded with crosstalk from multiple pathways. This mis-information weakens the integrity of the entire signaling network. For a cell, the end result is the breakdown in the normal circuitry, which has dire consequences as there is now uncontrollable ""chatter"" and no way to ""hand-off"" the appropriate signal to the next player.  My major objective is to understand how signaling pathways decipher and regulate the crosstalk converging on them, allowing for the correct flow of molecular information to occur while quenching undesirable signaling.  Elucidating the mechanisms by which cells use crosstalk to modulate signaling pathways during embryonic development is of great importance as atypical, unnecessary and often surplus crosstalk is correlated later to disease conditions including, but not limited to cancer, kidney disease, osteoporosis and Schizophrenia.

"    )	The proposed research will examine the role of the central nervous system in auditory perception and the discrimination of temporal features of complex sounds. Neural circuits located along the auditory pathway from the ear to auditory cortex are important for the identification of complex sounds associated with environmental events or species-specific communication signals including human speech sounds. The ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL) is a major collection of neurons in the auditory pathway that is thought to be involved in processing temporal properties of complex sounds. This research project will examine how the neurons in the VNLL contribute to the analysis of temporal features of sounds. We will record physiological responses from single neurons in the rat's VNLL while applying pharmacological agents to the cells to determine how their synaptic chemistry regulates auditory response characteristics.  We will also examine the response properties of cells elsewhere in the auditory pathway while activity in the VNLL is blocked by either drug application or local damage of nerve cells. These studies will allow us to determine the functional contribution of the VNLL to central auditory processing. In addition, we will conduct behavioral studies to determine how damage to the VNLL affects hearing and the ability of animals to distinguish sounds based on their temporal structure. The studies will shed light on how complex features of sounds are processed by neural circuits and represented by neural activity within the central auditory system. The outcome of the experiments will also have important implications for understanding deafness and central auditory processing disorders in humans.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge",Psychology,"Kelly, Jack","RGPIN ","Sensory systems -- auditory",Psychology,Psychologie,3-5

"The retina is a thin layer of transparent tissue made up of neurons and non-neural cells that are responsible for converting visual images into electrical signals. These electrical signals are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve and result in our visual perception. The primary non-neural cells in the retina are glial cells. There are two different types of glial cells in the retina:  M�ller glia and astrocytes. M�ller glia are the principal glial cell type in the vertebrate retina and are radial glia that span three synaptic layers. M�ller glia provide important homeostatic functions, including neurotransmitter uptake and buffering of ions released during neuronal activity. In addition, M�ller glia also directly participate with neurons in bidirectional communication. They do this by responding to released neurotransmitters and, in turn, releasing glial transmitters and neuroactive molecules that can have effects on retinal neurons and vasculature. Receptor-activated calcium increases are key to the response of these cells to neurotransmitters and to the subsequent release of glial transmitters. Increases in calcium in M�ller glia involve calcium release from intracellular stores and calcium entry across the cell membrane. Alterations in M�ller glia calcium signaling are associated with gliosis, a condition in which quiescent M�ller glia in the postnatal retina proliferate in response to injury. Our research is examining the cellular pathways, specifically calcium entry channels, involved in receptor-activated calcium increases in M�ller glia and the relationship between glial calcium signals and cell proliferation. These studies will provide new knowledge about glial cell signaling in the retina and are fundamental for understanding the role of glial cells in retinal physiology and pathophysiology.

"Snow water storage is a key part of the water cycle. Estimating the volume of seasonal snow water storage has been attempted using satellite remote sensing and physically-based numerical models. However, uncertainties from satellite observations can be great, especially at the local scale, and hydrology models rely on meteorological measurements which are often not available in remote locations. This proposal seeks to combine satellite remote sensing measurements with a hydrological model to assess the use of remote sensing observations for augmenting model estimates in remote locations. The project will combine three snow measurements from three different remote sensing systems to produce a blended snow water equivalent (SWE) data set. Then, by installing two weather stations locally that can measure environmental variables at two local sites a hydrologic model capable of simulating seasonal snow water storage will be run. The model will also be run using coarse scale regional climate model input data from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) at Environment Canada. This will enable comparison between the model SWE estimates at the field sites as a function of the two types of input data. Then the project will assess how remote sensing estimates can improve the model using a data assimilation method, especially when run with the CRCM. Snow surveys conducted during the winter seasons will form an integral part of this proposal and will facilitate testing of the remote sensing and model SWE estimates.",Environment,Environment,Geography,"Kelly, Richard","RGPIN ","Remote sensing","Geographical information","Information g�ographique",3-5

"As a comparative physiologist/endocrinologist, I am interested in how animals ""work"". My research program is focused on how the endocrine system regulates salt and water balance in aquatic vertebrates such as fishes. Like all animals, fishes must maintain ""homeostasis"" (i.e. internal stability). When circulating salt (i.e. ion) levels are out of balance, either through natural alterations in environmental conditions or through environmental disturbance, the endocrine system regulates the reinstatement of homeostasis. This occurs through the action of hormones on tissues that regulate the transfer of water and salt between the animal body and the surrounding environment. These tissues include the kidney, gastrointestinal tract and skin. In fishes, the gills are also particularly important because they directly interface with surrounding water. These aforementioned tissues are referred to as epithelia and they each establish a barrier that separates two fluid compartments. In the case of the gill, these two compartments are the body and the surrounding water. Epithelial tissue regulates the movement of ions and water either across the cells (transcellular) or between the cells (paracellular). While a lot of research has been conducted in order to understand the movement of ions across cells, very little has been done in order to understand what regulates the movement of ions between cells. This is surprising because the permeability of the paracellular route is controlled by the tight junction (TJ) complex and TJs are widely acknowledged to be very important in the general physiology of all vertebrate organisms. My work over the coming grant cycle will focus on gaining a much better understanding of the ""machinery"" that regulates the permeability of the TJ in fishes and how it is controlled by the endocrine system. With NSERC support I have already demonstrated that some of the proteins that comprise the TJ complex are very sensitive to environmental change and I hypothesize that TJ proteins play an extremely important role in the general well-being of aquatic organisms and ultimately our aquatic ecosystems.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Biology,"Kelly, Scott","RGPIN ","Animal physiology and metabolism","Animal biology","Biologie animale",1-5

"Lameness is one of the most important health and welfare challenges to the dairy industry. Economic losses due to lameness can be very significant, and the cost of lameness has been estimated at $9000 per 100 cows per year. Both techniques for the identification oflameness and the genetic factors predisposing animals to lameness warrant further investigation.

The objectives of this study are two-fold. The over-arching objective is to examine the genetic correlations between various measures of lameness, including farm recorded health events, type classification scores, hoof trimming observations and pedometric measurements, as indirect measures of lameness. Data from routine hoof trimming reports, Holstein Canada classification reports, the National Health Project, and on-farm automated activity monitoring devices will be evaluated, validated where necessary and used to examine both phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of dairy cattle lameness. The second objective of this study is to determine if automated activity monitoring using accelerometers (also known as pedometers), can accurately identify and predict lameness events in dairy cattle. The accuracy of the Pedometry Plus (Pedo-Plus, S.A.E. Afikim, Israel) will be validated on approximately 500 cows in several Canadian dairy herds. Each cow will be fitted with a Pedo-Plus monitor, hoof trimmed to identify existing lameness causing hoof lesions, and gait scored. At approximately four week intervals, hoof trimmers will examine the hooves. New cases of lameness will be noted and the activity records of cows with new lesions will be examined to determine activity patterns indicative of lameness. Expected outcomes of this study are validated tools that can be used for on-farm lameness detection and opportunities to address lameness through genetic improvement.","Agriculture and primary food production","Agriculture and primary food production","Population Medicine","Kelton, David","CRDPJ ","Population genetics",Genetics,"G�n�tique",1-3
"The proposed mathematical research program includes applications specific to biological and industrial control that both involve research into control over shared networks.



The biological component is to understand how reflected waves may be relevant in control of cardiac output.

This problem will be tackled using a mixture of mathematical modelling of wave reflections in pulsatile

networks with approximate solutions developed by semi-analytic means and asymptotic expansions. Wave

reflections occur when the pulsatile blood flow encounters arterial bifurcations and as such carry information

about the fluid mechanical and structural status of the entire arterial tree back up to the aorta. In recent work by

the principal applicant and colleagues, the concept of `smart' baroreception was presented. There, the

sensitivity of aortic stretch receptors to change in global arterial tree characteristics was measured. The next

proposed steps are to understand how global arterial blood flow and pressure may be inferred via wave

reflections and then to build a closed-loop neural control model as a canonical demonstration of `smart'

baroreception. The biomedical importance of `smart' baroreception is that arterial wall stiffening followed by

sympathetic neural compensation may be a component in the onset of essential hypertension.



The industrial component is for analysis of predictive control of fast processes over shared networks. This

problem will involve the programming and use of a network simulator, mathematical analysis and design of

robust predictive control methods along with the simulation and testing of network protocols subject to

nonstationary communication delays. The aim is to provide remote control of manufacturing processes based

on a predictive control design that is robust with respect to communication delays coupled with a network

protocol designed to allow a controller to adequately compensate for such delays.

"One basic cellular strategy underlying resistance to foreign chemicals is to reduce intracellular concentrations. One of the most intriguing defense strategies developed is the activity of the multixenobiotic resistance mechanism (MXR), analogous to the multidrug resistant (MDR) mechanism found in mammalian cell lines and tumors of human patients resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. MXR activity is mediated by the expression of a variety of transmembrane transport proteins, the most common among them being the transmembrane P-glycoprotein, a multidrug resistance transporter (ABCB1). 

Although mammalian information on the structure-function relationship of P-gp has been generated in recent years, we still do not know how it works as an efflux pump or about its role in normal physiology (particularly in teleosts).  A role for P-gp certainly exists in altering the pharmacokinetics of natural endogenous compounds and xenobiotics.  Still, considerable controversy on its mechanism of action and function in normal cells exists.  Through their maintenance, regulation and activity, cellular defense mechanisms such as P-gp can incur energetic costs to an organism.  The impact of active xenobiotic cell defense on energy budgets is largely unknown and has been limited to research on biotransformation. 

This research has several specific aims: 1) to assess the physiological and pharmacological roles of P-gp, 2) begin to elucidate the mechanisms of P-gp and possibly other ABC transporters, 3) increase knowledge of the teleost P-gp substrate base and activities in teleosts, 4) to investigate the relationship between P-gp activity and biotransformation and other xenobiotic/metabolite transporters, and 5) to determine specific energetic costs of P-gp-mediated efflux.

"Pictures are one of our most effective ways to communicate information. But their uses remain mysterious and their potential is still unknown. How do we perceive and represent 3D space? Remarkably, blind people use perspective to solve this problem, not just the sighted. But how? Both vision and touch must have a way of responding to the features of perspective pictures. Vision is often correct in estimating the shape of middle-distance objects sitting on the ground. But since the geometry of perspective was first devised it has been obvious that there are striking limits to the perspective pictures that perception can handle. Distant tiles on a floor can look stubby. Tiles on the sides of pictures can look very stretched; that is, on the margins of perfect perspective pictures, forms appear distorted, highly distended. This is why cameras for everyday only use contain narrow-angle lenses, not wide-angle lenses that reveal the marginal distortions. These effects may all be caused by perception's underestimation of foreshortening. The same effects may occur in touch, as well as vision, as sighted-blindfolded and truly blind people point to a row of objects receding into the distance. 

Also, the directions people in pictures seem to be facing may be similar in vision and touch. This has practical applications for signs giving directions.  

Further, blind people may be able to expand the potential of pictures by inventing metaphors for things that cannot be depicted literally -- tastes of hot peppers, birds chirping, for example. Their metaphors may work well for the sighted!

Besides giving accurate impressions, pictures create illusions. We have trouble reading the forms that are physically present on a picture's surface. Many of these effects may be due to perspective. These mistakes in perception may help explain why many of us have trouble learning to draw.

"The market for Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS) is saturated and excess stillage is a waste problem to the bioethanol industry. Stillage handling is one of the major limitations of the corn to ethanol process, since DDGS drying and stillage evaporation account for approximately 30.3 and 16.5% of total process energy consumption, respectively. Each litre of ethanol can generate up to 20L of stillage with total chemical oxygen demand of (TCOD 100-200 g/L), and thin stillage evaporator condensate is the largest wastewater contributor. Although anaerobic digestion (AD) has lower alkalinity and nutrient requirements compared to aerobic biodegradation and has  great potential to reduce the organic pollution of stillage and produce methane as fuel for the bioethanol plant, it has not been applied with the magnitude possible. Studies to date focus on digestion of thin stillage, leaving the majority of the methane potential of the stillage untreated. However, if whole stillage (3-5 times more concentrated than thin stillage) can be treated directly in AD at practical solid reaction times (SRT) bypassing evaporation and drying it could make existing and new bioethanol facilities energy-independent while solving a major bottle neck and waste problem. Establishment of this technology would also open international markets for Canadian industry. The main objective of this research is to study the biodegradation performance and kinetics [biogas production, TCOD, total solid (TS) and volatile solids (VS) removal efficiencies] of whole and thin stillage using batch and continuous-flow AD under both thermophilic, mesophilic and temperature phased digestion (TPAD) (thermophilic/mesophilic or mesophilic/thermophilic;T/M vs M/T) conditions.",Engineering,"Advancement of knowledge","Civil Engineering","Kennedy, Kevin","RGPIN ","Environmental engineering","Environmental engineering","G�nie de l'environnement",2-5

reactivity in biology. We are extending this approach to address important questions about the sulfur, selenium,

defined important differences in the electronic structure of N-heterocyclic carbenes as compared to phosphines

as neutral donor ligands in catalysis. We are exploring the extent of these differences and their effect on

"The behaviour of systems containing large numbers of interacting classical or quantum particles can be dramatically different from the behaviour of individual constituent particles.  As succinctly summarised by Nobel Laureate P.W. Anderson, ""More is different"".  I will investigate collective effects that arise from the interactions of large numbers of particles in three classes of physical system: disordered, strongly correlated electron materials;  ultra-cold atomic gases and trapped ions; and glass formers. Many technologically promising materials, such as high temperature superconductors, magnetic semiconductors, and colossal magnetoresistance manganites derive their useful properties from the strong correlations between electrons and its interplay with intrinsic imperfections, disorder, in their structure. I will develop theoretical approaches that will lead to new insights into electronic states of these materials.  Ultra-cold atomic gases are the coldest matter ever realised, with temperatures of nanokelvins above absolute zero, and there has been much excitement about the possibility of using these systems, or trapped ions, as a platform for manipulating quantum information and creating a quantum computer.  The ability to manipulate these systems in real time leads to the possibility of observing out of equilibrium and dissipative effects that I will study theoretically.  Glassiness presents a complex theoretical problem, as it involves the co-operative relaxation of very large numbers of microscopic units. There is a growing consensus that local arrangements of atoms or molecules in glassy systems play a pivotal role in their macroscopic behaviour, but this relationship is not well understood -- I will develop theoretical approaches that can shed light on the connections between microscopic particle motion and macroscopic relaxations. The results from these projects will provide new insights and theoretical approaches to these systems and will give indications about possible future avenues for research, contributing to the strong Canadian research communities in these areas, especially in strongly correlated electron systems and cold atoms and trapped ions.

"Many issues confront modern IC designers: (1) circuits are large and require scalable algorithms; (2) different design styles are available, including ASICs, structured ASICs, and FPGAs; (3) designs have multiple objectives including wire length, routability and timing. Placement remains a pivotal step in physical design; it consumes significant run-time and largely determines the overall interconnect. Placement has enjoyed a renaissance in research activity in recent years.  The intent of this proposal to improve upon the state-of-the-art in placement for ASIC, structured ASIC, and FPGA design styles.

ASIC and structured ASIC placers make approximations to achieve efficiency.  Inaccurate models are used to approximate interconnect and placers may not reserve enough resources for routing. A circuit may be unroutable and design iterations may be required to converge to a feasible  solution of good quality.  The objective of the first part of this proposal is to improve ASIC and structured ASIC placement by: (1) developing fast and scalable techniques for global routing which are capable of handling congestion and blockages; and (2) integrating global routing into our previously-developed placement technology that will result in higher quality placements which are routable.

FPGAs have predefined routing structures that are designed to be routable. The emphasis in FPGA placement is on achieving better timing. The second part of our proposal will improve FPGA placement by:

(1) investigating smart move generation during placement which will yield higher quality placements with less run-time; and (2) improving packing for cluster-based devices that will also improve results.

This research will yield new and novel results that will improve upon the current state-of-the-art in placement for different design styles.

"In recent years several studies have suggested that a disturbance in body core temperature regulation occurs following the cessation of exercise.  In the post-exercise period the levels of skin blood flow and sweating return to resting levels despite a persistent elevation in body core temperature, suggesting an alteration in thermoregulatory control.  Recent work has shown that non-thermal factors, associated with hemodynamic changes post-exercise may influence the regulation of body core temperature during exercise recovery.  A compromised thermoregulatory response following physical exertion is of considerable concern within a working environment due to the associated increased risk of post-exertional heat-related injury.  My research program is aimed at 1) understanding the etiology of the post-exercise disturbance in thermal homeostasis; and 2) evaluating the possible thermal and non-thermal factors which may contribute to this prolonged hyperthermic state. The proposed studies will be directed at investigating the separate and integrated influences of thermal and non-thermal factors on body core temperature regulation during single and intermittent bouts of exercise; and as a function of different biomedical factors which could alter this response (i.e., sex, age, physical fitness, heat acclimation).   The design of this research program is unique in its attempt to characterize the integrated responses of simultaneous thermal and non-thermal reflexes by directly measuring the individual components of heat production and heat loss using a whole-body calorimeter.  Studying the physiological responses elicited involuntarily by the human body to promote the dissipation of heat and directly measuring the subsequent heat exchange to the environment via calorimetry, will allow a better understanding of how heat stress develops.  This will potentially allow for earlier prediction of its onset.  Further, by considering the relative influence of biomedical characteristics affecting heat balance, we will also be able to develop a more comprehensive risk assessment data that could be used to validate existing predictive heat stress models that would be more tailored to the individual.

"The objective is to leverage the TV and Radio advertisement detection technology developed at CRIM to develop prototypes for advertisement detection products and services. These products and services have a very wide applicability. For example, they can be used by TV stations for monitoring ads and for indexing broadcasts, by CRTC for monitoring compliance of ads, by advertisement companies and other businesses for monitoring the airing of their ads on TV and radio broadcasts. We have developed advertisement detection system that accurately monitors specific ads using audio only. It can also detect arbitrary ads with over 96% recall and over 92% precision. The same algorithms can be used to detect copying of copyrighted audio (songs etc.) in peer-to-peer transfer over the internet.



Currently, this technology works off-line on recorded audio of the broadcasts. The algorithms are completely automated, and can be applied to both TV and radio broadcasts. We need to test the algorithms on much larger data from all over US and Canada to verify the performance. We will also optimize the computing speed of the algorithms for searching both known ads and new ads. The algorithms that find new ads are novel, but we need to show that they perform well for all kinds of programs with reasonable computing requirements. Evaluating the robustness of the algorithms on data from all over North America is necessary in order to attract funding for technology transfer from potential companies in this business.

"Two of the principal problems in speech technology

are speaker recognition (who is speaking?) and speech

recognition (what is being said?). These problems

have resisted solution because of the numerous types

of variability in speech. For example, the performance of

speaker recognition systems degrades as a result

of channel and microphone effects and careful modeling

is needed to distinguish these nuisance effects from aspects

of the speech signal which are useful in discriminating

between speakers. In speech recognition on the other hand,

variation between

speakers is considered to be a nuisance and the only type of variability

which is of real interest is phonetic variability.

This proposal is concerned with developing new 

statistical methods of modeling speaker and channel variation using

`hidden variables' which I call speaker and channel factors.

The techniques that I am developing are purely statistical so

it is hard to say exactly what the hidden variables represent but

it is reasonable to surmise that they capture features such as

a speaker's age and sex, electrical noise in transmission channels and

ordinary background acoustic noise.","Computer software","Information and communication services","Head Office","Kenny, Patrick","RGPIN ","Electrical and electronic engineering","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",3-5

"One route to achieving better computer performance is to attach peripheral boards with reconfigurable hardware units. By configuring the chip appropriately, one can provide a complete System-on-Chip solution that is optimal for a given set of factors. (i.e. cost and time to market). To improve performance, the most CPU-intensive parts of the program can be compiled into a custom hardware solution for a programmable device. If communication overhead is kept under control, the result should be a speed improvement as well as a reduction in development time.

   However, the challenges for anyone attempting to implement such a mixed software-hardware solution are enormous. The programming languages, the compilers, the simulation tools and the run-time monitoring tools all provide woefully inadequate assistance. In general, the tools rely heavily on an expert system designer to guide and direct the process. The payoffs would be enormous if development tools could guide the process and make effective use of a hybrid microporcessor - configurable unit platform.

   I propose to work on the following aspects of the problem:

1) Decomposing a program into those components which are best suited to be sped up by a configurable hardware implementation, and those remaining components which are best handled by traditional software.

2) Developing programming language constructs and techniques which facilitate #1.

3) Enhancing existing compilers to support the new programming language constructs.

4) Developing simulation tools which wil enable program decompositions to be tested and evaluated.

   Assorted applications available from my previous work relating to computational biology, co-designed virtual machines, and logic synthesis will be used to validate the proposed research.

"Introduction: The human retina is comprised of neurons that relay visual information to the brain. An effective distribution of oxygen to the different layers of the retina is required to support their structural and functional integrity. The retinal and choroidal vasculatures insure proper oxygen distribution to neural tissue. Oxygen delivery to a tissue is strongly dependent on the arterial oxygen concentration. Experimentally, it is possible to modify the arterial oxygen level by modifying the oxygen or carbon dioxide concentrations in inspired air. Objective: To quantify changes in the responsiveness of retinal neurons and their blood supply to carefully controlled changes in the normal concentration of oxygen in blood. Scientific approach: The bio-electrical responses representing the activity of the principal retinal neurons will be monitored non-invasively through the flash electroretinogram a-wave, b-wave and oscillatory potentials, as well as the pattern evoked electroretinogram. Global and focal blood flow in the retina, and blood flow in discrete vessels and capillary beds will be recorded with dedicated systems. These measurements will be carried out during alterations in the degree of oxygenated arterial blood. Expected significance: This research will provide new insights into the dependence of normal retinal function on the degree of oxygenation in the blood perfusing the anatomically distinct retinal layers. This knowledge is essential if we are to understand the vascular role in retinal diseases, particularly those associated with retinal ischemia.

"Apoptosis has gained significant importance in human diseases and its clinical management. Failure to regulate apoptosis is a common feature in several diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and AIDS. Hence, it is important to understand the apoptotic processes in order to devise therapeutic means to intervene and reset the balance between cell survival and death. The objective of this research program is to gain an understanding of apoptosis using nanoparticle-conjugated biomarkers. The methodology relies on the modification of solid surfaces with biomolecules (cells, peptides and enzymes) followed by the detection using electrochemical (cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and optical (fluorescence spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance) techniques. The research program includes interlinked sub-projects, which involve the detection of the apoptosis-induced changes that occur at the plasma membrane and the activation of caspases in the cytoplasm. The expected results should lead to the development of an analytical approach to the biological chemistry of apoptosis. By better understanding apoptosis pathways, novel therapeutic agents may be developed to induce death in cancerous cells. From the analytical approach proposed here, it will be possible to assign and elucidate the majority of functional biomolecules in apoptosis and provide information regarding cellular reactivity, and interactions with nanomaterials. The research plan will provide unique opportunities for the elucidation of nanomaterials and their interactions with biomolecules, and such analytical approaches are crucial, if we are to eventually understand the effect of nanomaterials in living systems on a global scale.

"Whole plants and cultured plant cells are potentially one of the most economical systems for large-scale production of recombinant proteins for industrial and pharmaceutical uses. As the demand for biological drugs increases as predicted, efficient production, in terms of cost and volume, will be critical to meet the rising demand. In the near future, some of the current production systems for generating recombinant proteins for therapeutic purposes will need to be replaced by safer, and more cost-efficient, production systems. Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) and Gaucher disease are inherited lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). The former is characterized by a deficiency of an enzyme called alpha-L-iduronidase; in severely affected humans this genetic disease leads to death in early childhood because of profound skeletal, cardiac and neurological disturbances. Purified enzyme is an effective means to restore lysosomal enzyme deficiency. Thus, LSDs, that collectively represent over 50 disorders, are amenable to enzyme replacement therapies (ERT). However, the current methods used to commercially produce recombinant lysosomal enzymes for this purpose, most commonly mammalian cell cultures, are prohibitively costly. Because of this, financial support for ERT on affected Canadians is doubtful. We are using plants as hosts to produce human enzymes toward developing more economical treatments for MPS I and Gaucher disease, and to serve as a general platform for plant production of therapeutic proteins. As well as testing the therapeutic efficacy of our plant-derived enzymes, as a long-term goal, we will establish an in vivo plant-based system for assessing the efficacy of pharmacological chaperones and other small molecules as LSD therapies. This project brings together a unique International team of researchers that have expertise in the genetic basis, pathophysiology, and treatment of human LSDs, protein glycosylation within the context of medicinal chemistry, and recombinant protein production in plants.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Biological Sciences","Kermode, Allison","STPGP ","Molecular biology","Molecular biology","Biologie mol�culaire",3-3
"The agricultural and forest industries rely upon seeds that exhibit high germinability and vigorous, synchronous growth after germination. However, these industries encounter problems related to poor seed quality and persistent dormancy. For example, the seeds of certain conifer (tree) species such as yellow-cedar develop pronounced dormancy, exhibiting a low capacity for germination upon dispersal. We have defined some of the mechanistic factors that underlie the dormancy and quality of conifer seeds, and have developed tools for improving conifer seed germination and seedling growth. However, our most striking discoveries are those concerning the germination inhibitor abscisic acid (ABA), and a protein called ABI3, which helps to relay ABA signals. ABI3 proteins control many events that are critical to seed survival. This includes the deposition of food reserves, dormancy imposition and the acquisition of a tolerance of seed tissues to desiccation. We have isolated the ABI3 gene from yellow-cedar (CnABI3) and have defined some of the functions of this protein. In addition, we have identified three yellow-cedar proteins that interact with CnABI3, and further have made the exciting discovery that CnABI3 may play a role in the regulation of flowering. In trees and other plant species, the ABI3 protein may function as a global regulator, acting to regulate all key transitions of the plant lifecycle. However, the mechanisms underlying the multiple functions of this protein are not fully understood. Our objectives are: (1) To further our understanding of the role and mechanisms of (Cn)ABI3 as a 'gatekeeper' of important transitions of the plant lifecycle and (2) To investigate the role of (Cn)ABI3 as a safeguard in stress conditions. This research will uncover novel findings at a mechanistic level of the role of ABI3 in plants and seeds and will have significance to forestry and agriculture, in which seed quality, seedling vigour and the ability to resist stresses are of utmost importance.

"Plant roots are colonized by a diverse array of fungi. These include not only detrimental pathogens, but also beneficial species which improve plant growth. Still others exist as ""endophytes"" within the plant root tissue, which do not cause disease symptoms or form the structures normally found in beneficial associations. Root endophytic fungi are often abundant and found on almost all plants so far studied, yet their cryptic nature has constrained investigation into their role in the ecology of the soil environment. Root endophytic fungi potentially represent an undiscovered source of biodiversity. Not only have previous studies of fungal root endophytes uncovered high levels of diversity, but the endophytic fungi of leaves (the above-ground analogy) are thought to be ""hyperdiverse"". Modern DNA based detection techniques are far more sensitive than those previously employed, and should reveal the true diversity of these unseen organisms.

The function of fungal root endophytes is also poorly understood. Some species are ""latent pathogens"" which will eventually elicit disease symptoms. Others are likely to be involved in beneficial relationships with their hosts in that they may return a ""service"" to the plant. This may be in the form of protection against detrimental soil organisms or improvement of plant nutrient uptake. Fungal root endophytes may also connect the roots of trees to the roots of plants growing in their understories, allowing for their benefits to be shared.

The main objective of the proposed research is to improve our understanding of the diversity and function of the root endophytic fungi. The work will specifically target fungal root endophytes of boreal forest trees, due to the potential for high endophyte diversity and inter-plant connections. The information gathered will further our understanding of fundamental below-ground processes critical to the health of the boreal forest and should be of interest to forest ecologists and managers. Throughout its timeframe, the proposed research will engage two graduate and five undergraduate student research assistants in all aspects of the work, including data analyses, conference presentations and publication opportunities.

"Human activities are changing climate, modifying habitats, facilitating species invasions, and spreading pollution. These global changes have brought about a new era of mass extinction. Macroecology seeks predictions of species diversity and abundance at spatial scales commensurate with many of the expected biological impacts of global change. With improved prediction and understanding emerging from research of this nature, it may be possible to reduce extinction rates. 

  This proposal seeks rapid progress on three main, long term research objectives, including both pure and applied research elements: 

1)    )	To advance pure macroecology by developing and testing new ideas about how species respond to climate and habitat conditions over geographical gradients and through time,

2)    )	To take advantage of pseudo-experimental opportunities provided by global change to test and strengthen macroecological ideas, and

3)    )	To use stronger macroecological ideas to solve pressing conservation problems, such as how to recover endangered species in Canada, or to conserve species despite the dangerous threats of climate and land use changes.

  Our work builds on new syntheses of macroecology and global change biology to test evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that could explain the widely observed link between climate and species diversity (the species richness-energy hypothesis). Our work will also provide new techniques and tests of this theory as a tool to predict how climate and land use changes could affect biodiversity in the future by demonstrating how it has affected biodiversity over the 20th century. Scientific discoveries made here provide the historical calibration necessary to forecast the future of biodiversity. This work includes policy-relevant applications that will provide highly qualified personnel with advanced and well-rounded training.

"Our research group is engaged in the development of new and useful synthetic organic reactions and the application of these reactions to the synthesis of complex bioactive molecules. In the past decade or so we have a) discovered a fundamentally new cycloaddition reaction, b)  developed a convenient method for the synthesis of complex indoles, c) found new ways of functionalizing heterocyclic systems, d) expanded the chemistry of donor/acceptor cyclopropanes and e) prepared 16 natural products by total synthesis.



     In this proposal we put forth a plan to build on these accomplishments since many are still quite new and underdeveloped.   We will seek to apply them to more complex synthetic targets in an effort to showcase their utility and to provide useful routes to the target molecules themselves.



    Our research program will be of interest to those in both the medicinal and process chemistry fields.  The problems we solve will be not unlike those encountered in the pharmaceutical industry and the methods we develop will be of great interest to those preparing compounds oftherapeutic value.



    The researchers carrying out the projects within our program will be well trained and highly sought after by companies that rely on chemical synthesis.

"Marine invertebrates have proven to be a prolific source of novel chemical structures which often exhibit intriguing and useful biological activities. For example, gorgonians, a group of corals which are prominent members of tropical and subtropical habitats worldwide, have yielded a large variety of novel bioactive natural products, particularly terpenes. Terpenes exhibit a range of biomedical activities and are extremely valuable for their anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Despite the great potential of such marine natural products in a variety of applications, the development of these compounds has been hampered by the lack of an available supply. This limited supply is generally considered to be a significant impediment in the transformation of a marine natural product into a commercial entity.  

The research project described in this proposal is a part of a larger research program which aims to develop a sustainable production method of fuscol and fuscosides, a family of potent anti-inflammatory terpenes from a gorgonian coral. This specific project builds on our past experience and is designed to develop key components of two complementary production methods of the fuscosides.  If successful, this project will also lay the groundwork for production methods of a wide variety of marine-derived terpenes with numerous applications. Our general approach is to produce a key intermediate through heterologous expression of a key biosynthetic gene and complete the production of known and new analogues of fuscosides via synthesis.   Thus, successful completion of this project will help facilitate the development of a wide range of terpenoid marine natural products with therapeutic activity that otherwise may not be developed.  This will be of benefit to the health of the Canadian public.

"NSERC 101 Summary



It is not known whether the continents formed early in Earth's history, or alternatively grew steadily through time. Ocean crust is continuously formed and recycled into the deep mantle by plate tectonics. Plumes of anomalously hot rock are ejected from Earth's core-mantle boundary at 3000 km depth and erupt to form small volcanic islands like Hawaii or large ocean plateaus such as Iceland. By sampling rocks from ancient ocean islands and plateaus of various ages, preserved in the geological record, it will be possible to answer the question when continents were extracted from the mantle by plate tectonics. The significance of this research is that mineral resources form in continental crust of specific ages, so it is important to understand how and when the continents formed.



A second part of the research will address the question of where Earth's oceans and atmosphere came from. Earth's primary ocean and atmosphere were lost during the giant meteorite impact event that created the Earth-Moon system. Our present oceans and atmosphere must have been acquired after that impact, possibly from volcanic gases, meteorites, or comets, each of which has distinct nitrogen-isotope signatures. Nitrogen from Earth's atmosphere is captured by microorganisms, and buried in sedimentary rocks as nitrogen rich hydrocarbon. By analyzing hydrocarbons for nitrogen-isotopes in ancient rocks of various ages it will be possible to answer the question of where Earth's ocean-atmosphere came from.

"Good forest management requires good management tools and good forest inventory data. Efficient design of forest inventories requires decisions regarding the number and spatial arrangement of sampling units as well as the type of sampling unit utilized.  For most forest inventories in Canada, Bitterlich's angle count sampling (ACS) is used. ACS coupled with efficient subsampling of trees for detailed stem measurements is generally cost-effective and less prone to measurement bias and error than other commonly employed sampling units. In this proposal, ACS is applied to 360-degree panoramic photographs.  Image analysis algorithms are proposed that will automate the detection and measurement of trees and field sampling techniques to correct for count biases due to hidden trees are proposed.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Forestry and Environmental Management, Faculty of","Kershaw, JohnA","RGPIN ","Forest management","Forest engineering","G�nie forestier",1-1

"The persistence of man-made chemicals in the biosphere and in our bodies is becoming a major global health issue for our planet and for us. The vast majority of organic chemicals are made from depleting (non-renewable) feedstocks. Chemists and, importantly, chemical companies have begun actively searching for greener alternatives to their current manufacturing practices.  This includes preparing new materials from sustainable resources and can lead to the production of biodegradable, less toxic products. Recent advances in green chemistry techniques mean there is a new toolbox available for the manipulation of molecules, whereby the environmentally benign nature of the chemicals' origin will not be significantly reduced in their processing. Thus, the products ultimately available to the public will have a lower burden on the environment in many respects. It should be noted that chemical feedstocks need not compete with food sources and can use by-products or waste materials as their feed. Our research group is performing 'blue skies' research in this area.  One approach to this is to reduce the energy needed and the waste produced in chemical manufacture by using catalysts. Reactions of particular interest include the catalytic transformation of renewable feedstocks e.g. the controlled degradation of biopolymers such as chitin and lignin.  In addition to catalyst development, we are also investigating synthetic methods based on 'greener' alternative solvents (e.g. water and carbon dioxide) and unconventional activation methods (e.g. microwave assisted syntheses). Students in the Kerton group receive training in organic, inorganic and polymer synthesis/characterization methods, and obtain an excellent grounding in the rapidly growing field of green chemistry, which should be transferable to many fields of chemistry and related technologies (e.g. materials and biotechnology).

"The importance of information availability and Internet is clearly evident in many areas, from a personal level to a general society effect, such as in economy, health care, or scientific research. While general search engines seem to provide a frequently satisfactory document and site retrieval, based on short ad-hoc queries, there is still an enormous time-consuming manual effort required to gather data, filter it, organize it, and use it in the actual tasks that a user wants to get accomplished.  Here, we propose to develop three different core natural language processing methodologies that will make a strong contribution to solving this information management problem.  Beside the theoretical results, we develop several tools that actually implement designed solutions, and we also apply these methodologies and tools to specific application areas.

    Our focus is on the methods for (1) Common N-gram analysis, (2) Regular Expression based and finite state processing, and (3) unification-based processing and matching of typed feature structures; with an effort to harmonize these fairly different techniques. The developed software systems include tools for n-gram based text mining (Ngrams.pm and Swordfish), Starfish -- a text preprocessing and embedded programming tool, the question answering system Jellyfish, the system with typed feature structures in Java -- Stefs, and Shrack -- a peer-to-peer system for scientific information dissemination. The application areas include textual mining, authorship attribution, web usage and web content mining, dementia detection of Alzheimer type from spontaneous speech, phylogenetic tree generation, malicious code detection, bio-medical semantic text annotation, and knowledge management in eScience.

    The N-gram model, regular expressions, and unification-base approach have been known concepts in NLP.  The novelty of our approach lies in a specific methodologies developed on top of these models: specific profiling and distance functions used with n-grams, iterative regular expression substitutions, and modifications to classical unification, such as relaxed unification.

"    )	The project will develop a method for the rapid and easily-automated manufacture of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for clean, efficient power generation.  A manufacturing technique will be developed based on a continuous process of plasma spraying in air that is easily scalable for mass production.  This work has the potential to drastically reduce the processing time for manufacture of solid oxide fuel cells from 3 days to 3 minutes - a significant breakthrough that will bring SOFCs closer to widespread commercialization.  The research project also has the potential to lead to additional breakthroughs in improved performance of SOFCs through optimization of their microstructures by plasma spray processing in ways that are extremely difficult or impossible to accomplish using the traditional wet chemical routes that are currently most widely used to produce the fuel cells.  These improvements to SOFC microstructures include electrodes with graded compositions to improve resistance to thermal stresses, and graded porosity and particle sizes to improve efficiency.  These improved microstructures would in turn lead to improvements in lifetime, reliability, and performance of the fuel cells, as well as in processing cost.  More rapid commercialization of fuel cell technology will create opportunities for Canadian industry to benefit from resulting expanded worldwide markets, and will benefit the Canadian and worldwide public with the resulting improvements to air quality and public respiratory health.  It would also extend the lifetime of the limited supply of fossil fuel reserves available worldwide, and would increase energy security by making distributed generation more feasible.  The impacts of climate change, particularly on coastal areas, would also be reduced.  The research proposed herein has the potential to contribute significantly to the realization of great benefits not only to the Canadian economy, but also to create tremendous environmental and health benefits for the Canadian and worldwide public.","Energy storage and conversion","Energy resources","Mechanical and Industrial Engineering","Kesler, Olivera","CRDPJ ","Materials processing","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",2-5

"The great majority of Canada's wild plant species are pollinated by animals, as are many of our crops, especially orchard fruit, oil seeds, and pasture species like clover. As these wild and managed pollinators forage for nectar and pollen, plants can use them as vehicles for the transportation of their pollen from flower to flower. In Canada, our animal pollinators are mainly insects (mostly bees, but also flies, butterflies, and moths) with a few species of hummingbirds also involved. It is now recognized, however, that ecosystems relying on animal pollination are in trouble all around the world because of declining pollinator numbers. This decline reduces the capacity of plants to produce fruits and seeds, and thus threatens ecosystem integrity as well as agricultural productivity. However, little is known about the diversity, abundance, and relative importance of animal pollinators in the functioning of our agricultural and wild ecosystems. The novel, multidimensional, approaches proposed by our Network to study both natural ecosystems and agricultural fields and orchards will generate new insights and much greater understanding of how Canadian plants and pollinators interact, between species and at the complex level of ecosystems and landscapes. One axis of the Network will concentrate on the efficiency and health of managed pollinators such as honeybees. Another will emphasize native pollinators, with the goal of maximizing their effectiveness in agriculture, forestry, and wildlands via habitat management. This research will include coordinated surveys of pollinators and studies on plant breeding and mating systems throughout Canada's ecoregions. A third axis concerns the economics of pollination, especially with regard to food security and climate change. A fourth, smaller emphasis of the Network will focus on pollination by wind among Canadian trees and grasses to test models of pollen dispersal by wind and forecasting useful to foresters and allergy sufferers.

"Our world is mostly moving fluid. Seventy percent of the earth's surface is covered in water, and we live at the bottom of an atmosphere 1 000 km thick.  Life itself depends on blood circulation in our arteries and veins.  Our technology and well-being depends on machines that manipulate or move through fluids. We rely on efficient weather and climate prediction. These fluids are usually turbulent: seemingly chaotic, but also containing large coherent vortices.  Examples include storms, flow over aircraft wings, wind blowing around large buildings, and blood flow through the heart. Although turbulent flows are ubiquitous in nature and technology, they are poorly understood: there is still no theory of turbulence.  We do not even know how to accurately calculate strongly turbulent flows on a computer.



The goal of this research proposal is to develop and exploit a new numerical technique that could enable us to calculate turbulent flows around complicated shapes like airplanes and building,  and in the Earth's oceans and atmosphere.  Our method is based on the mathematics of wavelets, which allows us to zoom in on those parts of the flow with very small scales, while doing less computation on smoother areas. Our numerical approach may also provide the foundation for a wavelet-based theoretical model of turbulence.

"In automated laser cladding, a laser beam melts powder particles and a thin layer of the substrate to create a coating that is directly bonded to the substrate. Through a sensor system, the quality and geometry of the clad is measured in real time and using an intelligent controller, the laser power and the cladding speed will be adjusted to achieve the desired quality and geometry in the deposited layers. In this process, a great variety of materials can be deposited on different substrates to form a coating with a thickness of 0.1 to 3 mm. Thicker coatings and bulk 3-D parts can be produced by a successive layering technique using the automated laser cladding process. The high solidification rates and unique processing conditions of this technique allow the production of materials with improved properties compared to that of conventional processes.

In this project, we intend to use our experience in automated laser cladding to arrive at new coating materials and technologies to fabricate, coat, and repair cutting tools, dies, and high-value machinery parts to improve lifespan and reduce manufacturing and operational costs. The overall objectives of this proposal are:

  - Improvement in laser deposition of Tungsten Carbide (WC) with a Nickel or Cobalt matrix to evenly distribute WC particles in the clads, reduce the thermal stresses in multi layer cladding, and eliminate micro cracks on cladding WC on hard substrates.

  - Development of an in-situ laser powder formation of Titanium Carbide (TiC) on metallic substrates to develop ultra hard surface coatings for tools, dies, and machine parts exposed to extreme wear and corrosion environments 

  - Deposition of diamond matrix composites on body substrates to develop high performance cutting tools and wear resistant materials 

  -  Development of an intelligent closed loop controller to automate the deposition

 The requested funding will be used mainly to support students and training of highly qualified personnel.

In this project a flexible and modular power management optimization platform with embedded simulation and animation capabilities for space rovers is developed. This platform will allow mission and operation planning by minimizing power consumption, mission time, or operation risk. The platform will also allow hardware in the loop testing for evaluating main components used in space rovers. The power management optimization will be based on generation, consumption, and storage devices. Each rover component has its specific characteristics/variables in this platform that can be updated or changed easily. The link between the components will establish the rover configuration and are used when planning/optimizing of a mission on the Moon or on Mars etc is performed. Moreover, the components interactions with environment, i.e., temperature profile, lighting conditions (when having solar panels for recharge), and terrain profile will be considered and modeled for an accurate estimation of the path planning.



This platform will provide support to the mission planner in many aspects including: 

-    )	Optimize the trajectory based on power constraints (e.g., short and steep vs. longer and more level terrain) 

-    )	Optimize the speed of the vehicle base on power constraints for a given trajectory (e.g., driving slow vs. fast through a shady area) 

-    )	Maximize the battery life 

-    )	Mission simulation and visualization

-    )	Hardware in the loop simulation for components testing and evaluation

"The Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology (SIAST) will engage in applied research to develop environmentally sustainable and responsible technologies. This is a joint initiative between SIAST's chemical technology program and two local small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) working to address the province's environmental challenges. These challenges are anticipated to intensify in the next few years due to Saskatchewan's strong economy and population growth. This proposal builds on research expertise established by SIAST's Chemical Technology program through projects with the Saskatchewan Research Council. Our current knowledge capacity gives strength to these new initiatives which link participants to answer a growing need in Saskatchewan for applied research in wastewater remediation. One project will focus on rural challenges (ammonia extraction) and the other will focus on industrial challenges (hydrocarbon removal) to generate cleaner wastewater. both projects address growing provincial environmental concerns, particularly in the southern part of the province where the population is concentrated and fresh water less abundant. The objective of the research is to develop new technologies to reduce water contamination and to create value-added byproducts by recycling the contaminants into a reusable form. The resulting technologies will be employed in municipal wastewater recycling, water purification, sewage treatment, and wastewater management. Laboratory and field research will be conducted to explore the feasibility and viability of the new technologies.","Not available","Not available","Head Office","Khalid, Salim","CCIP  ","Not available","Not available","Non disponible",1-2
"This proposal consists of several rather independent components: the local index formula for twisted spectral triples; an elaborate  study of  Hopf cyclic cohomology; and noncommutative complex geometry.  The notion of a twisted spectral triple has recently been introduced by Connes and Moscovici. It aims to extend the index theory to a type III setting. Here by  type III we mean a situation (as in type III von Neumann  algebras) where the underlying noncommutative space admits no non-zero traces. The twist automorphism  is 

related to the modular automorphism group through a KMS condition. This is the most difficult type of  noncommutative spaces and has no commutative counterpart. The question of a finding a local index formula for the 

Connes-Chern character for    twisted spectral triples is one of our aims in this project. In a different direction I am planing to continue my study of Hopf cyclic cohomology.  This include an extension of the family of Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebras to super geometry and the study of their Hopf cyclic theory, and the study of Hopf cyclic theory for twisted (by a 3-cocycle) quantum double of finite groups and its possible relation with invariants of links and 3 manifolds.  

 In a separate program  we develop and study complex and holomorphic noncommutative geometry.  An  examples which we  carefully study  is the complex structure(s) on the noncommutative (quantum)  2-sphere and flag varieties of quantum groups. There is a notion of a positive cyclic 2-cocycles (due to Connes-Cuntz) that encodes the idea of a  quadratic differential of Riemann surfaces in the noncommutative settings. On the quantum two sphere we 

should look for a twisted version of this positivity condition.  Another  immediate  goal is to find an analogue of Grothendieck's celebrated theorem on 

 the classification of holomorphic bundles on the 2-sphere in holomorphic  noncommutative set up.

"The proposed research program aims to implement inherently safer oil and gas operations through a risk-based approach. This will be achieved by developing advanced methodologies and models to assess and monitor dynamic risk (rather than static risk, studied previously) and by developing corresponding methods to reduce risk by preventing accident occurrence, rather than by only mitigating/limiting their impacts (studied earlier) when they occur. The proposed research will enable cost effective targeted improvements to process safety issues in oil and gas operations. 

Process safety is of paramount importance in the oil and gas industry, as well as other process industries. Significant progress has been made towards safety and risk management; however accidents in process operations are still causing heavy loss of life and property. Recent examples include the major accident in BP's Texas refinery, and the fire in Sarnia. The main causes of these accidents are: lack of understanding of accident occurrence, over reliance on external safety measures, and lack of availability of rigorous tools and techniques to forecast accidents. Addressing these gaps will promote the design of systems that are inherently safer. 

This proposed research work is complementary to the current developments in the region and will provide a source of more in-depth research and development in the field of process safety and loss prevention. The outcome of this research work will include: models for accident forecasting, accident precursor modeling, a tool for dynamic risk assessment, a new methodology enabling inherently safer design and operation, a new knowledge-base expert system for safety management in process industries, and a pool of highly trained qualified personnel for Canada's oil and gas industry. The integration of inherent safety and dynamic risk assessment including improved modeling of accident forecasting and process integrity modeling, makes the proposed research novel, and is important to those involved in the oil and gas industry and government who regulate safety legislation.","Oil, gas and coal","Energy resources","Engineering and Applied Science, Faculty of","Khan, Faisal","RGPIN ","Chemical engineering","Chemical engineering","G�nie chimique",2-5

"Fragile-X Related 1 protein (FXR1P) is an RNA-binding protein that plays a key role in muscle development. This protein is closely related to the Fragile-X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) which when absent in man, is responsible for the Fragile-X syndrome of mental retardation that affects 1 person over 6000 in the general population; thus it has been suggested that in addition to its role in muscle, FXR1P could compensate partially the lack of FMRP in neurons of these patients. Our laboratory has actively contributed over the past years to try to elucidate FXR1P functions. We have observed that in animal models, FXR1P is necessary for the normal development of muscle as it controls the synthesis of proteins specific to this tissue. However, the mRNA targeted by FXR1 as well as its protein partners remain unknown. We are currently analyzing the RNA that are controlled by FXR1P, as well as the protein partners that interact with it using the most powerful techniques available up to date such as Mass spectroscopy, and DNA-Microarray analyses. 

These studies should enable us to understand the role of FXR1P and to find in the future a link between FXR1P expression and muscle development.

"A Hadamard matrix is an optimal square arrangement of 1's and -1's. The optimality property of such matrices make them very convenient for coding purposes. Orthogonal designs are objects which include Hadamard matrices. An old problem predicts the existence of Hadamard matrices subject to a simple restriction on the size of the matrices. There are many problems related to orthogonal designs whose solution may lead to a resolution of this prediction. 



Our research concerns questions of existence for orthogonal designs and Hadamard matrices. These objects are quite rare and hard to find. For example, despite many attempts by other researchers over twenty or more years, only our group finally found a Hadamard matrix of order 428. This event was interesting enough to be reported on popular websites such as Wikipedia.



Orthogonal designs and Hadamard matrices have applications in coding theory and digital communications.

"In the tropics - as in the temperate zone - the present movement towards the use of exotic and transgenic plants and their microsymbionts in human-dominated landscapes, principally to meet the current and future food and fibre production needs, poses both threats and opportunities. The risks associated with this strategy include a reduction in genetic diversity and the pollution of native gene pools. These have the potential to negatively impact populations, communities, and ecosystems. For the next five years, the proposed research program will use genomic techniques to investigate this problematic in Eucalyptus plantations in southern Brazil. The objectives of the proposed research program are to: i) develop robust neutral non-coding and adaptive coding gene markers for Eucalyptus species and their associated ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF); ii) assess the genetic diversity and monitor the movement (gene flow) and impacts of new genes and genomes in exotic populations of Eucalyptus and their ECMF; iii) assess the functional responses in different environments; and iv) develop spatially explicit individual-based simulation models and statistical ecogenomic methods. Ultimately, results from these studies will provide the necessary scientifically sound background information for making informed decisions for biodiversity conservation and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification of exotic/hybrid Eucalyptus forest plantations in the tropics. The results will provide a better understanding of ecosystem function and environmental sustainability at the genetic level (e.g., inter-and intra-specific genetic variation, invasiveness, introgression, reduced fitness and perceived redundancy), particularly within the context of the manipulation of biodiversity in managed landscapes. Applications of genomics for environmental use are of critical importance to Canadian society and to Canada's role in the international arena. The project will involve the training of Ph.D., M.Sc. and B.Sc. summer students in this rapidly developing research area. To address the different components of the project, collaboration with other scientists is anticipated.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Sciences du bois et de la for�t","Khasa, Damase","RGPIN ","Population genetics",Genetics,"G�n�tique",2-5

"Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is an emerging technology that enables the casting of concrete without any mechanical consolidation which would be required when using conventional concrete. This can lead to remarkable reduction of casting time and labour cost and the production of premium concrete products. Although SCC has gained wide acceptance in the precast industry (up to 30% of the market share in North America) some technical issues remain at hand for the use of SCC in the ready-mix industry, which holds the largest segment of concrete construction in Canada. Technical changes remain in daily designs of stable and robust SCC that can be cast in vertical structural sections (columns, elements, bridge piers, etc.) without exerting excessive lateral pressure on the formwork. This is important given the fact that SCC behaves like a liquid and could exert greater lateral pressure on formwork compared to stiffer conventional concrete, with considerable impact on construction cost. SCC can be designed to exhibit a reversible structural build-up (thixotropy) to reduce form pressure and secure greater in-situ homogeneity of the hardened material. Producing highly thixotropic concrete could lead to some surface defects (appearance of construction lift lines and large entrapped air bubbles at formed surfaces) and would necessitate adapting the rheological properties of the concrete to match placement conditions. The objectives of the proposed research program are to (i) develop test protocols to evaluate the reversible structural build-up at rest and special test methods to assess thixotropy in the field; (ii) elucidate mechanisms governing thixotropy; (iii) develop new generation of SCC with adapted thixotopy and superior engineering properties and durability. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop new generation of highly flowable concrete that could revolutionize the construction industry in Canada and beyond. Such concrete can lead to optimization and automation of the construction process, increase the use of innovative designs for complex structures, and secure high-performance construction and repair materials to meet the great challenge of building durable concrete infrastructure in Canada.

"Electronic design automation (EDA) and computer aided design (CAD) tools were the key enablers that allowed the microelectronics industry to flourish into a multi-billion dollar industry world wide, with Canada at the forefront of this revolution. CAD tools have allowed designers to manage the complexity of very large scale designs containing millions of transistors, and to significantly reduce the design cost and time to market. As a result, microelectronic components are currently an increasingly significant part of most consumer products ranging from computers to cars to toaster-ovens, with significant growth expected particularly in personal wireless communications products and digital entertainment products in addition to the traditional desktop/notebook computers. This is due to important technological advances which have resulted in unprecedented opportunities as well as significant challenges. Advances in lithography have lead to smaller device sizes well into the nanometer range with commercial 45nm devices on the horizon. Packaging technology is advancing at a very fast pace in order to address integration, signal integrity and power distribution issues. Finally novel technologies and devices based on nanotechnology, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), opto-electronics technologies and bio/chemical sensors are being integrated with microelectronics in order to form Microsystems with wide ranging potential applications most notably in the biomedical technology area. While these technological advances represent an important opportunity for economic growth, and for improving the lives of Canadians, they also result in a significant increase in the complexity of design. This research program consists of coordinated research activities leading to design automation tools and methodologies for addressing this increasing design complexity with the aim of enabling the Canadian industry to take full advantage of the potential of advanced Microsystems.

"The construction of secure software systems is a major concern due the pervasive nature of these systems in the daily life of people and organisations.   The proposed work aims at providing software developers with sound techniques to assess the security of software families of embedded systems taking into consideration the similarity between the products to  be analysed, and the environment in which they are expected to operate.  The security analysis  of a family of software systems that share a core part (commonality among all the members) is considered.  



We plan to adopt feature algebra to capture security requirements of a software family from several perspectives such as hardware, partner applications, and middleware. We anticipate using information algebra to articulate security constraints.   Towards the end of this project, we intend to develop an algebraic calculus within a composite algebra that is constructed from  both information algebra and feature algebra.  The new calculus  would allow the analysis and the derivation of the requirements specifications of the members of a software family taking into account the security constraints. 



Among the deliverables of the proposed research is a mathematical framework to specify, analyze security requirements for software families, and analyze the impact of any change in the specifications of the software family or of the environment of its members.  Also, we aim at developing a set of tools that can help carry the analysis of the security requirements and that can perform the transformation of the feature model into the  specifications of members of the modelled sofwate family.



The training offered by this project is broad and is  suitable for a wide range of students.

"Sensors are small devices that can sense, compute and communicate. They can be used in conjunction with actuators that act upon real world objects. They are usually organized into wireless sensors and actuator networks (WSAN). They provide ambient information and act upon the ambient world. Ambient information refers to any collected information that is relevant to the situation of an end-user, e.g. location, velocity, blood pressure, heartbeat, luminosity and temperature. The IP Multimedia Sub-system (IMS) on the other hand is the main component of 3G telecommunication networks. It consists of an overlay control layer that enables the seamless delivery of IP multimedia services via the packet switched domain. It is access agnostic and made up of two layers.. The control layer comprises databases, signaling entities, media handling entities and inter-working entities. The application layer on the other hand consists of entities for enabling valued added services and provides capabilities.

WSANs have been so far designed and deployed in islands with little consideration to the existing telecommunications infrastructure, including IMS. Telecommunication capabilities that could have been re-used are sometimes re-designed from scratch. Other capabilities that could be used to provide more versatile value added services are not used at all. The ambient information available so far in IMS is limited to a very basic form of spatial information, although a much richer set of ambient information is the key to more valuable multimedia services. Furthermore, there is no actuation capability at all. This research proposal aims at investigating the integration of sensing and actuation capabilities of WSAN with IMS in order to enable and provide richer and novel value added services. Business models supporting this integration will be researched as well as architectural frameworks for integrating sensing and actuation functions. Validation of such architectures will be conducted through prototyping, simulation and formal analysis.

"The aim of this application is to establish a state-of-the-art optical characterization facility.  The proposed facility is capable of measuring the specular (direct) and diffuse transmittance and reflectance of materials from the ultraviolet region of the spectrum to the near-infrared.  This facility will augment existing fabrication and characterization tools in the Emerging Communications Technology Institute (ECTI), the first of its kind in Canada, an inter-disciplinary, inter-faculty open research institute based at the University of Toronto.  ECTI operates two state-of-the-art cleanrooms which provides users with access to thin-film deposition, reactive-ion etching, photolithography, spectral ellipsometry, and semiconductor characterization tools.  



It is expected that the proposed facility will support the research of approximately 200 users every year and will be utilized in a broad range of research programs including solar energy, nanotechnology, and photonics.  By providing researchers in these fields with a state-of-the-art optical characterization facility, higher quality devices can be fabricated which will keep Canada in the forefront in these fields.  In addition, the proposed facility will provide graduate and undergraduate students with a high level of training in optical characterization and thus increase the skill set of these individuals soon to enter the Canadian workforce.

The main objective of the proposal is to find a closer link between infinite-dimensional groups, the associated with them variational principles, their geometry, and the dynamical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom. Such links have proved to be important for applications in many areas of science ranging from quantum mechanics to meteorology.  The two long-term objectives of the proposal are:

-- to find universal variational principles for infinite-dimensional groups and semigroups, which could

describe both smooth and singular solutions to many equations of mathematical physics, and

-- to develop connections of gauge theories on complex manifolds with Hamiltonian systems and actions, with dynamical cocycles, and with higher holomorphic link invariants.



The novelty of my approach is to consider the interplay of three domains: fluid dynamics, optimal mass transport, and generation of shock waves from a common point of view. Recent advances in mass transport merged with the group-theoretic insight into hydrodynamics and the new variational approach to shocks give a chance to a progress in several long standing problems, such as for example the long-time existence vs. singularity problems in fluids. I also plan to extend this research to subriemannian geometry and to include infinite-dimensional nonholonomic systems. In another direction, I intend to apply a recent discovery originating in my work in the 90's of the ""real-complex"" correspondence between the topological and holomorphic gauge theories to such diverse areas as the study of dynamical cocycles and complex Vassilliev knot invariants. The study of real versions of these structures are central problems in dynamical systems and knot theory, and it is natural to expect even a richer structure to emerge in the holomorphic settings.

"The last decade has witnessed a rapid growth of information technology in nearly every aspect of life. Powerful personal computers, high bandwidth Internet connections and wireless networking technologies have revolutionized the infrastructure systems on which personal and national economies and many other critical operations depend. It is therefore of utmost importance to ensure safety and security of these systems. The evolving nature of modern communication and infrastructure systems pose several unique security challenges that cannot be addressed by traditional cryptographic techniques. 



The proposed research program aims at addressing some of these challenges by using insights from information and coding theory. The primary focus areas of research will be biometric systems and wireless networks. Biometric technologies are increasingly used for authentication and identification purposes. A number of appliances such as laptops, ATM Machines and E-Passports support biometric-based authentication. Unfortunately many of these systems store the enrollment biometric without any prior encrypton, leaving the system open to potentially hazardous attacks. This research project will use ideas from distributed source coding to develop a  prototype system that  requires only a hash of the enrollment biometric to be stored. The technical challenges that will be addressed include design of better compression codes, pre-processing of biometric systems and improved low-complexity decoding algorithms. The second area of research is wireless security.  The goal of this project is to use resources at the physical layer, such as multiple antennas, power control, channel state information and error correction codes to design protocols that can be resistant to such threats. This project will develop both theoretical analysis to establish fundamental limits as well as practical protocols that result from this study.

"Strain Rate Effects for Design of Steel Structures

In the seismic design requirements of the Canadian steel structures design standard, some elements in the structure are designated to undergo large deformation in order to dissipate the energy from an earthquake. As a result, it is necessary to determine the magnitude of the forces required to deform these elements so that other elements in the structure can be designed not to fail prematurely. The magnitude of these forces can be affected by the rate of deformation in the designated energy dissipating elements because the strength of steel normally increases with the deformation rate. Currently, there is no provision in the design code that considers effects of this possible strength increase. Furthermore, the performance of a steel structure can be significantly affected by the strain rate sensitivity of the material properties. 

An accurate numerical simulation to study effects of strain rate on the seismic design requirements for steel structures requires an accurate material modelling. The primary focus of the proposed research is on the Characterization of Dynamic Material Properties for Structural Steel, and with the emphasis on the accurate modelling of its dynamic stress-strain behaviour. Coupon tests will be carried out to obtain a complete stress versus strain relationship up to fracture for a range of strain rates. Based on results from these tests, a strain rate dependent material model will be developed and guidelines provided on the selection of the dynamic mechanical properties to be used in the numerical seismic response simulation for a steel structure.

Using results from Characterization of Dynamic Material Properties for Structural Steel, a study will be conducted on Strain Rate Effects on Seismic Design Requirements for low-rise steel braced frames using strap tension only bracing. Parametric numerical simulations of the braced frames with different grade of steel, member size combination and ground motion will be carried out to assess the strain rate effects on the design requirements and provide guidelines to account for them in the design.","Structural engineering","Construction, urban and rural planning","Civil and Environmental Engineering","Khoo, Heng","RGPIN ","Steel structures","Structural engineering","G�nie des structures",2-5

"Mathematics often makes deep and surprising connections between seemingly unrelated subjects.  One of the most interesting problems in spectral analysis of the past few decades has been estimating the remainder term of the spectral counting function on compact Riemannian manifolds.  Even though this has occupied the attention of many mathematicians, very few generic results have been proven.  Interestingly, in some important cases these analysis problems have analogous counterparts in analytic number theory.  These include classic lattice counting problems (the error estimates in the Gauss circle problem and the Dirichlet divisor problem) and the error estimates for well known number theory functions (including the mean square average of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line).  In another direction these problems are related, via the trace formulae, to the geometric problem of counting closed geodesics (curves minimizing lengths locally) with total length less than a given number.  Much work remains to be done on these problems and one aspect of my proposed research aims at furthering the progress toward resolving the open conjectures, such as Hardy's conjecture for flat 2-tori, at this interesting interface between microlocal analysis, analytic number theory, and spectral geometry. Another class of closely related problems I propose to study is the distribution of lattice points within thin annuli.  The answer to these problems are different open conjectures depending on the width of the annulus and the inner radius.  In a special case, obtaining the sharp estimates of the number of the lattice points inside a thin irrational ellipsoid would prove some  open conjectures about Strichartz' inequalities for the non-linear Schr�dinger operator on irrational tori.

"The low-frequency variability in the tropical troposphere is dominated by an intra-seasonal oscillation of 40-50

days known as the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). Recent satellite observations revealed that tropical

convection is organized in a hierarchy of scales ranging from the individual clouds of one to 10 kilometers, to cloud clusters and super-clusters of hundreds and thousands of kilometers to planetary scale envelopes such as the MJO. The MJO has a profound impact on tropical and extra-tropical climate variability. It effects the precipitation rates during the Asian and Australian monsoons and its strength and occurrence are corollated with the El-Nino Southern oscillation as well as many other tropical-extratropical weather patterns such as the North Atlantic and North Pacific oscillations. Various floods, heavy rainfalls, and droughts in the North-Western United States and British Columbia and tropical storm activity were associated with different phases of the MJO. Despite the increasing progress in super-computing and considerable research efforts made during the recent few decades, current general circulation models fail to represent adequately the low frequency variability associated with organized tropical convection, and its fundamental physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This research project aims to use both idealized model parametrizations, specifically designed based on the inherent cloud morphology and convective cell circulation of organized convection, and detailed numerical simulation of cloud systems to study  these complex (convectively coupled) equatorial waves and the MJO and their interactions with climate and remote weather systems.

"My research program aims at explaining surprises in observational cosmology, guided by recent ideas in and principles of string theory. One key example is the observed cosmic acceleration. Although commonly ascribed to dark energy, a tantalizing alternative is a breakdown of Einstein's gravity on large scales. My research explores novel modifications to Einstein's theory of gravity, whether they predict late-time acceleration, and their implications for the cosmological constant problem.



Another major direction in my research program is to explain what happened in the early universe. Inflation is the leading candidate theory but the new tools of string theory open the door to a new realm of possibilities. A prime example is the ekpyrotic scenario, the cornerstone of my PhD thesis. Ekpyrosis proposes that the big bang is the result of a cataclysmic collision between two branes, one of which is our observable universe. The model is not without technical difficulties, and I am actively working on finding ways to overcome these obstacles. The holy grail here is nothing less than a genuine alternative to inflation.



One exciting possibility I am currently studying is gravity becoming exponentially weak at short distances. I intend to study the potentially dramatic implications for early-universe cosmology, in particular whether inflation can take place or whether this offers natural alternatives to the inflationary paradigm.","Physical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Physics and Astronomy","Khoury, Justin","SAPIN ","Relativity and gravitation","Theoretical physics and chemistry","Physique et chimie th�oriques",3-3

"Bacterial cell biology has seen a renaissance in the past several years that has been spurred in part by advances in imaging techniques. The ability of researchers to peer into cells and describe the localization and organization of macromolecular complexes involved in basic biological processes has advanced our understanding of how bacterial cells grow, move and divide. Major advances in fluorescence microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy (CEM) and cryo-electron tomography (CET) have provided new insight into the bacterial ultrastructures that accomplish these fundamental processes. It is now apparent that not unlike like their distant eukaryotic counterparts, bacteria are highly organized cells that possess internalized compartments, cytoskeletons, organized genomes and carefully positioned macromolecular machines. Furthermore, advances in imaging are providing evidence that these cellular systems and assemblies do not function independently, but generally in concert, to accomplish cellular goals. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the process of bacterial cell division, where the combination of cellular, molecular and imaging techniques are beginning to provided a wealth of knowledge about this most basic and fundamental bacterial process. This research project aims to use and develop cutting-edge cryo-electron microscopy techniques to determine the molecular architecture of protein complexes involved in bacterial cell division. Our long-term goal is to use our improved knowledge of the mechanism of cell division to identify new drug targets and exploit this fundamental process to fight the growing number of multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria.

"Concrete liquid containing structures (CLCS) are used as part of environmental engineering facilities such as water reservoirs and sewage treatment containments. While cylindrical shapes may be structurally suitable for tank construction, rectangular tanks are also often used for water treatment process related purposes. 

Currently, Canadian design standards do not directly address the structural design of these types of structures and this has led to inconsistency in design of such facilities. Also, many issues related to design of these structures have remained unresolved. There is a growing recognition of the importance of lifeline facilities and in particular CLCS and the need for substantial improvements in the design of such facilities. Careful design and detailing of these structures is necessary to meet the serviceability criteria for crack and leakage control. 

In recent years, the applicant has carried out extensive analytical investigations (static and dynamic time-history analysis) on the behavior of CLCS. The results have indicated that the current design approach do not represent the true behavior of these types of structures. Also, there is a great deal of inconsistency among the design standards for this important broad class of structures.  This is mainly due to the lack of understanding of the behavior of these structures under static and seismic loading.

The main objective of the proposed research study is to develop a rational design procedure, through analytical and experimental programs, for reinforced concrete tanks that assures a safe leak resistant structure. The concepts of water-tightness in liquid containing structures will be investigated. Several full-scale specimens representing segments from typical tank walls will be subjected to static as well as reversed cyclic loading simulating the seismic effects. These specimens while under such loads will be simultaneously subjected to liquid pressure and leakage tests. The analytical study will be based on non-linear finite element method. Both rectangular and circular tanks of various dimensions will be considered in this investigation. It is intended to provide the necessary input for code decision making.

"Connexins are proteins that assemble together to make tiny channels in the cell membrane. These channels allow cells to pass small molecules between one another, coordinating their functions. When connexin channels don't work properly, diseases can result- including male infertility. There are at least 20 different types of connexins and the channels they form have different properties. Different types of connexins are found in different cells, including within the male sex organs, suggesting that the different connexins perform unique functions in each different cell type. This research is aimed at finding out which parts of the connexin protein are most important for the specific functions it performs in the male sex organs. This information could be very important for designing treatments for diseases such as male infertility that are caused by connexin malfunction.

"Animals use many locomotor strategies for survival in various habitats.  Many factors (e.g., predator-prey interactions) are of profound ecological importance and depend heavily on a fish's ability to swim.  Over the past few decades, a significant amount of research has focused on determining the physiological mechanisms (e.g., patterns of energy fuel use, recovery processes) associated with exercise in fish, with some effort describing species differences in the response to exhaustive exercise.  More recently, researchers have shown that substantial intraspecific variability exists in the physiological response to exercise, and that this variability is almost as great as the variability noted between species.  However, the underlying cause of this within species variability in fish is not well known.  My research will focus on factors (e.g., temperature) that influence the post-exercise recovery process, and ultimately the underlying mechanisms that may account for the intraspecific variability in the exercise response in fish.  I will specifically examine the roles of post-exercise behaviour (i.e., behavioural thermoregulation- the ability to track temperatures to reduce metabolic costs) and ontogeny (i.e., development) on the post-exercise processes in fish.  Researchers have recently suggested that these factors may be important in describing the variability. I will also assess the swimming behaviour and physiology of a unique group of fish, the sturgeons.  My experimental approach involves the analysis of metabolites, assessment of behaviour and utilization of respirometric techniques.  My ultimate goal is to gain a better understanding of  the underlying processes/mechanisms that account for the enormous intraspecific variation in the physiological response to exercise in fish.  My proposed studies are unique in that they will examine the relationship between behaviour and post-exercise recovery processes.  In addition, these studies will focus on the development and plasticity of metabolism in fish.

"All electronic, magnetic and structural properties of a material are altered  near an interface between two materials due to the broken translational symmetry and  the  influence that one material can have another.  In some cases these changes are small  and confined to just a few atomic layers while in other situations   changes in behaviour are profound and  extend over many nanometers. Giant magnetoresistance in magnetic multilayers is one notable example because of the large impact this discovery has had on magnetic storage. Few experimental methods  are capable of probing local properties in a depth resolved manner.  We have developed one of these at TRIUMF called low energy beta-detected nuclear magnetic resonance. The only other similar method is low energy muon spin rotation/relaxation which can only be performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland.  The two methods have similar  principles but provide complementary information. Both may be regarded as a special form of  magnetic resonance, which are well  suited to studies in thin films and interfaces because they  require roughly 10 orders of magnitude fewer spins than conventional NMR. Our goal is to explore electronic properties  quantum materials and their interfaces using these novel methods.

"The sediments on the sea floor are natural archives of past climate and ocean variability. I propose to unravel the information preserved in these records by determining the contents of various organic remains and mineral and chemical properties, so- called proxies. The key to my novel contributions to paleo-oceanographic research is a multi-proxy approach, using a wide range of proxies, which enables my group to differentiate between local and global climate signals, and to establish phasing (i.e. causal) relationships between different components of the climate system.     

    Research in my group has two primary long-term goals: to understand more fully the importance of the tropical Pacific Ocean in past global climate change, and to establish a thorough understanding of nitrogen isotope evidence for past changes in the oceanic nitrogen inventory. The equatorial Pacific is fundamental to Earth's climate system, and has been purported to be instigator, amplifier and mediator of past global climate change on inter-annual to multi-millennial time-scales. For example, the El Ni�o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dominates the inter-annual variability of the tropical Pacific today, with tele-connections affecting climate worldwide, and it has thus been proposed that past global climate change could have been modulated by ""ENSO-like"" variations in the mean state of the tropical Pacific. My cross-disciplinary research into the systematics of nitrogen isotope evidence for past changes in the oceanic N cycling and inventory will shed light on the over-arching question whether or not biogeochemical changes, such as nitrate cycling are the primary cause for changes in the oceanic sequestration of atmospheric CO2 on multi-millennial time-scales.

    This kind of multi-proxy reconstruction of the full range of the spatial and temporal variability of the ocean and atmosphere and the interrelation between various components of Earth's climate system is required for validating current climate models and for establishing a 'background' state against which potential anthropogenic influences will have to be measured.

"Multiplayer games allow many human players to experience a game collectively, and have become an extremely popular genre. Ideally, these worlds are large, allowing a large number of people from across the world to interact. Network and computational resources, however, do not scale to larger (massive) sizes easily for distributed game environments, and current solutions involve various restrictions on virtual game world size, player interactivity, or ability to ensure each player simultaneously sees the same state. We base our proposal on an extension of current ""instanced"" game models, where players do not all play concurrently, rather a smaller group of at most around 100 players participate in a game, with each game instance quite separate from others. Instances can be accessed from a main game world or virtual ""lobby"" environment that allows network connected players to find other willing game participants. By extending the available interactions between disparate instances, and between instances and the game world or lobby we explore new game functionality as well as establish further techniques for extending game scalability, allowing more players to simultaneously play a game while ensuring an efficient underlying implementation. Our work will provide suitable new game consistency models, as well as experimental implementation in our Mammoth research game environment, and also a commercial game lobby environment.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Advancement of knowledge","Computer Science, School of","Kienzle, J�rg","STPGP ","Multimedia systems and networks","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",3-3
"The scope and complexity of computer-based and controlled systems continue to increase dramatically. Modern software must satisfy an increasing number of requirements, provide real-time functionality, and has to interact with other software systems in a heterogeneous and changing environment. More and more responsibility of providing critical functionality is assumed by software, and hence the consequences of such systems behaving in an unpredictable way can be considerable. To successfully build such dependable ""systems of systems"", applications have to be engineered in such a way that they can provide service in spite of faults. They must be able to tolerate unexpected behavior of external entities in their environment, unreliable underlying components, communication failures, erroneous data and faulty algorithms.



The goal of this continuing discovery grant project is to address this situation by integrating the concern of fault tolerance into the entire software development cycle following a model-driven approach. The overall benefits of a fault tolerance-aware process are considerable. Having fault tolerance in mind from the beginning allows software developers to ""engineer"" support for fault tolerance. It makes it possible to discover the need for fault tolerance early on, get valuable feedback from the client as early as possible, make informed decisions or tradeoffs and set priorities between reliability and safety, state the required levels of fault tolerance for different parts of the system precisely, and then choose the appropriate models, design and infrastructure to achieve it. A well-defined and guided process helps reducing the complexity of fault tolerance, results in more efficient use of the most appropriate fault tolerance models where they are needed, and hence the resulting software architecture, design and code are clear and readable, easy to maintain and deliver adequate performance.","Computer software","Information and communication services","Computer Science, School of","Kienzle, J�rg","RGPIN ","Software engineering","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",3-5

     Radiocarbon analyses are provided for Canadian and other researchers in the earth, life and environmental sciences. Their research focuses on many of the major issues facing Canadian society today: global climate change, greenhouse gases, groundwater and the Arctic environment. IsoTrace provides these users with highly accurate, reliable measurements from very small samples, prepared with a very low level of contamination.

     Other isotopes analysed include iodine-129 for use as an oceanographic and atmospheric tracer and as a monitor of the handling and storage of nuclear fuel material and beryllium-10 for geological surface exposure age dating and atmospheric monitoring. These analyses make use of the unique IsoTrace heavy element line, which is also used for research requiring extremely high levels of sensitivity.

    Research in AMS at IsoTrace includes studies of the physics and chemistry of negative ions, the separation of ions of different elements with similar masses using chemical reaction cells and the development of new techniques for ion production. From this research, new AMS equipment is developed which is used in use in many other laboratories around the world and for which several patents have been obtained. 

    Local graduate students participate in this research and gain hands-on experience in the design and commissioning of new techniques.

     Radiocarbon analyses are provided for Canadian and other researchers in the earth, life and environmental sciences. Their research focuses on many of the major issues facing Canadian society today: global climate change, greenhouse gases, groundwater and the Arctic environment. IsoTrace provides these users with highly accurate, reliable measurements from very small samples, prepared with a very low level of contamination.

     Other isotopes analysed include iodine-129 for use as an oceanographic and atmospheric tracer and as a monitor of the handling and storage of nuclear fuel material and beryllium-10 for geological surface exposure age dating and atmospheric monitoring. These analyses make use of the unique IsoTrace heavy element line, which is also used for research requiring extremely high levels of sensitivity.

    Research in AMS at IsoTrace includes studies of the physics and chemistry of negative ions, the separation of ions of different elements with similar masses using chemical reaction cells and the development of new techniques for ion production. From this research, new AMS equipment is developed which is used in use in many other laboratories around the world and for which several patents have been obtained. 

    Local graduate students participate in this research and gain hands-on experience in the design and commissioning of new techniques. IsoTrace also supports the work of many other graduate students across Canada through its analytical services and the advice on sample collection, selection and interpretation of results given by senior members of the IsoTrace team.

"The overall aim of this research program is to provide managers with efficient techniques to apply their expertise to organize and interpret large data sets. The program will address issues ranging from theory (representing preferences) through algorithms (organizing entities) to practice (understanding, manipulating, and utilizing data). It will extend to the design and development of decision support systems, which should result in improvements in environmental and infrastructure management and, more generally, in better informed and more responsive decisions.

     Multiple Criteria Classification and Analysis (MCCA) procedures are designed to help users classify entities described by multidimensional data. Classification organizes information, strengthens understanding, and facilitates the application of expert guidance, though it may or may not lead to an immediate decision. New MCCA tools will be developed, tested on real-world data, improved, and extended to handle uncertainties and missing data. 

     For instance, a sorting procedure based on MCCA was recently used to classify 1,285 Canadian municipalities as high-risk, low-risk, or robust with respect to future water supply, providing useful information to water-supply managers at all levels. A related technique can be used to design an A-B-C system to streamline inventory management in manufacturing, warehousing, and service organizations such as hospitals. 

     Data, which is now cheap to collect and easy to store and access, has mushroomed in the modern era. MCCA tools will lead to a democratization of expertise in understanding and acting upon this data, and will be of increasing importance in an age of scarcity and decentralization. .

"I am interested in developing theories and applications for enabling new and powerful ways to share knowledge using information systems. The basis of my research is that knowledge sharing requires commonality in content AND context. Commonality in content refers to shared understanding of meanings of vocabulary, rules, and conventions. Commonality in context refers to common characteristics and environment of the sharers. Those that share similar contexts are much more likely to have shared understanding and hence apt to use a knowledge sharing system more effectively than those whose contexts are different. The underlying thesis of my research is that a knowledge sharing system constructed by combining models of content (ontologies) and context (from social network analysis) is more effective than a system built on models of content or context alone. With Web-based computing evolving to a paradigm popularly termed Web 2.0, I plan to explore the research opportunity that lies in applying Web 2.0 concepts and tools to my research thesis. Specifically, I plan to use corporate Wikis, blogs, social bookmarks, and social networking as sources to explicate and refine the content of ontologies, and analyze link structures to model the context of ontologies. Semantic Web technologies will be used to implement these ontologies.

"One of the most important mathematical ideas of the second half of the 19th century is that an analytic formula often encodes discrete information. For example, one might want to count the number of solutions of a particular equation, but discover that the solutions are very hard to find. On the other hand, one might want to count the number of solutions to a sequence of equations and have the answers as a sequence. Mathematicians call these kinds of problems 'discrete'. The functions that appear in calculus, and for which calculus works so well, are not 'discrete', but 'analytic.' Amazingly, the right kinds of analytic functions often provide the answers to the discrete problems. An L-function is a type of a generating function formed out of local data associated with either an arithmetic-geometric object (such as Galois groups and elliptic curves) or a modular form. These L-functions provide the right kinds of analytic functions. For example, zeros of the Riemann zeta functions provide the answer to the problem of counting prime numbers. Another conjectural example is that the zero of the L-functions of an elliptic curve provide the answer to whether the elliptic curve has an infinitely many rational solutions.



In the past thirty years, these examples have been systematized into a branch of number theory called the Langlands program. The Langlands program is an ambitious plan to unify number theory, harmonic analysis and geometry. It opened a new frontier in mathematics, and has given new insights and techniques in solving old problems. In fact, the solution of Fermat's last theorem by Andrew Wiles is one of the achievements of the Langlands program. My research will have far-reaching consequences in number theory, representation theory.

"One of the regulatory requirements - and internal risk management practices - of insurers is to set up a certain

amount of capital that can protect the company against insolvency due to unexpected loss. The method

of the capital determination and understanding its characteristics are thus of great importance to all the

stakeholders in the market, including investors, regulators, and rating agencies. Traditional methods of doing

this often involved prescribed formulas by regulators, but now we are witnessing a rapid and consistent shift

towards a stochastic modelling framework in risk management around the world due to the realization of the

complexity of modeling risks and globalization of financial regulations.

The objective of my proposed research is to develop practical yet theoretically sound tools that can be used for

 capital determination and allocation of multi-line insurers. In particular, I will tackle several mathematical

problems that are related to one another using developments in Statistics, e.g., Extreme Value

Theory, copulas, and the bootstrap. This research topic is timely and practically important in the insurance

industry, and can also, in principle, be applied to other financial and non-financial entities, such as banks and

manufacturers.

The proposed research program also offers excellent training, both theoretical and practical, opportunities for the students who are keen to apply statistical theory in solving real world problems in finance and actuarial science.

"Over the past decade, there has been an explosive growth in demand for wireless data services. In particular, the evolution from wireless voice to wireless internet data and wireless video is causing exponentially increasing demand for wireless capacity. However, it is generally very hard to increase the wireless transmission rates, because the wireless channel suffers from many artifacts including fading, which significantly degrades the quality of the signal. One of the key methods to mitigate such challenges is to implement multiple antennas at the transmitter and/or at the receiver. In many applications, however, such as in cellular, ad hoc, and sensor networks, it is not always practical to implement multiple antennas due to the size, power, and cost limitations of the terminals. Addressing this problem, a new class of technology, called cooperative diversity, was proposed and it has recently drawn a great deal of interest. The basic idea of cooperative diversity is that several single-antenna terminals ""cooperate"" in order to mitigate the fading. That is, the multiple terminals help one another in order to send their own and other's signals more reliably over wireless fading channels. The basic properties and performance of cooperative networks have recently been studied in many publications. However, there still remain a number of important issues to be solved. In the proposed research, these problems will be solved to enhance the wireless communication systems based on cooperative diversity. For example, we will study the issues on optimum system resource allocation and efficient methods to combine transmitted signal packets in cooperative diversity networks. The final objective of the proposed research is to optimize cooperative diversity systems. The outcomes of this research will enable wireless communications companies to reduce the expenses and help them maximize profits. Since there are many wireless communications companies in Canada, this research will have a direct economic benefit for Canada. Furthermore, this research will significantly contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students by providing them with the fundamental and the state-of-the-art theories on communications.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Kim, IlMin","RGPIN ","Wireless communication systems","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",1-5

"The proposed research aims to separate and model the core components in the geomagnetic field from the magnetometer measurements that have been used in attitude control of satellites, in order to fill temporal coverage gaps that exist between conventional satellite magnetic missions and to improve our understanding of the Earth's magnetic properties and its origin. The satellite magnetic data will provide key insights on the geomagnetic field model (GFM), which is based largely on ground observatory data that has poor and biased coverage. The GFM also relies on the conventional satellite magnetic data, but significant temporal gaps exist between missions. Fortunately, low-Earth orbit satellites carry on-board attitude control magnetometers (TAMs). It was recently determined that only 3 days of TAM measurements from the KOMPSAT-1 satellite were found to provide important knowledge on the behaviour of the magnetic field for the roughly 30 years since 1958, when conventional magnetic missions were unavailable. Accordingly, a study is proposed to investigate the use of comprehensive TAM data from the entire measurement data of KOMPSAT-1 and -2 satellites and conventional magnetic data from other magnetic survey satellites. Procedures and state-of-the-art data processing techniques will include coordinate transformation, spectral correlation filtering, quadrant-swapping, spherical harmonic coefficient calculation, and subsurface modeling. As research outcomes, the total field map and the spherical harmonic core field model can be used to update global models. The results of the subsurface modeling will also improve our understanding of crustal distribution of hydrocarbons and mineral resources, as well as geological hazards.","Earth sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Geomatics Engineering","Kim, JeongWoo","RGPIN ","Survey engineering and remote sensing","Civil engineering","G�nie civil",2-5

"Probiotics are 'living micro-organisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host'.  An increasing number of studies provide scientific evidence for the efficacy and efficiency of probiotics in alleviating several inflammatory diseases. However, the specific mechanisms by which probiotic bacteria contribute to health, and, especially, their anti-inflammatory properties remain poorly understood. This research program is to investigate the signaling and molecular immunomodulatory mechanisms of probiotics. We have shown that probiotic strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus are potent inducers of G-CSF production, which suppresses production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in activated macrophages. We hypothesize that L. rhamnosus preferentially induces G-CSF in monocytes/macrophages, which is a key anti-inflammatory cytokine mediating immunomodulatory effects on macrophages and dendritic cells. To address the hypothesis, we propose the following four specific research objectives: 1) Investigating the signaling mechanism of G-CSF production in L. rhamnosus-activated macrophages, 2) Investigating the effect of G-CSF on macrophages, 3) Investigating the mechanism of G-CSF in regulating macrophage activation and 4) Investigating the role of G-CSF on dendritic cells.

This research program will provide information about the ill-defined mechanisms of the immunomodulatory effects elicited by probiotics. The immunomodulatory role of G-CSF in dendritic cells and T cells is an emerging concept and its detailed mechanism remains to be delineated. This research program will also reveal the signaling mechanism by which G-CSF induces immunomodulation in both macrophages and dendritic cells. Within five years, we will have not only significantly advanced an important immunological field, but also revealed key mechanisms involved in probiotic function. Our research will also help designing new probiotic products to better induce anti-inflammatory effects, which ultimately may benefit the growing number of people with inflammatory diseases.

"The research program proposed here concerns theoretical studies of electronic properties of complex materials such as transition metal oxides, materials with heavy atomic elements (f-electron-based), high temperature cuprate superconductors, and organic materials. Complex materials with many atomic elements often show unexpected behaviors in electronic properties. Controlling such unusual behaviors is the key for the design of new materials with advanced properties. On the other hand, it has been known that these behaviors are not just random events and certain universality among different materials emerges. The primary objective of my research is to understand the emergent universality that will be extremely important for subsequent development of science and technology of these materials. I am mainly interested in novel magnetic and transport properties of insulating and metallic magnetic systems and phase transitions between different phases of matter in those systems.

"The proposed research has the following fundamental themes: (1) In classes of geometric/analytical objects,

what can we say about the objects that have the best possible values of given quantities? (2) How are the

analytical properties of an object related to its geometric nature?



Regarding (1), one of the basic subjects is the optimal solutions to allocation of resources while there are transportation costs for moving mass from one location to another; for example, consider matching water resources to residential areas. This optimal transportation problem and its generalizations/modifications have

found a lot of interesting connections in mathematical analysis and geometry, and it has long been considered

and applied in mathematical economics, probability theory, fluid/continuum mechanics, and more recently in

meteorology and biology. A qualitative study of the optimal solutions will be addressed, focusing on regularity

(smoothness) of the optimal solutions and the nature of singularities.  It will emphasize the case the transport

occurs on global domains such as manifolds. Also to be explored is the situation when the resources and the costs change in time. Among possible approaches is to investigate the hidden geometric structures of the cost functions which govern the transportation. 



For (2), a more specific question to be addressed is how much one can determine the shape of an object from

the information on the frequencies of its vibration; for example, as Marc Kac phrased, ``Can one hear the shape

of a drum?'' Despite its long history and significance in geometric analysis and physics, this so-called inverse

spectral problem is still far from being fully answered, even for two-dimensional surfaces. A focus will be on

the case when surfaces have boundary. A first step, but still a difficult problem, is to check whether

there is no degeneration in the set of the surfaces having the same vibration frequencies.

"Technological advances made in the past century owe a great deal to our understanding of the basic physics of novel materials and our ability to adapt the composition and structure of materials for functional applications. On the other hand, these efforts to develop new materials have led to the creation of a remarkable atomic scale laboratory of quantum physics. Quantum materials, such as high temperature superconductors, exhibit extremely complex quantum phases, and transitions between them are driven by only small changes in composition, or through the application of external perturbations such as magnetic field or pressure. It is this great sensitivity to external perturbations that makes such complex quantum materials ideal for functional applications in electronics, communications, and energy, and detailed understanding of their physical properties is necessary for such applications. Of particular interest is the investigation of novel quantum phases, and transition and/or competition between these phases. For example, quantum spin liquid phase, in which conventional magnetic order is destroyed due to strong quantum fluctuations, is drawing much attention thanks to its exotic ground state properties and possible implications for superconductivity. Recently some organic quantum magnets that exhibit certain traits of the spin liquid phase have been discovered, and we will investigate such materials.

Using state-of-the-art instruments available at the new generation of synchrotron x-ray sources and neutron facilities, such as the Canadian Light Source and the new Spallation Neutron Source, we will carry out inelastic and elastic, x-ray and neutron scattering experiments. This will tell us how the electrons in these materials interact with other electrons and the lattice, and also how these electrons arrange themselves in such complex materials. Such information can shed light on microscopic understanding of advanced functional materials of the future.

"Whether a person develops a disease from air pollution exposure depends on the inherent toxicity of the pollutant; amount, frequency, and length of exposure; exposure to other pollutants; and personal characteristics and behaviors.  These factors can all be important; but they are poorly understood, difficult to quantify, and not routinely reported in environmental health studies.  Lack of attention paid to exposure assessment makes this issue a weak link in environmental health studies; yet exposure assessment offers one of the greatest opportunities for improving our understanding of the environmental pollutant source-health effects link.  This proposal involves research into improved methods for understanding factors contributing to air pollution exposure.

   In our previous work we validated a computer model that simulates movement of fine particles through cracks to understand factors affecting infiltration of these particles into residences. We also examined use of a low volume air sampler and individual particle analysis for collecting particulate source information at locations more representative of human exposure. We showed that condensed oil droplets from vehicle exhaust dominated particle counts in samples collected close to roadways and plant fragments dominated particle counts in samples collected close to greenbelt areas in a city. Finally, we demonstrated a sensitive method for detecting small changes to air quality for understanding air quality trends.

   Proposed research extends this work by further investigating the low volume air sampling and individual particle analysis method to confirm it can measure trace elements that are key markers of anthorpogenic emissions.  Further examination of the method for trend analysis will be made from a point-of-view of routine application for air quality management purposes.  Research will also involve measuring air pollutants in indoor, outdoor, and/or personal exposure settings and characterizing factors that contribute to exposures in an effort to clarify the role of indoor versus outdoor pollutants.

"The radial head is one of three bones which form the elbow joint. The radial head allows for both bending and straightening of the elbow and rotation of the forearm. Fractures of the radial head are the most common elbow fractures seen in adults and frequently result in stiffness, pain and weakness. While most radial head fractures can be fixed, some are too fragmented to allow successful healing. Radial head replacement is employed in such cases, however, relative to the success of hip and knee replacements, the outcome of radial head implants has been less reliable. Current implants do not mimic the complex shape of the proximal radius; hence it is not surprising that there is a high incidence of failure of these devices. The objective of the current study is to accurately measure the shape of the proximal radius of a large number of normal elbows using computer imaging in an effort to develop an anatomic radial head implant system. We also plan to compare the performance of these anatomic implants with the native radial head in a bench-top cadaveric study. Furthermore we plan to use computer imaging to develop an exact replica of the native radial head using a reverse-engineering approach, to evaluate the feasibility and performance of custom manufactured radial head prostheses that precisely match that of patients. We are optimistic that this 'bench to bedside' approach will result in improved outcome for patients afflicted this common fracture.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services",Surgery,"King, Graham","RGPIN ","Biomedical engineering","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",2-5

"The cattle industry has successfully been using genetic markers to select bulls for qualitative traits, especially to reduce recessive genetic disorders, but the current available markers have limited application for quantitative traits, such as fertility. Fertility has become the major breeding and management issue facing dairy farmers today, therefore efforts are made to shift from genetic markers for the selection of qualitative traits to investigate markers at the morphological, cellular and molecular levels to select bulls with higher fertility capability. In fact, fertility rates of bulls selected for their qualitative traits and maintained for insemination purposes are highly variable. Therefore the purpose of this proposal is to identify genetic markers of fertility to achieve a pre-screening of bulls before undergoing AI to increase overall fertility. We are specifically aiming to investigate both the testis-specific protein y encoded (TSPY) and the Na/K ATPase as fertility markers both in blood and/or sperm, being the two easier and most cost-effective ways to screen the bull population. This proposal is aimed to improve the cattle AI production for the Canadian industry, selecting bulls for fertility merits rather than qualitative traits based on molecular markers as well as giving a better insight into the role of specific molecular markers in the male fertility field.

"The transition from water to air breathing is arguably one of the most dramatic changes to occur in animal physiology. While it first took place during vertebrate evolution millions of years ago, the progressive emergence of lung ventilation still takes place routinely during the development of many vertebrate species. Such transition requires important changes within the neural circuits that drive and regulate breathing, yet to this day, the mechanisms that make this fascinating transition possible remain poorly understood. To attend this issue, the long term objective of my research program is to understand the neurophysiological changes within the respiratory control system associated with the emergence of air breathing in vertebrates. Over the next five year, we will use the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) to investigate the impact of challenging environments (e.g. poor oxygen) on the maturation of these neural circuits. We will focus on the role of corticosterone, a steroid hormone, in this process.

"The Earth's crust is composed almost entirely of silicates, compounds of silicon (Si) and oxygen, and interacts with water on a massive scale to yield a hydrosphere replete with dissolved Si. It is biology, however, that controls the global Si cycle.  Single-celled algae take up the majority of dissolved Si to construct their ornate cell walls composed of silica. Terrestrial plants require a constant supply to defend against biological and physical stresses, and, in mammals, Si is essential for stimulating connective tissue growth. Virtually nothing is known, however, about the chemical mechanisms underlying silicon biofunctionality. 



Commercially, aqueous silicates rank among the world's major chemical commodities. They are fundamental to uses as diverse as coatings, detergents, paper manufacturing and water treatment. However, many emerging applications, such as the directed fabrication of advanced engineering materials, have been hindered by our limited understanding of aqueous Si chemistry. 



My research program addresses all these issues. We are successfully characterizing the large array of molecular structures that exist in silicate solutions, unravelling the chemical role of silicon in biology, and learning how to make silicon chemistry work better in applications such as cement and the creation of novel microporous materials.

"There has been extremely rapid growth of wireless technology in recent years, along with increasing availability of high bandwidth network infrastructures (especially the SuperNet in Alberta). Advances in mobile technologies and the popularity of handheld devices have opened up new accessibility opportunities for citizens. The true potential of e-learning as ""anytime, anywhere"" has finally begun to be realized, particularly for those in remote communities.

     The primary goal of this research program is to advance research on the innovative paradigms, architectures and implementations of wireless applications and systems for individualised and adaptive learning. With the use of personalized learning on mobile devices, the long terms goal is to facilitate education, at least as high a quality as available in a classroom environment, and even surpass that by incorporating situation-specific content and problem scenarios from learners' surrounding environments.

     Within this long-term research program, current proposal aims to extend our understanding of mobile learning to provide rich learning experiences in higher education by exploiting the benefits of location, device and student modelling, and combining them with mobile technology to achieve personalized and situation-specific learning through the analysis of students' surroundings, situation-specific problem-solving by students through multiple forms of input (such as text typed by keypad or in digital ink, images taken by mobile devices' camera, audio recorded on mobile device and so on), for rich learning experiences.

"Cells respond to hostile conditions in their environment by switching on genes that code for proteins that ultimately provide protection against cellular injury.  The function of genes that are turned on in this so-called ""stress response"" are becoming increasingly well characterized and are involved in chaperoning proteins that become unfolded, replacement of damaged cellular membranes and degradation of damaged protein.  In addition, our understanding of the complex pathways that switch these stress genes on and off during cell injury is becoming clearer.  Nonetheless, we continue to identify new stress genes and signaling pathways revealing how a cell senses its physiological state and adapts to provide defense against unfavorable conditions.



We describe studies examining the function and control of cytochrome P450 2A5 (in mice) and CYP2A6 (in humans), drug metabolizing enzymes that has not previously been categorized as a stress-responsive genes.  We wish to determine why levels of this enzyme increase during liver injury, due to a wide range of chemical and biological stimuli, and find out the roles CYP2A5/6 play in tolerating and protecting against such insults.  Specifically, we propose experiments to examine the involvement of these enzymes in heme degradation and protection against stress in the endoplasmic reticulum.  These studies will increase our understanding of how cells adapt to stress and remain healthy.

"The quantum dynamics of atoms and molecules can be formulated in terms of fundamental equations. Except for the simplest cases, these equations cannot be solved in pen and paper form. Instead, high-performance computers or clusters of those are needed to carry out the calculations. 



A moderate-size computing cluster is requested in this proposal. It consists of compute nodes that provide the CPU power for the calculations, a master node to administer them, and the necessary switch to connect the machines and to allow for fast communication between them. The equipment will enable us to address ion-atom and ion-molecule collisions involving few or many active electrons, which make the computations rather demanding. It also allows us to look at collisions which are embedded in a laser pulse to be used to steer the dynamics of the system. Calculations will be carried out to obtain results with predictive power. They will shed light on fundamental physics issues, and will also be beneficial for applications in medical physics and related fields. Especially, we will calculate ionization and fragmentation of water molecules, which is relevant for understanding the radiation damage of biological tissue. In the long term our studies will benefit the complex field of damage to larger molecules such as DNA.

"The structure of atoms and small molecules is known to great accuracy. However, when it comes to the question of how they behave in collsions and/or the presence of strong laser fields the situation is much less clear. This is so because of their quantum physical nature and because of the complexity of the many-body problem of physics: it can be formulated, but it cannot be solved in closed form.



The proposed research program aims at providing some answers to this problem by theoretical analysis and numerical calculations. We will look at ion-atom and ion-molecule collisions, and at collisions which are embedded in a laser pulse to be used to steer the quantum dynamics of the system. The latter will be of interest for applications in the long run. Ion-molecule collisions, especially those involving water molecules, are attracting such immediate interest: They are important for understanding the radiation damage of biological tissue.



We are pursuing our studies because we are fundamentally interested in the physics, and also because there are significant applications in medical physics and related fields. In the long term our studies will not only benefit the field of tumor radiation therapy, but also the more complex field of damage to larger molecules such as DNA.

"This project aims at conducting a preliminary proof-of-concept study of a requirements-driven data warehouse construction. It proposes a first step towards a new long term vision: a top-down data warehousing design-time as well as run-time process, where (mostly non technical) users need only to focus on the careful and declarative specification of application requirements at design time, and a tool will (semi)automatically generate and populate an underlying data warehouse at run time.  Two specific tasks are to be solved: first, design a conceptual integration modeling language for representing typical integration features such as data provenance, data access requirements for materialization, and mappings from the conceptual model to the underlying multidimensional model (which can be expressed as a data cube); second, build a prototype tool that uses models expressed in the conceptual integration modeling language to drive the design and the population of a data warehouse.  Expected results of this research will be a contribution to the Canadian Business Intelligence industry. Data warehousing is one of the cornerstones of the industry, so research advancing data warehousing will be crucial to the flagship Canadian software companies that currently lead the industry.

"Many of the data sources upon which today's education, science, business, and government depend have been generating increasingly heterogeneous, networked, and vast amounts of data stored in a variety of formats. Our past work has contributed to building networks of relational databases (called peer databases, or simply peers) that make such a gigantic amount of data available for sharing. Peer databases share data using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. A P2P network is point-to-point  communication infrastructure which is used by peers to establish acquaintances prior to sharing data. Ensuring data sharing across heterogeneous boundaries in a semantically meaningful way has been at the core of our research.  In collaroration with others, we have produced a prototype peer database management system (PDBMS) that uses the so-called mapping tables to solve the heterogeneity problem. Mapping tables are correspondences between data values as well as between schema elements at different peers. Using mapping tables, a PDBMS typically establishes acquaintances with remote peers, answers queries using data originating in acquainted peers, and propagate local updates to remote peers. Our research program has two main objectives which are to design advanced transaction models for the PDBMS setting, and to implement these transaction models on top our existing PDBMS infrastructure. Since PDBMSs are similar to traditional multidatabase systems in which the local data sources are not integrated, but rather coordinated, we closely examine the transaction models proposed for traditional multidatabase systems and relax many of their assumptions, as well as we add new ones that are more suitable for the PDBMS setting. The main issues we deal with are the relationship among local peer transactions, the consistency of the latter, concurrency control and recovery across a large amount of peers.  We aim at making the vision of  end-user oriented Internet data sharing possible. Users will only need to focus on their local data while the intricacies of the interoperability with remote peers will be handled as automatically as possible at the system level.

"During the last decade a real-time processing of data-streams has become the one of the major applications of high-performance computers (e.g. digital audio and video broadcasting, multimedia, machine vision, wireless communication and many other).  Existing approaches are based on processors with fixed architecture: Application Specific Processors (ASP) or Application Specific Integrated circuits (ASIC). Platforms based on programmable processors are limited by performance due to sequential nature of computation. Platforms based on ASICs can provide the highest processing speed but due to the lack of flexibility no modification or fault recovery is possible. On the other hand, a recent progress in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology has allowed a development of Dynamically Reconfigurable Stream Processors (DRSP), which may provide flexibility similar to programmable processors and processing speed close to ASIC based systems. However, the major problem with DRSP is keeping a high cost-efficiency by run-time optimization of its architecture to variation of the algorithms and data-stream structure of a workload. Another problem of DRSP based on SRAM FPGA devices is necessity of run-time self-recovery from hardware faults in the data-paths. Thus, the major problem in implementation of the concept of DRSP is lack of run-time architecture optimization mechanisms built-in to the system. These mechanisms should be able to reconfigure the stream-processing data-paths according to the algorithm / stream variations to keep the performance and cost-performance parameters on required level. Therefore, the proposed research seeks to achieve the following objectives: i) develop the high-level synthesis methodology for optimization of deep pipelined data-paths on the base of partially reconfigurable FPGAs; ii) develop algorithms and procedures for run-time selection of the close-to-optimal variant of architecture in multi-parametric design space; iii) investigate the cost-effectiveness of the developed methodology on experimental FPGA-based platform and iv) develop the self-restoration mechanisms for run-time mitigation of the transient (e.g. SEU) and permanent hardware faults.

"There is a very high demand for semiconductor lasers that can be integrated directly with silicon integrated circuits. These devices will be required to have very low power dissipation, should be low cost, reliable and be tolerant of large variations in operating temperature. The application of these devices will be in future telecommunications and computing systems, including server farms, network hubs and eventually in personal computers and personal multimedia entertainment systems. The integrated semiconductor lasers will allow direct connection to high bandwidth optical fibre data links. To date none of the candidate technologies that has been investigated has proved to be ideal. In this project we propose to investigate the integration of our recently demonstrated freestanding InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) microtube coherent light sources directly on silicon, in order to develop electrically modulated lasers. These devices have many attractive properties, including ultralow threshold currents, and simple fabrication. This technology also has the potential to deliver tunable lasers for applications in either dense or coarse wavelength division multiplexing systems. This project represents a collaboration between three academic researchers with complementary skill sets and backgrounds, and a Canadian start-up company, Reflex Photonics, which is leading the development of low cost, parallel optical data link technology. The project will also involve the collaboration of a leading international expert in silicon photonics (M.Lipson of Cornell University).

"Surface plasmon resonance sensing allows the detection of very low concentrations of a wide range of different molecular species of interest. It has important application in many fields. One example is medical diagnostics where it can be used to sense the presence of proteins that indicate that the patient has a medical condition well in advance of other symptoms being visible and thus enabling early treatment. In drug screening it can be used to rapidly identify candidate compounds (and so is of great value to the Canadian pharmaceutical industry) and in environmental sensing it may be used to detect pathogens in the public water supply. Here we propose a research program which will improve the sensitivity, specificity and practicality of surface plasmon resonance sensing. To do this we will make use of periodic optical nanostructures in order to increase the intensity of the electromagnetic fields at the surface of the sensor and hence increase sensitivity. We will combine recent advances in the analysis of isolated nanostructures with our own research into periodic nanostructures in order to obtain the maximum benefits of both. We will also incorporate quantum dots in order to increase specificity (i.e. fewer false-positive detections) and will investigate techniques to make the sensing systems better integrated and lower cost. This program will provide training for 4 PhD students and 3 Masters students in a multidisciplinary environment in which they will gain expertise in electromagnetic modeling, micro- and nanofabrication, instrumentation, biochemistry and biomedical engineering.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Kirk, Andrew","RGPIN ","Photon devices","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",3-5

"Niacin (vitamin B3) is required to make nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD is then used in all of our energy producing and molecule building reactions as a way of moving electrons. Thus, it is not surprising that niacin deficiency causes health problems. In humans, niacin deficiency causes the disease pellagra, which has the unique symptoms of sun-sensitive dermatitis and schizophrenia-like dementia. Of interest, deficiencies of other nutrients that participate in electron moving reactions (riboflavin, iron) do not lead to dermatitis or dementia. This puzzle has been partially solved by the discovery of ADP-ribosylation reactions, which use NAD in a very different way. The sun-sensitivity suggests a role for niacin in DNA repair processes, and much of the work in my lab has focused on NAD as a substrate for poly(ADP-ribose) formation, which happens in response to DNA damage and is required for effective DNA repair. We have found that niacin deficient rats have low levels of NAD and poly ADP-ribose in bone marrow cells, and a sensitivity to developing leukemias. We propose that megadoses of niacin will enhance apoptosis in cancer cells, while at the same time improving genomic stability in normal bone marrow cells. The dementia of niacin deficiency resolves rapidly with niacin treatment, suggesting that NAD participates in neuronal signaling pathways. A likely mechanism involves the formation of cyclic ADP-ribose, which controls calcium levels in neurons. We have found that niacin deficient rats have decreases in brain NAD and cyclic ADP-ribose, and they have altered spatial learning and changes in various behavioral tests. Most forms of learning are linked to changes in synaptic signaling that increase synapse strength (long term potentiation, LTP) or activly decrease synaptic strength (long term depression, LTD). In future work, we will examine LTP and LTD in hippocampal slices, use startle reflex to examine behaviours more associated with human dementia, and examine brain sections for structural and connectivity changes. I will continue to work on these and related projects to promote a better understanding of how niacin functions in metabolism and the role of altered ADP-ribosylation reactions in the pathologies of deficiency.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Health, education and social services","Human Health and Nutritional Sciences","Kirkland, James","RGPIN ",Nutrition,"Life sciences research related to human health and disease","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines",2-5

The objective of the proposed research is to further our understanding of the inherent computational complexity of a number of fundamental combinatorial and geometric problems. Our main goal is to provide answers to two complementary questions: (i) ""In what ways and to what extent do certain structural features (attributes of specific problem instances) contribute to the difficulty of solving problems in a particular family?"" and (ii) ""In what ways and to what extent can certain naturally occurring features or constraints be exploited to provide more efficient solutions for problem instances that exhibit these features?""



The problems that we propose to address (like those addressed in my previous research) are distinguished by the fundamental role that they play in a variety of applications, including robotic motion planning and optimization, facility and sensor location, efficient schemes for broadcasting streamed information and optimization of log milling.  This, of course, provides significant practical motivation for progress on the second of the questions above. However, the problems are also chosen for their ability to serve as representatives of broader families of similarly structured problems. For this reason they motivate, from a more theoretical standpoint, progress on the first question.  Ultimately, our success should be measured in terms of (i) the development of new general techniques for the design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures, and (ii) the elucidation of inherent complexity limitations that apply in the broadest possible computational context.

"Microbes are the essential drivers of  biogeochemical cycling and carbon (energy)-flow in aquatic ecosystems.  Within the context of ecosystem function, free-floating photosynthetic algae (phytoplankton) and heterotrophic bacteria (bacterioplankton) have distinct roles as primary producers and decomposers, respectively.  Though often studied as autonomous functional-groups in aquatic ecosystems, algal and bacterial communities can interact in a variety of ways that are antagonistic and/or synergistic.  To improve our understanding of energy flow and nutrient cycles across freshwater ecosystems, my research program will focus on the important roles of algae and bacteria as key players in aquatic ecosystem function and contaminant fate.  Specifically, my research group will determine how the synergistic and antagonistic interactions between algae and bacteria mediate carbon, nutrient, and contaminant dynamics in lake systems.  A series of small lakes from the ""Land Between"" ecotone in south-central Ontario will be the focus of our research program.  The Land Between is a narrow ecological transition zone between limestone and granite-dominated bedrock along a transect from Parry Sound to Kingston in the Great Lakes Basin.  The geological mosaic of the Land Between offers an ideal array of environmental gradients (i.e. pH, dissolved organic carbon, and nutrients) due to the variable physiography.  As such, we will be able to directly assess the algal-bacterial communities in lakes representing a range of environmental characteristics, all within a relatively small geographic and climatic region.  This research program will be the first of its kind to (1) Characterize the community structure/function of metabolically-distinct microbial groups in lakes, and (2) Show how algal-bacterial interactions influence carbon, nutrient, and contaminant dynamics in freshwater systems.

"Foreland basins, that are eventually deformed and incorporated within fold-thrust belts in collisional orogens, are hosts to outstanding reserves in hydrocarbon resources around the world. Hydrocarbon bearing fluids trapped within foreland basin sediments will migrate from source rocks to reservoirs at any given time and anywhere within the deforming orogen. Fundamental studies in structural geology are essential to understanding syntectonic fluid flow in foreland basins and fold and thrust belts. Understanding the origin, development and geometry of fracture and fault patterns in various geological structures and how these patterns affect flow is extremely useful in providing appropriate foundations for fluid flow studies and solving fracture flow problems. The long term objective of my research program is to improve our understanding of fluid flow in fold and thrust belts by investigating the genetic relationship between development of structural features and fractures and their spatio-temporal interaction with fluid migration. 



Traditionally, the role of structural geology in the location and definition of hydrocarbon reservoirs has been to define the geometry and spatial organization of structures such as folds and fractures. Field observations, theoretical analyses and analogue modeling of these structures have led to a sound understanding of their 3D geometry and spatial relationship. Although an understanding of the geometry and spatial relationship of folds and faults is extremely useful it does not provide any insight into the possible fluid migration paths that may have operated during the development of such structures. The development of dynamic models that link geometrical complexity and spatio-temporal evolution of geological structures while considering the interaction of fluids throughout deformation is important for a better comprehension of the dynamic system as a whole and constitutes a major research avenue that will constitute to be the focus of my research activities during the next granting cycle. Understanding these interactions is even more important now that exploration for hydrocarbon in fold and thrust belts has moved to locating smaller, more complex and subtle fractured reservoirs, difficult to image seismically.

"The primary objective of this NSERC-funded research program is the development of microbial fuel cell technology using glycerol from biodiesel production as the fuel source.  Glycerol is a high-volume co-product of biodiesel production; however, the supply of glycerol for existing markets is well-established, so increases in biodiesel production are leading to the devaluation of glycerol as a commodity.  The Canadian government is investing in expanded production and use of biodiesel and other renewable fuels through its Renewable Fuels Strategy, most notable the ""ecoENERGY for Biofuels Initiative"" announced in 2007 which will contribute up to $1.5 billion for expansion of renewable fuel production in Canada.  Expanded production of biodiesel, and consequently of glycerol, will mean that new glycerol conversion technologies could have a significant economic impact.

     Glycerol oxidation has been identified as having strong potential for development of new applications and markets.  Glycerol is readily used as a carbon source by microbial cultures, and could therefore be used as a fuel source for microbial fuel cells.  Past research has focused almost entirely on the use of glucose and of ill-defined wastewater streams in microbial fuel cells.

     This program will define the potential of glycerol, a readily-available, inexpensive, and renewable feedstock, as a novel fuel for microbial fuel cell systems.  This research will lead to improved fundamental understanding of the microbial conversion of glycerol, while exploring the applied potential of glycerol bioconversion for use as a new biofuel and as a chemical feedstock.  The use of glycerol as a biofuel for microbial fuel cells will be an outstanding complement to the source of glycerol, biodiesel production, by enhancing the overall energy yield from the original lipid feedstocks.

"The brain contains specialized regions that mediate the rewards and pleasures of everyday life.  Unfortunately, the same regions of the brain may also be activated by addictive drugs like cocaine, morphine and alcohol, and may lead to uncontrollable use of these substances.  In fact, the Canadian Community Health Survey (2002) estimated that 600,000 Canadians were dependent of alcohol and 200,000 on illicit drugs.  Despite significant advances in the treatment of addiction, nearly half of addicts eventually relapse to an uncontrolled use of the addictive substance.  Stress and exposure to the environmental situations associated with previous drug taking have been identified as contributors to relapse to substance use.   The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus is a midline thalamic nucleus which provides a major source of inputs to parts of the brain associated with reward and motivation.  Research evidence indicates that the paraventricular nucleus relays arousal information and may be strongly activated during stressful conditions and by environmental cues associated with addictive drugs.  Furthermore, the paraventricular nucleus contains a high concentration of a new group of peptides called orexins which have been linked to drug addiction.  Therefore, we propose to determine if orexins activate neurons in the paraventricular nucleus during conditions associated with stress and drug addiction.  This research will provide important information about the brain mechanisms associated with reward and motivation.  In addition, we hope that the proposed research will provide preclinical data that may be useful for designing new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of addiction.

"Due to the ever-evolving nature of safety and security related threats like terrorism, accidents and disasters, the protection of critical sites or assets like airports, government buildings, bridges, nuclear sites and hospitals has become a paramount concern for governments and companies alike. Using multiple short-range radar systems that are distributed around the site of interest, we can monitor the targets (e.g., vehicles, people, animals) that approach the perimeter of the site and classify the nature of those targets so that they can be handled appropriately. Due to idiosyncrasies of the perimeter surveillance problem (e.g., clutter characteristics, target types, motion models, fusion issues), algorithms developed for wide-area surveillance may not be suitable for site protection. By understanding these idiosyncrasies and taking advantage of them through the incorporation of prior information into the signal and data processing algorithms, it is possible to get better detection, tracking, fusion and classification performance in perimeter surveillance. In this project, we propose to develop new detection, tracking, fusion and classification algorithms for site and asset protection using multiple perimeter surveillance radar (PSR) systems in partnership with our industrial partner ICx Radar Systems. In particular, we plan to focus on the following areas: 1) Clutter modeling and rejection algorithms, 2) Track-before-detect algorithms for site protection, 3) Tracking and fusion algorithms in ground, sea and littoral environments, 4) Target classification and behavior analysis algorithms, and 5) Computational issues and demonstration on real data. The significance of the proposed work will be that it will result in better algorithms that can a) work in high-density, highly structured and time-varying clutter that is prevalent in site protection problems, b) track accurately different types of targets that may approach the site, c) identify those targets' types and predict their intent effectively, d) and fuse returns and tracks from multiple PSR systems in order to improve tracking and classification results. The project will also support the training of highly qualified personnel (HQP) in areas of significant interest to Canada.","Information systems and technology","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Kirubarajan, Thia","CRDPJ ","Radar and navigation","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",2-4
"The problem of multisensor-multitarget tracking involves the utilization of sensor detections to estimate the state (e.g., position and velocity) of an unknown number of mobile or stationary objects (the targets) with possibly different dynamics. Multi-object tracking has applications in defence (e.g., air defence), communications (e.g., mobile user tracking), signal processing (e.g., signal source separation) and biomedical engineering (e.g., EEG signal analysis). Standard techniques for state estimation assume linear state evolution and state-to-measurement equations. They also assume Gaussian noise in the measurement process and state dynamics. In the presence of nonlinearities and non-Gaussian noise, the performance of classical methods degrades, often to the point of complete breakdown. Nonlinear algorithms are the alternative to the classical Kalman filter and its linearized variants for handling nonlinear state/measurement models and/or non-Gaussian noise. In particular, Monte Carlo (random) sampling based methods like particle filtering, finite set statistics tracking and joint multitarget probability density tracking have become some of the possible ways to approximate nonlinear filtering, the optimal form of which is computationally infeasible. 



The objective of the proposed work is to develop advanced algorithms to solve a number of specific problems in nonlinear state estimation in the presence of model uncertainties with application to target tracking, communications and biomedical engineering. The fundamental characteristics of the new algorithms will be computational efficiency in realistic problems with many objects to track. In addition to nonlinear state estimation algorithms, performance bounds that quantify the best accuracy obtainable by any algorithm, in specific problems with model uncertainties, non-Gaussian noise and nonlinear state models, will be derived as well. Performance evaluation through theoretical as well as experimental means will be carried out to validate the usefulness of the new algorithms.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Kirubarajan, Thia","RGPIN ","Radar and navigation","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",3-5
"Surveillance of Canada's extensive air, sea and ground boundaries plays a vital role in the defense of the nation. Tracking the motion of incoming and outgoing air, sea, ground and space objects (or targets), fusing the information from a multitude of sensor resources like radar, sonar, satellites and video, and identifying the targets' types and intentions are integral parts of surveillance. While there have been significant algorithm developments in target tracking over a number of years, the problem itself has become more complicated because of the availability of a large number and variety of new sensors, presence of highly agile and stealthy targets and the urgent need to detect, identify and track targets more accurately than ever before.



In this project, we propose to develop new efficient and robust algorithms that will address a number of important theoretical issues and provide effective solutions to a number of practical problems in multisensor-multitarget surveillance in partnership with the Defence Research Development Canada - DRDC - (Ottawa) of the Department of National Defence (DND) and General Dynamics Canada (GDC). Efficiency in large-scale scenarios and robustness against inherent uncertainties will be the cornerstone of the proposed work. In particular, we plan to focus on the following areas: 1) Integrated signal processing and tracking algorithms, 2) Information-aided tracking, 3) Filtering and data association algorithms, 4) Sensor, data and computational resource management, and 5) Computational issues and demonstration on real data. The above represent some of the most important research aspects in multisensor-multitarget tracking with direct and immediate benefit to the national defence interests of Canada as well as the commercial needs of GDC. In addition, the output from this research can also be used in civilian applications like wireless communications, biomedical engineering and industrial engineering. The project will also support the training of highly qualified personnel in areas of significant interest to Canada.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Kirubarajan, Thia","DNDPJ ","Radar and navigation","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique","2 & 3-4"

"Reducing the overall mass of automobiles by the use of lightweight alloys is one of the means by which improved fuel efficiency and reduced harmful emissions can be attained. Mg alloy components, with their high specific strength and stiffness, provide significant opportunities to achieve these goals. However, there are two major technological issues preventing widespread application of wrought Mg alloy products, namely the relatively low production rate and the development of new alloys with a combination of high strength, high ductility and high corrosion resistance. The proposed research program will develop strategies to improve the corrosion resistance by achieving an improved understanding and prediction of the environmental degradation associated with wrought Mg-Al-Zn alloys. To this end, the research will characterize and elucidate the influence of (1) crystallographic orientation on the structure, composition and stability of the quasi-passive film formed on unalloyed single crystal and polycrystalline Mg, and (2) composition, size & distribution of intermetallic phases on the micro-galvanic activity in polycrystalline Mg-Al-Zn alloys, as a function of the alloy content, and the thermomechanical processing route (sheet, extrusions and forgings). An encompassing combination of micro- and nano-scale resolution probe techniques will be utilized to achieve these goals. Structural and compositional information on the matrix, intermetallic phases and passive film will be obtained using high resolution electron microscopy, whereas the localized electrochemical activity of the matrix and intermetallic phases will be obtained using high resolution scanning electrochemical probe techniques (SKP and SVP). A minimum of three HQP will be trained in this proposal. In addition to helping the industry attain their weight reduction targets for fuel economy, emissions and performance, the technology developed with the HQP will create a Canadian ""know-how"" that will effectively support innovation efforts of domestic suppliers.","Materials performance","Construction, urban and rural planning","Materials Science and Engineering","Kish, Joseph","RGPIN ","Materials structure, properties and testing","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",1-5

"I propose to continue my investigation of both the analytic and arithmetic invariants of the L-functions  (and their twists) attached to elliptic curves over the rational field.  

 

In [FKK], it is proved that the central value vanishes for an infinite number of cubic (order 3) twists, for most (conjecturally all) elliptic curves defined over the rational field. In certain cases, lower bounds for the frequency of vanishing were proved which approach (remarkably closely) to the  values predicted by ``random matrix theory'' obtained in [DFK1]. 



In recent work, I have undertaken a study of the critical value of the derivative of twisted elliptic L-functions in the case that the twisted L-function vanishes to rank 1. Computational evidence was found [FK] supporting the existence of a remarkable ``algebraic part''  of these values which show hoped for Galois equivariance after ``factoring the elliptic regulator.'' This is predicted by the ``Equivariant Tamagawa Number Conjecture''.



 A related problem is that of establishing (when feasible) the non-vanishing of the central value of twisted L-functions. Although this is probably the more common state, it seems very difficult to establish in either its analytic or its algebraic form.

"In this proposed 5-year project, in collaboration with Rio Tinto Alcan, we will extend fundamental knowledge and develop physicochemical models for the dissolution of alumina and behaviour of the side-ledge (freeze) in Hall-H�roult aluminium electrolysis cells, using both experimental methods and modeling from basic principles.

Dissolution and distribution of alumina in the molten electrolyte (bath) is a very limiting factor in the stable operation and in the improvement of energy efficiency of the Hall-H�roult process. The side-ledge is formed on the sidewall by extracting heat and solidifying a part of the bath. Its thickness can vary much as non steady-state events occur (anode effect, alumina feeding, anode change, tapping). The presence of the ledge on the sidewall protects the integrity of the cell and improves the service life of the cells by improving the thermal stability during the transients. The alumina transport and ledge dynamics are strongly coupled by the thermal and physicochemical mechanisms present in the molten electrolyte. Measurements and modeling of the alumina distribution and side-ledge behaviour will give Rio Tinto Alcan the necessary tools for improved simulation, operation and cell design. Rio Tinto Alcan produces two million tons of aluminium in Hall-H�roult cells in Canada every year and the international competition, especially from Russia and fast emerging Asian economies is now very strong. The proposed experimental study and modeling of alumina dissolution and side-ledge behaviour will provide a unique advantage to Rio Tinto Alcan both by improving of the energy consumption and by reducing of the pollution of the environment.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Sciences appliqu�es","Kiss, Laszlo","CRDPJ ",Metallurgy,"Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",1-5

"A promising practical approach to nanostructured materials is to use building blocks with the dimensions optimized with respect to desired structural elements, i.e. nanoscale building blocks (NBBs). Discrete NBBs themselves display many unique characteristics, whereas periodic nanostructures built out of NBBs offer a tremendous potential in realizing novel functions. NBB can be compared to Lego: both can build amazingly sophisticated architectures. At the same time, great precision is required for manufacturing (synthesis) of the blocks and a significant diversity of blocks is needed to make them universal structural units (NBBs).

  The proposed research focuses on the synthesis of NBBs with precisely controlled properties, such as size, shape, chirality, and formation of functional nanocomposites out of these NBBs via self-assembly. Recently, the applicant's group was successful in creating a variety of monodisperse NBBs: silver nanoshapes including decahedra, faceted pentagonal rods, platelets, cubes and right bipyramids, chiral silver nanoclusters, and silica nanospheres for templating. Functional properties of these building blocks include narrow plasmonic absorption of silver decahedra, precisely tuneable from visible to NIR plasmons of faceted rods, and atomic-like discrete absorption and circular dichroism of silver nanoclusters. 

  The immediate research plans are to further diversify the library of the building blocks perfecting silver icosahedra (as the most spherical Platonic shape) and optimize preparation of gold shells using silver galvanic replacement (the metal shells are very versatile NBBs that are currently actively tested in biodiagnostics and medical treatment). Next, more complex core-shell NBBs will be prepared for protection of existing properties and realizing new functions by tailoring the outer layers. These diverse functional NBBs will be assembled into highly-ordered nanostructured functional materials. Advanced applications of the proposed NBBs and nanostructured materials include sensors (based on plasmons and Raman scattering), heterogeneous catalysis (advantageous due to defined surface facets and chirality), metamaterials and plasmonics (optical elements).

"The achievment of next generation flexible display and solar cell technologies will depend on the availability of robust semiconductor elements which are compatible with flexible substrates.  The approach taken in this research is to use inorganic semiconductors and embed them into a low cost polymer sheet. 

   For low cost flexible solar cells, thin (100 micron thick) silicon chips will be grown by an edge-fed liquid phase epitaxy process.  In this growth method, silicon atoms are mixed with tin atoms to form a silicon-tin solution.  The solution has a low melting point of below 600C, and if the molten solution is placed onto a crystalline silicon surface, growth of high purity single crystal silicon may be realized.  This approach has the advantage of high efficiency ( up to 20% converson efficiency) which is comparable to today's best non-flexible silicon solar cells. 

  For full color flexible displays, a technology that achieves the picture performance of today's liquid crystal televisions is required, in combination with their new attributes of low weight and high flexiblility.  Highly efficient and moisture insensitive gallium-indium nitride materials will be grown to form sub-micron-sized light emitting diodes.  A growth method called metal-organic chemical vapour deposition will be used to dissociate organometallic molecules such as trimethylgallium and grow tiny semiconductor columns forming diode-type light emitters, or light emitting diodes that can be embedded into plastic sheets and interconnected to form television screens.","Energy storage and conversion","Energy resources","Engineering Physics","Kitai, Adrian","RGPIN ",Semiconductors,"Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",1-5

"Air-cooled fuel cell systems (ACS), based on commonly employed polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell

(PEMFC) technology, represent a major commercial product category for the Canadian fuel cell industry. The

inexpensive, scalable ACS design utilizes the reactant air stream for stack cooling purposes and thus eliminates

many of the auxiliary systems required for conventional fuel cell designs. ACS are particularly attractive for the

multi-billion dollar backup power market segment, where fuel cell solutions have several advantages over

conventional lead-acid batteries and diesel generators, including extended runtime, high reliability, high

efficiency, lifetime cost savings and reduced environmental impact. The highly demanding operating

conditions of ACS are however not ideal for fuel cell systems and impose a significant challenge for system

designers. Both power output and durability are presently constrained by frequent issues related to overheating

and membrane dry-out.

The overall objective of the proposed research partnership is to enhance the performance of ACS by

implementing advanced thermal management methods. The research agenda brings together researchers in

thermal fluids systems and fuel cell technology at Simon Fraser University with leading technical experts at

Ballard Power Systems. Innovative stack cooling strategies with inspiration from air-cooled heat exchangers

and microelectronics cooling techniques will be evaluated to increase the heat rejection capacity of the stack. In

addition to enhancing the power output, an improved thermal management system can prevent failures caused

by thermal and hydration gradients and slow down many of the commonly encountered degradation

mechanisms, thereby improving the overall durability and cost effectiveness. The proposed research also aims

to develop fundamental modeling tools to aid fuel cell developers such as Ballard in the design of stack and

cell architectures with improved performance, and to reduce the cost and resources required for future fuel cell

development activities.

"The spatial resolution of large scale numerical models for climate simulations and weather prediction is too coarse to represent the small-scale nonhydrostatic processes that are responsible for the major part of the vertical transport of momentum and heat in the atmosphere. My  research employs various numerical models to study small-scale disturbances in the atmosphere. The primary objectives are to improve our understanding of the complex interactions between small-scale internal wave processes and the large-scale circulation, and to facilitate improved representations of these processes in large-scale atmosphere-ocean models.  Canada has a critical need for work in this area since the drag exerted by breaking small-scale gravity waves is, along with radiative processes such as  ultraviolet absorption in the ozone layer, one of the dominant factors in determining the circulation of the middle atmosphere (roughly 10 to 90 km above mean sea level). Small-scale internal gravity waves also play a prominent role in mesoscale processes, e.g. the development of severe windstorms that form in the lee of mountain ranges, the development of turbulent layers encountered by aircraft, and in the organization of severe thunderstorms. My research will therefore also have an impact in mesoscale forecasting.                                                                    

Our understanding of small-scale processes is far from complete and, in particular, the mechanisms through which gravity waves interact with the large-scale flow are still being hotly debated. My most recent work is making important contributions to this debate -- it demonstrates that one representation of wave-wave interactions (Doppler spreading) is based on a seriously flawed theoretical model that violates conservation of mass and thermodynamic energy. This flawed representation of nonorographic gravity wave drag is currently employed in Canadian numerical weather prediction and climate models (as well as many other models used around the world), and needs to be replaced with an alternative based on sound physics.

"Secondary reactions to drugs represent a class of diseases that are often neglected in the clinic and therefore rarely registered. Despite that symptoms may cease when the treatment is interrupted, their significance has been emphasized in a recent report to be among the top six leading causes of fatality. Owing to a continuous increase in consummation and extensive variety of drugs available on the market, such reactions are prone to become a serious problem for the society. Surprisingly many allergic skin reactions are caused by the ingestion of numerous drugs. It is believed that, for a drug to cause an immune-mediated secondary reaction, at least two major events have to take place. First, the drug must be converted into a reactive compound that can modify essential macromolecules such as proteins. Secondly, a cellular stress should be present. This may be caused by either up or down regulation of cellular proteins or by differential post translational modification. While information about the proteins that are targeted in these processes is a crucial step in understanding the molecular mechanism behind secondary drug reactions, only limited data have so far been obtained. This has mainly been due to a lack of sensitive analytical approaches. However, with recent progress in electrophoresis, nanoliquid chromatography and state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, the techniques required are available but innovative approaches need to be developed and evaluated. Therefore, new strategies based on mass spectrometry and modern separation methods will be developed and applied to study the mechanism of immune-mediated adverse skin reactions caused by reverse transcription inhibitor drugs. These are drugs that are widely used for treatment of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus. In certain cases up to 16% of these patients develop skin allergy reactions that in severe cases result in death. The new strategies that will be developed and applied are anticipated to become important tools to advance our knowledge about the mechanisms involved in drug induced adverse skin reactions.

"Most biological processes, including the immune response, cell-cell communication, inflammation and bacterial and viral infections, involve the association of biomolecules to form specific, non-covalent complexes. The structure and stability of these complexes are determined by the concerted action of many forces (e.g. hydrogen bonds, ionic and van der Waals interactions) between binding partners and from the displacement and reorganization of solvent molecules associated with the solvent shell of the binding partners. An understanding of these forces and the structures they lead to is essential to a complete understanding of biological processes.  Research in our laboratory focuses on the development and application of mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques to detect specific, non-covalent protein complexes (e.g. protein-ligand and multi-protein complexes) in vitro and to characterize their structure and stability in solution and the gas phase. This proposal describes the development of novel experimental methodologies, based on the electrospray ionization (ES)-MS technique, to quantify the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for non-covalent protein interactions in solution. Specifically, we will develop a direct and sensitive ES-MS approach to quantify the thermodynamic parameters for protein interactions with macromolecules (e.g. proteins and other biopolymers). We will also develop a new method, based on the temperature-jump relaxation approach and ES-MS, to quantify the kinetic parameters for non-covalent protein interactions. The kinetic and thermodynamic data available from these and other methods will allow us to develop a more detailed picture of the structure-function relationships that underlie protein recognition in solution. We will also explore the structure of desolvated non-covalent protein complexes using infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. In particular, we will assess the ability of this technique to probe the nature of intermolecular interactions within the gaseous protein complexes. From a comparison of the interactions identified in solution in the gas phase, new insights into the role of solvent in biological recognition will be gained.

"The neurodegenerative disorders of humans (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and animals (e.g. scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy) are characterised by irreversible loss of neurons. The non-neuronal cells in the brain, including microglia and astrocytes, can affect neuronal survival significantly. They do so by secreting various mediators that either enhance neuronal survival (i.e. neurotrophic factors) or cause neuronal death (i.e. neurotoxins). Furthermore, when these cells become activated, the repertoire of neuroactive molecules that they secrete may depend not only on the type of stimulus they encounter but also on the species of origin of the cells. Thus far, no systematic study has explored this aspect of glia-neuron signaling. Furthermore, there are glial mediators that have not been described yet. The proposed research will address these issues by studying secretions of microglial cells and astrocytes from humans and several other mammals, including rats, mice, pigs and sheep. I will analyse neuroactive products that are released by these cells after their exposure to several stimulants that are relevant to both human and animal neurodegenerative pathology and inflammatory mechanisms. I will also investigate the secretory arsenal of several glia-like cell lines to assess their usefulness as models of primary glial cells and I will search for novel, yet unidentified, neuroactive products of glial cells by using an unbiased proteomics technique. The proposed research program will answer a fundamental biological question about whether there are essential differences between glial cells from different species in their secretory responses to specific stimuli. An important practical application, crucial to an effective drug discovery process and translational research for human and animal neurodegenerative diseases, will be identification of the most appropriate in vitro model systems and species suitable for such research. These model systems could be used by other researchers to develop drugs with beneficial action in various neurodegenerative disorders of humans and animals, which could have substantial economic as well as health benefits to Canada.

"The proposed NSERC Photovoltaic Innovation Network is comprised of 29 top scientists and engineers working in the field of advanced solar cell research, in 13 universities across Canada. The Network has strong support from partners in the private and public sector in Canada, who together aim to raise the status of solar photovoltaics (PV) as a renewable energy option in Canada by accelerating research and development, thereby translating this work into successful commercialization outcomes. In particular, the Network will develop new Intellectual Property in PV for adoption by Canadian industry to supply strong domestic demand (currently met by foreign companies) and to compete in a rapidly growing global marketplace. The Network will intensively train 88 research personnel over 5 years, providing highly skilled and creative employees to fill positions in industry and academia. PV cells convert light from the broad solar spectrum directly to electricity, with the

energy conversion efficiency and cost (in $/W) being the most important device metrics. The proposed collaborative and multi-disciplinary research program has the specific objectives of increasing the device conversion efficiency and/or reducing the device cost to make large scale PV deployment more competitive vs. electricity generation from fossil fuels. Four central research themes have been identified with promising new approaches; a) organic devices with inherently low costs of materials and manufacturing, b) inorganic devices which to date are the mostly widely deployed (through either Silicon-based solar panels) and have achieved record efficiencies (through multi-junction based concentrator systems), c) hybrid organic/inorganic devices with the potential to combine the lower costs of organic devices with the higher efficiencies of inorganic devices and d) new PV devices and architectures which take advantage of the unique properties of nano-structured materials. Transparent solar cells optimized for integration into house or building windows and socioeconomic factors related to adoption of PV technology will also be considered.

"The Canadian mining industry is faced with the recovery of metals from deposits with increasingly complex mineralogy.  To exploit these ores, mineral processing must liberate the valuable minerals using ultra-fine grinding followed by their concentration using flotation.  Comminution to fine particle sizes requires large amounts of energy and specialized flotation separation technologies often making processing unpractical or uneconomic.



The proposed research is based on previous studies supported by NSERC and industry and is aimed at advancing ultra-fine grinding technologies.  Previous studies by the researcher have focused on investigating the effect of operating variables on energy usage and parameters that influence downstream processing. 



Funding will support two interrelated fundamental research studies that will ultimately result in improved design and operation of fine grinding technologies and lower energy usage.  The first study is aimed at advancing the fundamental relationship between power input, energy intensity and particle breakage.  The second study will develop criteria for the selection of comminution operating conditions for a range of ore mineralogies.  The research will define parameters that can be used to support other research to model comminution in high speed stirred mills.

"Our studies take advantage of the linguistic environment of Quebec to look at the brain regions involved in different aspects of language processing in the mother tongue and second languages. We use several methods of investigation (behavioural studies and functional and anatomical brain imaging techniques) and study right-handed monolingual and bilingual volunteers, to explore how learning a specific skill during childhood may determine the functional organization of the adult brain. Our overall goal is to understand the network of brain regions that mediate processing of the sound code, meaning and grammar in our mother tongue and in subsequently learned languages. The research planned seeks to establish to what extent new or expanded cortical regions are recruited during second language acquisition. By studying the organization of the language systems of the brain in adults who have had different and specific alterations of language experience, this approach should reveal neural systems that mediate language and throws light on the debate about 'critical periods' in language acquisition. The outcome of these experiments should also enable us to design more appropriate intervention strategies for individuals who have suffered brain damage close to important language areas.

"More than half of all the energy generated by mankind, is transformed into waste heat. Considering the

continuously increasing energy demands of our society, recovering part of the waste heat - normally lost -

would be extremely beneficial, both for our society and for the environment. As proven by first field tests in

the U.S., thermoelectric materials are capable of recovering energy from the waste heat of the exhaust gases of

automotives More than 40% of the energy created by the gas combustion in automotives go directly into

exhaust heat, which may be used to create the temperature gradient for the TE generator. The TE generator, in

turn, can then supply energy towards the accessories of the automotive, or directly replace the alternator, or

propel an electrical engine in a hybrid.

Hence, an enormous potential for fuel economy improvements is evident. Current materials would only be

capable to recover about 5% of the waste heat energy, therefore this technology has not yet found widespread

applications in automotives. This project is concerned with developing advanced TE materials that will exhibit

better thermoelectric efficiency. Higher efficiency of the TE conversion will ultimately lead to enhanced fuel

economy improvements, making the additional costs of installing TE generators into automotives worthwhile.

Developing enhanced materials with e.g. a ZT value of 2 would improve the efficiency to 14%, thus yielding

substantial fuel economy improvements of more than 10%.

"Nanomaterials with well-defined pores in the range of 1-100 nm, e.g. nanopores, are of special interest because of wide perspective of applications in environmental remediation, clean industrial catalysis, miniaturized electronic, magnetic or optical devices, and biocompatible transport systems. Ordered mesoporous materials, in particular, are defined as inorganic frameworks containing periodic arrays of large channels or cages comprised between 2 and 15 nm. Although substantial research efforts have been directed on studying these solids, further improvements aiming at designed synthesis, tailored functionalization, and characterization are still much needed. The primary objective of this program is to design specific mesoporous hybrid materials incorporating desirable functional groups with adequate structure and porosity for selective sorption/separation applications, heterogeneous catalysis, and biotechnological applications. This program follows research efforts initiated by us on the synthesis of functional mesoporous solids and their detailed characterization by adsorption methods. The research is oriented towards developing methodologies for the preparation and the functionalization of mesoporous materials comprising inorganic and organic components assembled at the nanoscale with optimal control of environment and spatial positioning of groups. Emphasis will also be put on assessing the performance of given functionalized materials for targeted applications and their adsorption behavior. Ordered mesoporous silica hosts offer high stability and diversity in framework structure, facilitating control of the disposition of guests. Depending on the targeted properties, different functionalization approaches will be applied (e.g. insertion of functional polymers, post-grafting with spatial positioning). Adsorption properties of the resulting porous solids will be studied by advanced gas adsorption analyses using different probes e.g. nitrogen, argon, CO2 , water, supplemented with studies of adsorption from liquid solutions. In addition to the technological aspects, the research program emphasizes fundamental understanding of host-guest interactions within solid matrices and adsorption phenomena at the nanoscale.

"Foreign object damage to the airfoils of impellers and bladed disks can often be weld-repaired and then reshaped to restore the airfoil profile.  However, there is presently no repair method available for impellers, bladed discs and other components which possess an erosion-resistant coating, ERC. The coating may only be removed by a blasting technique that can easily result in the removal of substantial amounts of the underlying material, while damaging the part beyond acceptable repair limits.



The aerospace industry is currently seeking new methods for ERC stripping. This would help reducing the maintenance cost of jet engines and would make the repair of the coated components possible and therefore reduce the yield of the manufacturing process. Two important issues in the etching process of hard coatings are of particular concern: 

(1) Etching selectivity: the reagent should react only with the coating to be removed but not with the underlying material.

(2) Environmental considerations: the stripping process must be environmentally friendly. The reagent as well as the etched coating materials should not be of threat to the environment.

"Most old-growth forests in Canada have been destroyed and restoration efforts have produced systems that look and function very differently than the original. This is because the mechanisms that regulate the developmental stages of a forest are poorly understood. There is increasing evidence that the large diversity of organisms living in soils not only play roles in nutrient cycling but also interact very closely with plants. Many of these interactions determine the diversity and productivity of plants and some have attracted the interest of biotechnology companies, which have been using them in forest restoration efforts. In Northern Canada, many hectares affected by mining practices have been planted with alders, a tree that forms symbioses simultaneously with mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen fixing microbes. Our project aims to assess the impact of restoration efforts using alders colonized with different mycorrhizal inocula on the establishment and survival of plants typical of undisturbed forest systems. The effects of our interventions on ecosystem functioning, including potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, contaminant remediation, carbon sequestration and soil microbial and plant community biodiversity will also be considered. We will link the biological and physicochemical components using molecular and micrometeorological techniques in our measurements. The former are ideal to characterize microbial diversity and function and the latter to characterize the temporal dynamics of GHG emissions. Additionally, we will measure nutrient transfer between plants through mycorrhizal networks and different pools of carbon, including glomalin, a compound produced by some mycorrhizal fungi that is important in soil structure and long-term C sequestration.

"Principles and methods of modern organic chemistry will be used to elucidate biochemical processes and to use analogues of such processes to achieve organic chemical transformations. By using organic chemistry, we design new molecules that test specific concepts and provide new materials that answer critical questions. The project has three main areas: (1) catalysis in the biochemical generation and utilization of carbon dioxide (2) development of efficient routes to unnatural aminoacyl t-RNA (3) modification of carbohydrates in water. In area 1, we have found that the release of carbon dioxide can depend on how fast it escapes from its site of formation, rather than how fast bonds break to form it. This goes against the previously established ideas. This will change how people evaluate the biological generation of carbon dioxide. We have developed a new method to do this quantitatively based on methods. In area 2, we have found the combination of metal and precursor that are driected to a single critical site in the complex RNA molecule, the site where nature activates amino acids for incorporation into proteins. With RNA modified in this way, we can build proteins with new components. We are improving the basic techniques and developing the methods for incorporation. In area 3, we have learned how to modify sugars in water, rather than organic solvents. We find that the specific site of reaction is controlled by unusual factors which permit us to create new carbohydrates derivatives without resort to environmentally harnful solvents.

"Given the rapid growth in consumer wireless devices, such as cell phones and personal digital assistants, location-based services have become of increasing interest to consumers.  Such services include enhanced 911, mapping and directions to locations of interest, and the tracking of people and assets.  A number of technologies have been developed to estimate the position of wireless devices.  Perhaps the most widespread and mature is the Global Positioning System (GPS).  The potential of other technologies, such as ultrawideband (UWB) communications and wireless local area networks (WLAN), to estimate the position of a user, are still being investigated.



Regardless of the technology employed to estimate the position of a wireless device, an accurate and reliable position estimate is required no matter what type of environment the device finds itself in.  Unfortunately, no one type of technology is, at this time, able to perform consistently in all environments.  In fact many of these technologies are complimentary in terms of environment - some working better indoors whereas others perform better outdoors.  As a result, an integration of technologies is required for a truly ubiquitous positioning system.



Their are two primary objectives for this research program.  The first is to implement, analyze and improve upon positioning technologies such as GPS, UWB and WLAN in especially challenging environments.  Secondly, an overall navigation algorithm will be developed.  This algorithm will integrate measurements from a number of technologies in order to generate the best possible position estimate.

"Radio frequency (RF) wireless systems are constantly being pushed to higher frequencies, while continuing trends towards ever smaller, more power efficient, and cheaper wireless devices are severely challenging traditional technologies. RF micro-electro-mechanical-systems (RF MEMS) devices can offer improved isolation, lower power dissipation, and reduced size and weight, and are poised to replace conventional devices and even enable new circuit architectures in future wireless applications.



Fabrication of RF MEMS devices is typically based on surface microfabrication techniques, restricting devices to flat 2D structures. Synchrotron-based deep X-ray lithography (XRL) is a fundamentally different microfabrication approach, enabling 3D vertical wall structures with heights of hundreds of microns or even millimetres. Exploiting the 3rd dimension offers tremendous opportunity for novel RF devices, and Dr. Klymyshyn's group has adapted synchrotron XRL processes to produce high-performance RF coupler, resonator, and variable impedance structures. The research program is unique in Canada, and also an international collaboration between USaskatchewan, TRLabs, and the Inst. of Microstructure Technology, Research Center Karlsruhe (FZK), Germany.



Research will continue to develop new vertical RF MEMS devices, and also extend these to more complicated circuits such as filters and diplexers to produce entirely new structures. The research will also assist in developing Canada's first XRL facility (SyLMAND - Synchrotron Laboratory for Micro/Nano Devices), at the Canadian Light Source, one of the largest scientific projects in Canada. Currently under construction, SyLMAND will provide the unique capabilities of XRL to Canadian researchers for applications in many fields including telecom, aerospace, sensing, microfluidics, and medicine.

"Old boreal forests have recently been shown to be the rule rather than the exception in many parts of the world. This is because fires, although spectacular do not regularly affect large areas of the forest, especially in eastern North America.  Instead these forests are affected by other disturbances. These partial disturbances (such as insect outbreaks, windthrow, and old-age related mortality) release resources that will allow different species to recruit. Differences in disturbance frequency, size and the number and species of trees killed will affect recruitment and tree diversity. However, disturbances alone will probably not be the only factor affecting tree diversity of boreal mixedwoods. It is expected that there will be an interaction between disturbances and site productivity. In other words, when soil productivity is low few species should be able to recruit whereas when productivity is high then disturbances will permit different species to recruit depending on their needs for soil resources or above ground resources such as light. Understanding these interactions is important as boreal mixedwood forests are under great pressure from climate change and human activities such as timber harvesting. My research will thus focus on how tree species composition changes with different severity and frequency of partial disturbances along a site productivity gradient. I hypothesise that a varying frequency of different severity disturbances will create temporal niches for the recruitment of long-lived species with specific establishment needs that would otherwise be excluded from intact forests. It is also expected that such disturbance mediated diversity will be greatest on high productivity sites. Although such research has been conducted in temperate and tropical forests it has basically been ignored in boreal regions despite the importance of this forest. My work will focus on the transitional boreal mixedwoods as this region encompasses the greatest tree diversity and being a transition zone is also under the greatest risk of change (i.e. in disturbance regimes, etc) to climatic factors. This research will be based on a combination of aerial photographic analysis, dendroecological analysis and modeling.

"The proposed research program will investigate methods to improve the efficiency of electrical energy conversion technologies and investigate novel approaches and applications of electrical energy conversion technology as a replacement for other, less efficient techniques. The focus of the research program in the short term will be to consider electro-mechanical energy conversion such as motors, generators and actuators. In the longer term, it is envisaged that the research scope will broaden to incorporate comparisons with other energy conversion technologies, especially as they relate to electrical energy storage and clean energy technology. 

Significant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada are related to losses in electrical energy conversion systems and inefficient non-electrical systems that could be replaced by new electrical technologies. Addressing these areas to improve energy efficiency at little or no incremental cost to the end user achieves two important goals: reduced total energy use and consequent greenhouse gas emission; improved competitiveness in the Canadian economy due to reductions in operating costs.

This research program will address fundamental issues related to the mechanisms that causes power losses in electrical equipment. New models for losses will be developed and tested; their publication and use in industry will enable the minimisation of losses in future generations of equipment. In addition to broad-based fundamental research, specific application areas will be addressed. Two possible areas to be considered include the efficient use of electric drives for electric and hybrid vehicles and new techniques to harvest energy from small energy sources to enhance battery life. 

Through a combination of computer aided design and hands-on construction of prototypes,the research program will involve significant training of highly qualified engineers to carry out the next generation of research in industry.

"This research will examine the statistical properties of various financial econometric models along with their associated estimators. In particular there will be two broad areas examined:

a)models dealing with optimal portfolio allocation.

Here the aim is to examine the distribution of the optimal portfolio weights or some scalar function of these weights. Since the weights are the result of a parametric quadratic programming problem, their properties are usually examined via Monte Carlo simulation. Past simulation studies have shown that the weights are usually severly biased. In order to ascertain the source of the bias and hence ways to reduce it one needs to consider the exact moments and the exact distribution of the weights.

The research will consider various multivariate distributional assumptions on the vector of asset returns along with realistic and practically relevant constraints on the weights. While some progress has been made in simple cases under multivariate normality other distributional assumptions and non-negativity constraints have not been considered; these will be the subject of this research.

b)models involving stochastic volatility.

The research here will examine stochastic volatility (SV) models formulated in both discrete and continuous time. These models have, for many years, posed a major challenge to econometricians since their formulation involves an unobserved (latent) variable, the volatility. From a practical point there have been many alternative specifications each claiming to better capture various stylized facts of the data. Detailed analytical statistical analysis of many of these models has not been undertaken. Consequently, this section of the proposed research will aim to systematically examine these models, deriving exact statistical properties such as moments and characteristic functions. The results will enable a clearer understanding of the dynamics of these models and lead to improved estimation.

"This research proposal is aimed towards the fabrication of novel, silicon-based devices incorporating high levels of optical and electrical functionality integrated on a single silicon chip. The choice of silicon as the base material for integrated optoelectronic circuits exploits the established global infrastructure for electronic device manufacture. The successful integration of both optical and electronic functionality will have significant ramifications for a number of industries and applications such as microelectronics, telecommunications, clean energy technologies and bio- and chemical sensing. The current work proposed here will focus specifically on the development of functionality such as: light emission from nano-structured silicon; fast optical-to-electrical-conversion for waveguide integrated photodetectors; and efficient broadband modulation without recourse to Mach-Zehnder geometries.  This functionality will be achieved using lattice scale modification via defect and dopant engineering of crystalline silicon and silicon-based dielectrics. The primary tool for this manipulation at the atomic scale is ion implantation in combination with thermal annealing, however an array of fabrication and characterization techniques will be employed throughout the proposed plan of work, all of which are available to the applicant at the home institution or via collaborators both within and external to Canada. The proposal builds upon knowledge previously obtained in the applicant's research group, while simultaneously setting challenging goals requiring methodology which will be world leading in its novelty. The training of students is a significant motivation. Knowledge of photonic and semiconductor design, fabrication and characterization offers new, highly qualified personnel a vast array of career opportunities.

"New technology has enabled researchers to make movable structures with dimensions only tens of nanometers (hundreds of atoms) in size, called nanomechanical devices.  These can form new sensors with unprecedented sensitivity, such as microscopes that detect the magnetic force due to a single atom.

     One problem in using nanomechanical devices is reading out their motion:  most schemes used for larger devices don't work well at the nanometer scale.  One strategy is to couple the nanomechanical device with a nanoelectronic transducer fabricated on the same chip.  Prof. Knobel pioneered this field by constructing a vibrating nanomechanical beam coupled to an electronic amplifier called a single electron transistor (SET).  The SET is an exquisitely sensitive charge amplifier, which, when coupled to the beam, demonstrated some of the most sensitive measurements of nanoscale motion ever made.  

     Quantum mechanics, the modern theory of physics which describes how atoms and particles behave, limits the precision of any measurement.  The limit is both due to added output noise as well as to the measuring device's ""back-action"" on the object being measured.  While SETs have very low output noise, their back- action is larger than ideal.  A current challenge is to develop new amplifiers to replace SETs.  Prof. Knobel will engineer new ways of amplifying nanomechanical motion to study the quantum limits of measurement, to develop new instruments and to potentially bring a nanomechanical device into a quantum state itself.  The result of this will be better sensors and deeper insight into the mysteries of measurement in our quantum world.

     Prof. Knobel has built a well-equipped lab to make and study nanoscale mechanical and electronic devices.  He has supervised over 30 undergraduate and graduate students, training them in fabrication, cryogenics, sensitive electronic measurements and modeling of these devices.  In the coming years, the group will integrate nanomechanics new electronic devices, work to understand the back-action of the SET and implement feedback controlling nanomechanical motion.

"On a daily basis, we are faced with cluttered environments with sensory inputs that compete for our mental resources and, ultimately, for the control of behaviour. Coherent goal-directed behaviour relies on selection mechanisms in the brain to control the flow of these inputs by allocating attention to goal-relevant stimuli rather than to goal-irrelevant distractors. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter in the brain which is known to regulate ""selective attention"", but exactly how it accomplishes this is unclear. Some animal and human research suggests that acetylcholine may facilitate attention by amplifying relevant inputs in the sensory areas of the brain, thus making them easier to detect and discriminate from other (irrelevant) input. In contrast to this ""attentional facilitation"" hypothesis, other research suggests that acetylcholine may improve selective attention by actively suppressing the sensory impact of irrelevant stimuli. The objective of our research is to examine these two hypotheses by administering drugs which temporarily alter brain acetylcholine and examining how this alteration affects the processing of target and distractor information in auditory and visual tasks. In these studies, performance speed and accuracy will be assessed along with brain electrical activity which can help determine whether acetylcholine affects early (at the sensory level) or late (decision making level) processing stages. Acetylcholine will be manipulated by administering single doses of nicotine, a drug that increases levels of acetylcholine in the brain. As acetylcholine activates a number of different types of acetylcholine receptor systems, other studies will administer drugs which selectively block one or more of these receptors. Drugs will be administered in a double-blind design with placebo controls. This research will help to enlighten our knowledge of acetylcholine's role in human attention.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge","Psychology, School of","Knott, Verner","RGPIN ","Cognitive science -- other",Psychology,Psychologie,2-5

"Of the numerous questions that arise in the study of space, two recur time and again:  Why is the universe so highly structured?  And, how do plasmas in space become so energetic?  The fine structure of coronal loops and the million-Kelvin plasmas that populate them are prime examples.  While less widely appreciated, the auroral ionosphere is no exception.  In a system whose boundaries are measured in Earth radii, the dominant spatial scales of auroral forms range from tens of kilometers to tens of meters.  And, auroral plasmas at altitudes as low as 500 km have been observed to reach temperatures rivaling those of the solar corona.  In the aurora, both the high degree of structure and the surprisingly high energies owe their existence to electromagnetic forces, or more specifically to the interaction of the solar wind, the magnetosphere and the ionosphere through mega-Ampere-scale electric currents and the magnetic fields that thread them.





This proposal describes a collaborative research plan to explore the structuring, heating, and acceleration of auroral plasmas, bringing to bear a variety of techniques including suborbital sounding rockets, orbiting satellites, ground-based auroral observations, laboratory plasma studies, data analysis, and numerical simulation.

"Three projects are included in this research programme, all deal with the preparation and/or modification of thin films and surfaces with a view to device applications.

     Soft X-ray mirrors are used in space astronomy (particularly to study the sun), in synchrotrons, to manipulate their light which is used for a wide variety of applications, and in microlithography of semiconductor devices whose dimensions keep shrinking.  No single material can give significant reflectivity at normal or near-normal incidence (only at grazing incidence, which requires large surfaces and gives rise to large aberrations) at wavelengths shorter than about 30 nm.  However, multilayer mirrors, consisting of many periods of nanometer-sized thin layers of alternating absorbers and specers have been known to provide good reflection coefficients (nearing 70% in some cases).  We propse to extend our previous work in this area, by optimising the configurations of the alternating layers to yield higher reflectivity.  In addition, mirrors in the far uv (or EUV - extreme uv) which can be focussed, and which can resist contamination from residual hydrocarbons will be created.

     Liquid crystal (LC) devices are commonly used in displays.  The requirements for these devices to be ever more compact and thus use lower control voltages, placing stringent requirements on LC cells.  The long ""director"" molecules in a liquid crystal must first be aligned with a small ""pre-tilt"" angle before any voltage is applied, so that when the voltage is applied, the LCs will all line up parallel.  We will attempt to prepare surfaces that will favour this pre-alignment of the director molecules.

     Finally, efficient second-harmonic generation (SHG) of light will be produced using ""extreme poling"" in silica (glass).  The latter is lower in cost and higher in resistance to damage than most optical non-linear crystals such as lithium niobate.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Physique, g�nie physique et optique","Knystautas, �mile","RGPIN ",Physics,Physics,Physique,2-3

"Plants form the pillars of the Earth's life-supporting activities like photosynthesis, starch and oil production, and respiration.  These activities are governed by dynamic cellular processes, requiring interaction of countless molecular participants and take place in specialized spaces inside plant cells.  One such space is the plastid, an organelle designed for capturing and producing energy for plants.  Plastids must also adjust their activities during development and when adapting to the ever-changing environment.  Such adjustments are accompanied by dramatic shifts to the diversity of proteins being transported into plastids.  It is thus important for plastids to maintain a responsive and efficient protein transport process that can address all situations.  Recent findings indicate that the co-chaperone Tic40, a dynamic component of the plastid protein transport machinery, may be involved in the adjusting mechanisms and that Tic40's role(s) may be influenced or modulated by the activities of organellar rhomboid proteases.  This proposal thus outlines projects aimed at elucidating the role of Tic40 and rhomboid proteases in plastid protein transport.  Since rhomboid proteases belong to a group of highly conserved proteins involved in signaling and development, the long-term goals will be to define the Tic40-rhomboid protease link and the meaning of this relationship to plastid protein delivery, organelle biogenesis, cell structure, and development.  For the related short-term goals, we will employ established and modern proteomic approaches to characterize specifically : 1) Tic40's structure, its capabilities and its rhomboid cleavage site(s); 2) The functional features of plant organellar rhomboid proteases such as location, targeting, and enzymatic activities; and 3) The functional relationship between Tic40's importation and plastid rhomboid proteases.  The work will also contribute to the development of techniques and strategies for functional proteomics, whole cell research, and commercial applications.  Equally important, students going through the proposed 5-year NSERC program will receive intensive training in discoveries research applicable to their careers (for at least 3 Ph.D., 6 M.Sc., and 10 B.Sc.).

"Recently, there are significant demands for decimal arithmetic operations for many commercial applications, including financial analysis, tax calculation, phone billing, currency conversion, Internet based applications, and e-commerce. Consequently, specifications for decimal arithmetic operations have recently been added to the unapproved draft (as of Oct. 2006) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic. Binary floating-point arithmetic in hardware can handle decimal arithmetic-intensive applications, but decimal data can be more accurately represented by a decimal arithmetic unit. Since many decimal numbers cannot be exactly represented in binary, it is desirable to store data in a decimal format and process data using decimal arithmetic software. Even if decimal floating-point arithmetic software eliminates conversion errors, it is known that decimal floating-point software is typically 100 to 1,000 times slower than binary floating-point implemented in hardware. Therefore, there is need for hardware implementations of decimal floating-point arithmetic. Efficient hardware implementations of decimal floating-point arithmetic unit will be studied in this proposed research. The result of this research will improve the performance and the accuracy of many commercial applications significantly.



Floating-point hardware offers a wide dynamic range and high computation precision, yet occupies large fractions of total chip area and power consumption. Therefore its usage, especially in low-power applications, is limited. Many embedded microprocessors do not include a floating-point unit due to its unacceptable hardware cost. This proposed research will explore a way of reducing decimal floating-point hardware cost and power consumption by minimizing the bit-width representation of decimal floating-point data. The result of decimal floating-point bit width-reduction can deliver a significant hardware cost and power saving through the use of a minimized decimal bit-width floating-point unit.

"The research involved falls into three related fields of interest.



The first is systems in which quantum effects are important. Quantum theory has proven difficult to interpret, with properties such as ""being in two places at once"" being quite unintuitive. There has been experimental work recently though on systems, usually at low temperatures, for which quantum effects are pronounced. We will study examples of such systems, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, using finite temperature field theory in order to understand better the origin of their quantum properties. Attention will be paid to systems near a critical point, in which a sharp cross-over from one type of behavior to another occurs. 



The second area involves quantum computers and quantum information. During the development of quantum theory it was realized that a computer built on the principles of quantum mechanics could have a significant speed advantage over a classical computer, with recent experimental prototypes suggesting this is indeed the case. We shall examine models of algorithms used in quantum computation with a view towards understanding better which quantum effects are most responsible for the observed speed-up in the computations.



The final topic is systems in which non-linear effects are important. There are two properties of interest here: chaos (long-term unpredictability) and fractalness (self-similarity at different length scales). Such effects arise in many contexts, such as fluid flow, diffusion, chemical reactions, and biological processes. We shall examine a class of models of epidemic growth in a population, with attention paid to incorporating local interactions by analyzing such models on discrete networks. Due to the general nature, many of the tools of quantum theory, especially of systems near a critical point, will be of use.

"The majority of the international seismic design provisions, including the National Building Code of Canada (2005), employ the principles of capacity design to obtain structures capable of withstanding seismic solicitations. Although the main design objectives are usually achieved using this approach, the method presents several intrinsic inconsistencies. For instance, the procedures used to predict design values of displacements and deformations are not transparent and rely on somewhat artificial rules which fail to reflect the complex interactions that exist in actual structures. For certain structural systems, this can result in an important increase of structural mass without significantly improving the seismic behaviour.



The research program described herein aims to develop new design procedures for the seismic design of steel structures based on performance objectives. The studies will focus on (i) the definition of performance criteria and (ii) the preliminary development of design procedures. Initially seismic behaviour of eccentrically braced frames will be examined in the framework of the global structural response through extensive numerical studies and innovative experimental program using shaking table. In particular, the relationship between the inelastic shear link rotation and the inelastic storey drifts will be examined to define the drifts associated with specific link performance. Subsequently, different approaches to performance-based design will be assessed to determine the appropriate methodology for this system and to propose design procedures suitable for practical use. The results will help better understand the global behavior of buildings under seismic loads and contribute to develop Canadian code provisions for seismic design of steel structures.","Construction, urban and rural planning","Construction, urban and rural planning","G�nies Civil, g�ologique et des mines","Koboevic, Sanda","RGPIN ","Structural engineering","Structural engineering","G�nie des structures",3-5

"Complex systems and agent-based modeling are attracting a growing interest from experts from various disciplines to simulate and study real world applications. The implications are of significance because they broaden our understanding of little known complex social phenomena, including reasoning about the causes of

observed system behaviour and predicting the outcomes of tested case scenarios or interventions. Exciting systems that this field encompasses include: terrorist networks, prehistoric civilizations, and vehicle safety. An agent for instance can represent an individual, a household, or a driver. System designers often build a state

based configuration for agents to react in a dynamic environment. Hence, the model provides a sandbox approach for the researchers to test various hypotheses. For example, an ancient civilization can be modeled using real field data where an  archaeologist can then examine the effects on the emerging population size and

movement under drought conditions compared to normal conditions in order to test a hypothesis suggesting that a drought caused the population to leave the study area. The research program proposes applying new techniques in agent learning when developing agent behaviour in a complex system. Beyond the basic finite state machine that an agent can use to react to its dynamic environment, a more realistic approach for agent intelligence proposes reactive agents that can accumulate knowledge at the individual and population levels, learn new plans and evolve new strategies on their own to fulfill their goals. Human behaviour however, is distinguished from other animal behaviours and consequently the conventional evolutionary frameworks need to be extended in order to build more realistic artificial agents. Through the proposed methods, the outcome of this research program will enhance the learning theory in artificial models and researchers working with

agent-based simulations would be able to create more accurate and intelligent models using the algorithms from this work.","Computer software","Information and communication services","Computer Science, School of","Kobti, Ziad","RGPIN ","Learning and inference theories","Artificial intelligence","Intelligence artificielle",1-5
"When cylindrical structures in ocean engineering and undersea technology are exposed to ocean currents and/or waves, they may experience structural vibrations. One of these instabilities involves vortex shedding, which can cause a serious threat to the integrity and fatigue life of structure. This program of research focuses on the unsteady flow around a horizontal cylindrical body in the absence or presence of a free surface which is a classical topic within hydrodynamics. In nature, a special type of fluid boundary which separates two fluids with different physical properties, for example water and the air in the Earth's atmosphere is known as a free surface. Representative structures having cylindrical geometry include towing cables, which may be inclined at an angle with respect to the free surface: in some cases they may be at a shallow angle with respect to the free surface, thereby approximating a horizontal orientation. Moreover, offshore platforms typically have horizontal, cylindrically shaped members. The knowledge of this kind of fluid motion has attracted considerable attention from many mechanical and civil engineers working in the offshore field, since the rapid expansion of the offshore industry in the 60s. Fluid motion causes forces to be exerted on structures immersed in them due to vortex shedding. Resonant oscillations caused by these forces may destroy riser pipes of an oil production system in the ocean. Thus, the proposed research studies are of considerable and practical importance in the stability and safety of engineering structures. The intent is to produce useful information about the relationship between physics of fluid motion of this type and the impact (drag and lift forces) of the fluid motion on the cylindrical body. The ultimate objective is, of course, the understanding, prediction, and prevention of vortex- or flow-induced vibrations. The present program of research requires the solution of the well known Navier-Stokes equations using applied mathematical analyzes, numerical simulations and comparisons with experimental observations whenever possible. Comparisons with experiments provides an estimate of the limits of our numerical simulations of very complex flows.

"Thermal treatment is used to preserve the wood without any addition of toxic chemicals. It gives wood an attractive dark color and better dimensional stability. It also decreases the hygroscopicity of wood. Consequently, heat-treated wood has better resistance to biological attacks compared to untreated wood. 

Unfortunately, the dark color of heat-treated wood which is very much in demand for decorative purposes fades with time due to sun exposure (UV radiation). Also, some mechanical properties such as elasticity deteriorate during treatment making the utilization of heat-treated wood unsuitable in structures. These are the two urgent problems of this developing industry. The objective of this study is to find solutions to these problems.

During the study, a coating will be developed for the protection of the heat-treated wood surfaces from UV radiation. Different approaches (utilization of extractives and nanoparticles) will be tested.

A wood composite (glued-laminated timber) will be developed using heat-treated wood. This composite will be suitable for use in structures. Decreased hygroscopicity and wettability of heat-treated wood lead to reduced interaction with the most common wood adhesives that contain polar-groups. Therefore, suitable glues will be determined for this product.

"    )	The proposed reearch program involves four main areas of research,

1) the graph reconstruction problem; 

2) graph embedding algorithms for the torus and other surfaces;  

3) finite projective planes; and 

4) the 3-hypergraph degree sequence problem.  

Algorithms which I have developed usually become part of my software package Groups & Graphs.  This is a software research tool for graphs, digraphs, combinatorial structures, and their automorphism groups. It is used by researchers world-wide.

    )	Item (1) is a major unsolved problem in graph theory. The reconstruction conjecture states that every graph with at least 3 vertices is determined by its subgraphs. To date the solution is unknown. Together with Pierre Ille of the University of Marseille, we have developed some new techniques which seem promising.  Item (2) deals with graphs drawn in the torus and other surfaces.  The torus is often modelled as the surface of a doughnut or inner tube.  The intent is to find an efficient algorithm for finding an embedding of a graph, and to construct a drawing of it.  An example would be drawing an electric circuit on an inner tube.  This is partly solved for the torus, but is not well understood.  Item (3) is concerned with techniques for investigating the existence and enumeration of finite projective planes.  Item (4) is a long outstanding unsolved problem, to characterize the integer sequences that are degree sequences of simple 3-hypergraphs.  There is a strong likelihood that the problem is NP-complete.  If this is the case, this would mean that an efficient algorithm does not exist, which would need to be proved.  This is joint work with Pak-Ching Li of the University of Manitoba.

"Measurement of three-dimensional (3D) geometry is carried out by projecting structured patterns of light onto an object and acquiring 2D images of the deformed light patterns formed on the object surface. The 3D geometry is then reconstructed from these 2D images. We have developed a full-field measurement method to capture the entire 3D surface geometry in view from a single camera and projector position, rather than having to scan across the object. The method permits high resolution 3D imaging by generating a 3D coordinate for every image pixel. We have developed new techniques to achieve a major advantage in requiring only two light patterns to be projected and captured rather than three patterns used previously. Furthermore, the computations are simpler than earlier approaches. Both advantages greatly reduce processing to fully measure a 3D surface. The proposed equipment will enable us to exploit the advantages of our techniques in further developing the technology for numerous applications, such as measuring the shape of large objects, rapidly measuring the changing shape of objects over time while they are deforming, and acquiring 3D video sequences of changing human faces and bodies while they are moving, such as for medical, surveillance, and entertainment applications. Important applications of rapid 3D surface imaging also include part inspection in manufacturing, reverse engineering, modeling for virtual environments, agriculture, archaeology, forensics, and biometrics.","Instrumentation technology","Manufacturing processes and products","Systems Design Engineering","Kofman, Jonathan","EQPEQ ","Computer vision",Robotics,Robotique,1-1

"The ability for humans to make sense of their visual environment depends principally upon two independent parallel interacting brain pathways. These pathways operate such that basic elements of the visual environment are resolved at lower levels and more complex elements at higher levels. Accumulating research has revealed many of the details regarding the anatomy and functioning of these pathways. However, in stark contrast, little is known about how they develop after infancy.

  The present research program will use a variety of psychophysical tests to explore the functional development of the parallel visual pathways in children aged 3 to 12. Children participating in the first set of studies will be followed for the duration of the grant at yearly intervals to provide data on individual differences of the development of visual abilities. The behavioural tests used will permit the evaluation of the two main visual pathways at four levels of complexity across development.

  The significance of the proposed research program is threefold. First, the program will provide a comprehensive understanding of the functional developmental profile of the two main visual pathways. This information will illuminate the relationship between the known maturation of underlying physiological mechanisms and the observed behavioural profiles. It will also assist in our understanding of visual abnormalities in pervasive developmental disorders.

  Undergraduate and graduate students will take part in collecting data for the program of research. These individuals will be exposed to a dynamic and interdisciplinary laboratory environment in which trainees are striving to answer related questions across clinical and non-clinical populations at the molecular, cognitive, and behavioural levels. Trainees will learn to design and program psychophysical experiments, administer these tests to children, conduct analyses, present their work at conferences, and co-author manuscripts for peer-reviewed journals.

  By providing data on the functional development of the visual system, this proposed research program will serve to unify a fragmented literature that has to date only produced a piecemeal account of visual development.

"The application of physics and mathematics to medicine is one of the most rapidly growing areas of interdisciplinary research. Mathematical modeling can provide a quantitative framework to discuss, in detail, the interaction between all components of complex biological systems, as well as to test various therapeutic interventions. The combination of novel computational techniques and mathematical models, grounded in experimental and clinical data, thus provides a powerful new tool in biomedical research. The identification of major factors that influence treatment response in cancerous tumors has been a problem of long-standing interest and relevance to clinical oncology. While conventional cytotoxic treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy have contributed to major advancement in cancer control, there remains significant room for further improvement in many tumor sites. Novel molecularly-targeted treatments, like inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis (the formation of blood vessels from pre-existing vessels), have the potential to complement conventional treatments. There is currently minimal pre-clinical or clinical evidence on which to base decisions about how to optimally combine anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic therapies. Our working hypothesis is that mathematical modeling based on existing and novel biophysical models of the interactions between the vascular, interstitial and cellular compartments of a tumor, and the impact on these interactions on nutrient delivery to cancer cells, can guide the rationale sequencing of anti-angiogenic therapies with existing cytotoxic treatments. The project will revolve around a dynamic process of mathematical model development and refinement, using data derived from histologic and imaging studies in animals, and patient data from ongoing clinical studies in patients with cervix cancer and other tumors.","Medical and health sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Applied Mathematics","Kohandel, Mohammad","CHRPJ ","Biological and Medical Physics",Physics,Physique,3-3
"The application of physics and mathematics to medicine is one of the most rapidly growing areas of interdisciplinary research. Mathematical modeling can provide a quantitative framework to discuss, in detail, the interaction between all components of complex biological systems, as well as to test various therapeutic interventions. The combination of novel computational techniques and mathematical models, grounded in experimental and clinical data, thus provides a powerful new tool in biomedical research. One important application is to modeling tumor growth and its treatment. 

Cancer is an uncontrolled growth of cells that can occur in any tissue of the body. Tumors cannot grow beyond a certain size through simple diffusion of oxygen and other essential nutrients into the tumor. Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is a crucial and observed step, through which a tumor obtains its own blood supply. Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (anti-angiogenic therapy), to complement conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments, could be an effective strategy for the control of cancer, where such combinations would destroy both cancer and endothelial cells. However, with the destruction of the tumor blood vessels, chemotherapies and oxygen cannot effectively reach the tumor cells. Additionally, unlike the vasculature of normal tissues, tumor vessels are structurally and functionally abnormal. A complete understanding of the tumor microenvironment, and the response of a tumor (and its abnormal vasculature) to various treatments, is essential in determining optimal dosage, and in the scheduling and sequencing of combined treatment strategies. Mathematical modeling based on existing and novel biophysical models, as well as pre-clinical and clinical data, would certainly be very useful to study tumor growth and angiogenesis, and the effects of different treatments. The proposal includes the study of tumor growth and various types of cancer treatments, mainly radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and anti-angiogenic therapy. The modeling ranges from the molecular and cellular levels to macroscopic scales.

"Antarctic ice-core records document dramatic changes in atmospheric CO2 over the past 8 glacial cycles (740,000 years). The goal of this research program is to obtain a better understanding of the processes controlling carbon sequestration in the ocean throughout the last full glacial-interglacial cycle by investigating the linkages between dust input, physical oceanography, and marine biology.  The specific research objectives are: (1) to measure changes in surface water stratification (due to ice melt), dust inputs, and carbon export to the seafloor as archived in marine sediments over the last 140,000 years, specifically in the North Pacific Ocean; (2) to develop a global database of paleoceanographic proxies that record biogenic fluxes and ocean characteristics over the past 140,000 years, in order to examine the phasing of physical, chemical, and biological changes as the earth enters a glaciation; and (3) to use a biogeochemistry model in concert with these newly-developed environmental databases to assess the dominant controlling processes (iron flux or stratification) on marine productivity. Sediment analyses and collaborative modeling work will elucidate the different hydrographic and geochemical processes that have affected atmospheric CO2 while the earth was entering into and coming out of the last major glacial period, and how they are expected to affect carbon sequestration and atmospheric CO2 in the face of future climate change.

"This research is focused on the spectral theory of Riemann surfaces, and theory of Hurwitz spaces and Frobenius manifolds.



The main object of our research are compact polyhedral surfaces of an arbitrary genus (the boundary of a polyhedron with several holes may serve as an example). We are  studying  spectral properties of these surfaces and  behavior of the spectrum under deformations. 

   Another direction of our research are extremal problems related to polyhedral surfaces. As a toy example one can mention the following problem:  to find among tetrahedrons of the fixed surface area the one for which the determinant of the Laplacian is maximal; the answer is the platonic tetrahedron and we are going to study further generalizations of this result. 



Another important objective of the research is studying of  behavior of the Bergman tau-function near the boundary of various strata of the Hurwitz space.  

The Hurwitz space is the moduli space of meromorphic functions on compact Riemann surfaces, the Bergman tau-function is a naturally defined holomorphic function on this space. This object plays an important role in several domains of mathematics: theory of isomonodromic deformations, spectral theory, matrix models, theory of Frobenius manifolds. 



  The successful fulfillment of this program will be a significant step ahead in the areas which are currently in the center of research activity in Canada and worldwide.

"The work in Dr. Kolios' laboratory focuses on using novel light and ultrasound technologies to characterize the structure and composition of biomaterials. Of particular interest to him and his group is the application of these technologies to monitor the changes in cells and tissues during cancer therapies. Examples of his work include the use of high frequency ultrasound to monitor cell death and the use of photoacoustics to monitor thermal therapy treatments. In this proposal, one light-based technology, called optical coherence tomography, will be used in a spectroscopic manner to infer changes in the structure of cells during treatment, and compared to the high frequency ultrasound work that is currently underway. Moreover, one ultrasound based technology, acoustic transmission imaging, will be used to look at changes in tissue that occur during ultrasound therapies, in which pathological tissues are eliminated using high intensity ultrasound. The high intensity ultrasound can either heat the tissues to over 60C, or be short enough to causing mechanical tissue disruption without the production of significant heat. We will investigate the utility of the acoustic camera to monitor changes in tissue properties from these treatments. This work will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the strengths and limitations with regards to the clinical use of these technologies.","Physical sciences","Advancement of knowledge",Physics,"Kolios, Michael","RGPIN ","Biological and Medical Physics",Physics,Physique,3-5

"Modern financial instruments designed as contingent claims on equities, currency rates, and other securities have achieved enormous success in global financial markets. They have provided institutional investors with new vehicles to meet their diverse financial needs. The success of these instruments can largely be attributed to mathematical models that have given foundations for their pricing. In the proposed research, I will address some computational and statistical issues related to risk management of such products. In particular, I will consider models that provide more realistic descriptions of different risk factors than the existing ones. They are based on jump and Levy processes, and often are characterized by means of a transformation only. This makes classical methods based on likelihood functions infeasible.    I will focus on the problems of dynamic portfolio selection and   the pricing of American style contracts contingent on several assets. The statistical issues that I will study include estimation and filtering for models involving jump and Levy processes.     



Another area of my research is related to credit risk modeling. Some of the models proposed in the literature require evaluation of the exit time probability. Although there is an abundance of such results in the one-dimensional case, much less is known for vector-valued processes. I would like to study different methods of approximating exit probabilities in multivariate cases, as well as the inverse problem, where for a given exit distribution we try to find the corresponding region.

The students supported by this award will engage in the use of state-of-the-art instruments and techniques for making observations, and will involve with the analysis and interpretation of clouds and precipitation observations and simple models. Such instruments are millimeter-wavelength (3 mm and 8.6 mm, corresponding to frequencies of 94-GHz and 35-GHz) radars and other auxiliary instruments (e.g., microwave radiometers, lidars). 

Our scientific objectives are 1) to improve our understanding on the microphysical and dynamical structure of mixed-phase clouds and 2) to characterize the vertical structure of the small-scale vertical velocity and drop size distributions in stratiform rain and examine the role of melting level dynamics on the final raindrop size distribution observed in stratifrom precipitation. On the long term, the goal is to contribute toward an improvement of the treatment of cloud and their associated processes and feedbacks in large-scale and global climate models. This can reduce the uncertainty regarding the role of clouds and their feedbacks in a changing climate and thus result to better policy making and economic planning at the local and global scale. 

The award will provide stability and continuity in the PI's research laboratory efforts and will enable a smooth transition and mentoring from more-experienced to less-experienced lab members. The PI is also member of the new Earth System Science program at McGill University and thus the award will supports research that will improve our understanding on the atmospheric component of Earth's hydrological cycle. The hydrological cycle is a key interdisciplinary physical process that links all spheres of the Earth system and thus, the students will obtain an Earth system perspective.

"The general area of my research concerns the study of localized patterns in partial differential equations.  Such patterns arise in many different applications such as cellular aggregation, morphogenesis, non-linear laser optics, chemical reactions and flame propagation. Specific examples include animal skin patterns, vegetation patches in deserts, spiral waves in certain chemical reactions, pulses in optical cavities and hot spots in flame propagation problems.



The ongoing program is to elucidate the common underlying mechanisms that initiate and sustain pattern formation. This involves the classification of different types systems and patterns; analysis of transitions from one pattern state to another; identifying pattern locations in space; oscillating patterns; and temporal evolution of patterns.



In the past decade, much progress has been made in studying localized patterns in one spatial dimension. By now, many of the one-dimensional patterns are well understood. On the other hand, two and higher dimensional patterns are more difficult to analyse, often requiring novel approaches. Moreover, two dimensions allow for a much richer collection of patterns, and their classification is an ongoing project.  It is my intention to concentrate on the methods applicable to two and higher dimensional settings.

"What does it mean that a problem has high complexity?  Most often by complexity of a problem we mean its computational complexity, that is, the amount of resources needed by the best algorithm solving the problem. The main problems in complexity theory remain unsolved. The celebrated P vs. NP problem, asking whether every problem with an easily verifiable solution can be solved in short time, is listed by the Clay Institute as one of the seven most important problems in mathematics of the 21st century.  



Complexity theory also deals with other notions of complexity. One of them is the complexity of expressing problems. This is important in database theory; where we want to know which query languages for databases are expressive enough to allow us to ask something non-trivial, and yet computationally are easy enough so that obtaining the answer takes reasonable time. Another notion is the complexity of reasoning. Given a theorem, how complex are the concepts needed to prove it? How long is the shortest possible proof? Can this theorem be proved by an automated proof system? 



This suggests the following question:  if a theorem is expressible with simple concepts, is it easy to prove? In general, even theorems simple to state can have very difficult proofs; Fermat's last theorem is such an example. But is this always the case?  



The goal of my research is to explore various aspects in which complexity arises and the relationships among them, concentrating on machine-independent types of complexity. As a short-term goal, I plan to  study the complexity of describing and reasoning with random-like objects, which are used in proofs of several recent major results in complexity theory.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Advancement of knowledge","Computer Science","Kolokolova, Antonina","RGPIN ","Theory of computation","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",2-5

"In natural language processing, words are often treated as abstract entities divorced from their actual form. However, the actual orthographic or phonetic form of words is an important feature that can be utilized in various tasks. The algorithms that I previously developed for computing word similarity have proven to be effective in a variety of applications, including identification of confusable drug names, and matching person names across different scripts. In the current proposal, I describe how I plan to achieve my two principal research goals: continue developing new measures of similarity, and improve the state-of-the-art in several areas involving sequential processing. With respect to the first goal, my specific objectives are: to propose data-driven learning schemes that integrate many-to-many correspondences and sensitivity to context and to design methods that incorporate linguistic knowledge and require no training data. With respect to the second goal, the areas in which I plan to make an impact are: letter-to-phoneme conversion, machine transliteration, statistical machine translation, and cognate identification. The development and application of word similarity methods leads to a number of challenging research problems, and promises to bring a unifying perspective on several distinct tasks that have so far been perceived as unrelated. Based on the experience of the last few years, I am convinced that this line of research will continue to have an impact beyond the areas of its original application.

"The last decade has seen renewed interest in classical game theory -- a field that studies the behavior of rational self-interested agents in competitive environments. The current focus is on algorithmic aspects of games: Can we find Nash equilibria efficiently in certain games? What is the loss in social welfare (the price of anarchy) if players are allowed to act independently and greedily? Are there incentive mechanisms that force players to behave in a truthful and fair manner?  For many of these questions, ideas from combinatorial optimization and theoretical computer science provide key new insights.  Conversely, Gupta et al. [STOC '03, FOCS '03] showed that game-theoretic cost-sharing ideas can be fruitfully applied to the design and analysis of approximation algorithms for network design problems.  The long-term goal of my research is to further explore the relationship between game theory, theoretical computer science and combinatorial optimization.



I have contributed to this area in joint work with S. Leonardi and G. Schaefer. We studied a game-theoretic variant of the Steiner forest problem, where each player j, out of a set of k players, strives to connect the vertices of her terminal pair (s_j, t_j) in a given undirected, edge-weighted graph G.  We show that a natural adaptation of the primal-dual Steiner forest algorithm of Agrawal, Klein and Ravi [Siam J. of Computing, 1995] and Goemans and Williamson [Siam J. of Computing, 1995] yields a 2-budget balanced and group-strategyproof mechanism for this game.  We also showed that the mechanism-design ideas used in our work give rise to a new linear programming relaxation for the Steiner forest problem which is strictly stronger than the well-known undirected cut relaxation for this problem. As short-term goals, I plan to address the following questions: can we use the new Steiner forest LP relaxation to obtain better Steiner forest approximation algorithms? Can the mechanism design techniques used for the Steiner forest problem be applied to a larger class of network design problems? Can we obtain tighter LP relaxations for these problems?

"The question how and why unfolded proteins can spontaneously fold to their biologically active conformations remains one of the major unsolved problems in biological chemistry. One particularly important bottleneck is the lack of information regarding the very earliest stages of folding. These ultra-rapid processes occur on a sub-millisecond time scale, which makes it exceedingly challenging to characterize the structures of early folding intermediates. Past efforts in this area have largely relied on spectroscopic probes that are unable to supply detailed insights into protein conformations. This proposal describes a novel strategy that will for the first time provide ""snapshots"" of protein structures during the very earliest stages of folding. Ultra-rapid diffusive mixing will expose denatured polypeptide chains to native conditions, thereby triggering the folding process. An excimer laser will then produce OH radicals by photolysis of H2O2, resulting in microsecond covalent labeling of the protein at well defined time points. Importantly, labeling only occurs in solvent-accessible regions, whereas folded segments are protected. Analyses of the labeling pattern by mass spectrometry will then result in highly detailed solvent exposure data which reflect the structural changes during folding. Our group was the first to demonstrate the viability of such an approach in 2009, albeit on relatively slow time scales. Unfortunately, the limited specifications of our existing laser currently preclude the application of this strategy to ultra-rapid folding studies. We therefore propose the acquisition of a new 750 Hz laser that will allow an extension of our work to the sub-millisecond range. This proposal represents a unique opportunity; it will allow our laboratory to pioneer the exploration of ultra-rapid folding events with hitherto unobtainable structural resolution. The resulting insights will enhance the general understanding of biological self-assembly, as well as aberrant side reactions that can lead to disease states. These research activities will provide superb opportunities for HQP training. Failure to secure funding for this equipment would be a severe setback for our research program.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Chemistry,"Konermann, Lars","EQPEQ ","Biophysical chemistry","Physical chemistry","Chimie physique",1-1
"Our research aims to elucidate how proteins fold, how they interact with other molecules, and why certain conditions lead to misfolding and disease. Much of this work relies on the use of electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). ""Time-resolved"" ESI-MS, a technique developed in our laboratory, allows changes in protein compactness during folding to be monitored on a time-scale of milliseconds to seconds. Simultaneously, the overall level of hydrogen bonding, as well as interactions with noncovalent binding partners (such as other proteins) can be probed. One of our goals is to characterize the structure of short-lived folding intermediates at a previously unattainable level, using a variety of strategies. A particularly promising approach is the use of electron capture dissociation for the fragmentation of proteins in the gas phase, following pulsed hydrogen-exchange in solution. By measuring the exchange levels of individual fragments it will become possible to elucidate the temporal order of hydrogen bond formation in a spatially-resolved manner. The use of hydrodynamic focusing will provide dramatic improvements in time resolution down to around one millisecond, such that even very early folding steps can be detected. In parallel, we will employ photochemical methods for the microsecond covalent labeling of proteins. The information obtained in this way (surface exposure of side chains) will be complementary to that obtained from isotope exchange experiments (hydrogen bonding). Ultimately, these activities will allow the development of ""molecular movies"", depicting the complete sequence of conformational changes during folding. In related work, rapid hydrogen exchange will be used to investigate the link between enzyme conformational dynamics and activity. These experiments will provide an answer to the long-standing question if the internal motions of enzymes are enhanced during turnover, or whether catalysis occurs within the limitations given by the intrinsic dynamics of the resting state. Computer simulations will shed light on the exact mechanism by which protein ions are released into the gas phase during ESI. All of these activities will provide excellent opportunities for HQP training.","Physical sciences","Advancement of knowledge",Chemistry,"Konermann, Lars","RGPAS ","Biophysical chemistry","Physical chemistry","Chimie physique",2-3

"A variety of morphological, mineralogical, and geochemical characteristics in ancient sedimentary rocks have been used to decipher the history of life and environment in which it evolved here on Earth, and perhaps on other planets.

Second, I will measure isotope and trace element compositions in experimentally-produced iron minerals and BIF core.

"The general objective of the proposed research is the development of rational engineering approaches for the design of earthworks subjected to environmental stresses, i.e. freezing and thawing, drying and wetting, or a combination of these climatic cycles.  The design engineer needs to address the effect of the environmental stresses for many earth structures such as dams in northerly regions (hydro and mining industries), compacted clay covers to protect waste storage sites, drying and subsequent cracking of clay cores in dams in semi-arid regions.  Moreover, these research areas need also to consider the effect of recent climatic changes such as more extreme conditions and more frequent extreme events.

 

During the new research period, the effects of freezing and thawing as well as drying and wetting cycles on compacted clays, till slopes in embankments or fill cuts and till cores in zoned earth dams will be investigated.  Since there is a physical similitude between freezing and drying as well as thawing and wetting, it is intended to generalize some of the theories that were developed for freezing of soils to the study of the drying phenomenon in soils.  In addition to theoretical and numerical work, laboratory and field studies will be performed to obtain input data for the validation of predictive models.  The field studies will help to develop better air-soil interface models, which in turn, are key input parameters for predicting the response of any structure subjected to these environmental stresses.



The potential benefits of these studies will be found in improved designs of earth dams in permafrost and northerly regions, rational designs of clay covers for permanent closure of mining sites adapted to Canadian conditions, improved specifications for the construction of till embankments.

"The proposed research program addresses fundamental questions regarding code properties and automata (including transducers), and their applications in areas like reliable coding for data communication,  error modeling, spelling correction, and DNA computing. Code properties include synchronization, error detection and correction, as well as properties motivated by reliability issues in DNA computing. Error models are abstract representations of physical channels and can, in many cases, conveniently be described by automata and transducers. This specific application of automata raises new questions about the structure of automata, some of which belong to the core of the theory of these objects. Unlike the classical theory of error correcting codes, which is mainly concerned with block codes, this research focuses on variable-length codes for which little is known with respect to their behaviour in the transmission/storage over noisy channels. My long term goal is to classify and identify meaningful code properties, and to find methods for the construction and quality evaluation of codes with respect to a given set of constraints. My proposed research consists of the following parts.



1. Provide explicit constructions of maximal solid codes. These are codes with remarkably strong synchronization properties.  

2. Study certain abstract theoretical concepts of automata and formal languages that can be used as tools in attempting to answer questions with a specific meaning in more applied areas. 

3. Design efficient algorithms for testing code properties of regular languages and computing maximal error-detecting capabilities of such languages. 

4. Apply the theoretical tools and algorithms in the areas of  DNA computing, error correction, and code design. Moreover, implement the algorithms and make public web interfaces.

"Mass transfer of elements occurs within the earth on a continual basis and where there is sufficient concentration of elements ore deposits or natural resources occur. Elemental transfer occurs in many ways, but magmatic and metamorphic processes are two very significant and widespread ones that have been active through earth history. The study of elemental mobiization on different scales through time and how intra-element associations relate to earth processes is necessary in order to: (1) understand earth evolution, (2) how processes within the earth evolve through time, and (3) how natural resources form and relate to earth evolution. This proposal examines two aspects of mass transfer of elements: (1) the association of different gold deposits and tin, tungsten, molybdenum deposits in a range of environments within a single large geological area (1000s sq. km). This study is then used to examine how such elemental associations relate either independently or collectively to the geological evolution of such regions elsewhere globally; and (2) the processes that are responsible for the mobilization and concentration of tantalum, an element of relevance to societal needs, but also used in understanding earth evolution and important geological processes through time.","Earth sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Earth Sciences","Kontak, Daniel","RGPIN ","Earth science (see also marine geology 4604)","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",2-5

"Inhabiting most of the ocean and fresh waters are members of the Salmonidae family which include the whitefishes and ciscos (subfamily Coregoninae), graylings (subfamily Thymallinae) and trout, salmon and charr (subfamily Salmoninae).   With 25% of the world's coastline and 16% of the world's fresh water in the form of lakes and rivers, Canada's responsibility to these fish and their environment, conservation and potential commercial activities is tremendous.   

     

Scientifically, salmonids have been the subject of over 4,200 scientific publications in the last four years and interests span areas of physiology, toxicology, health, conservation, evolution, and biochemistry.   Salmonids are of special scientific interest because they purportedly underwent a whole genome duplication in their recent past that has doubled all of their genes.  Genome duplication is a reoccuring theme in vertebrate evolution that has played a fundamental role in generating large numbers of species and the complexity seen in modern vertebrates and humans.   The large number of different species of salmonids have taken a variety of strategies to rediploidize (stabilize) their genome. However, recent data from over 400,000 ESTs and several hundred repeated transposon elements suggests that the modern Atlantic salmon genome is far more than can be explained by a single ancestral genome duplication.  Given that the ancestral salmonid genome duplication is assumed in thousands of independent studies and is considered a fundamental tenant in our understanding of salmon and trout genetics, physiology and biology, questions arising from this recent data must be carefully examined.  This study examines a single genome duplication versus a multiple segmental duplication hypothesis and genes and gene regions are examined for loss, dosage effects and possible functional specialization.



     Salmonids are an excellent model system to investigate the consequences of a whole and partial genome duplication and its relationship to bursts of speciation and biological complexity.

Loss of prairie habitats is one of the factors that has resulted in dramatic declines of grassland bird populations over the last four decades.  Learning how to manage prairies and associated agriculture will help us conserve and restore prairies to benefit prairie birds.  At the same time, this research will contribute to our knowledge of how disturbances such as grazing influence prairie birds directly and indirectly.



Because cattle densities are quite low in arid prairies, grazing rarely directly destroys nests. Nonetheless, nesting success is sometimes lower in the presence of cattle. I will determine whether this is because of indirect effects of grazing on vegetation or invertebrate prey of birds. By evaluating the ecological effects of a wide range of grazing intensities, this research will help us manage grazing in prairies to benefit both ranchers and wildlife.



Many prairies are highly fragmented by human activities. Birds may select which prairie remnants to inhabit based on a number of different reasons. For example, their ability to get to prairies, predation pressure within those prairies, and invertebrate prey abundance, may all vary among prairies. All of these factors may be influenced by prairie size, shape, and surroundings. Preliminary surveys indicate that prairie songbirds are rarely found within small prairies, but the reason for this is unknown. I will determine the extent to which prairie size and surrounding agricultural lands influence prairie use by birds, their predators, and their prey.

"Canada is vulnerable to severe wind storms, with significant examples being the Barrie tornado in 1985 (12 lives, $300M), the Edmonton tornado in 1987 (27 lives, $670M), and Hurricane Juan in 2003 (8 lives). The primary safety issue in these storms pertains to keeping the structure on the foundation, and the roof connected to the walls, to minimize both loss of life and economic loss.

It is difficult to measure wind speeds in tornadoes and other thunderstorm winds. While mitigating this damage is what we all want, engineers actually need to know the wind speeds which could happen in order to effectively design buildings or critical infrastructure, such as electrical power transmission systems. Thus, damage surveys are used to observe the damage and infer the wind speeds associated with these storms. Since the wind speeds are not generally known, it is important to calibrate the damage-wind speed relationship. With this in mind, the objective of the project is to obtain controlled, detailed, laboratory-based data for how failures occur using realistic test methods. These data can then be used to develop the engineering models for the damage-wind speed relationship for roof failures, spanning the range of Canadian houses. We will then apply the model to: (i) develop a tool for analysis of roof failures in damage surveys, (ii) assess the wind load provisions in building codes, and (iii) extend this to provide new guidelines for building more resilient houses.

The project will utilize the newly operational, full-scale testing facility, called the 'Three Little Pigs' Project, named after the famous children's story. The research should lead to improved mapping of the wind hazard for use in design in Canada, better warning systems in extreme weather, and, ultimately, to less damage.

At least seven post-doctoral and post-graduate students will be trained during the course of this investigation.","Structural engineering","Construction, urban and rural planning","Civil and Environmental Engineering","Kopp, Gregory","STPGP ","Structural loads and safety","Structural engineering","G�nie des structures",1-3
"Every year severe wind storms cause significant damage to Canadian residential structures and infrastructure. Much of this damage goes undocumented, particularly from an engineering viewpoint, even though such information is important. Detailed knowledge of wind damage is important to determine the performance of building and design codes, to develop of insurance risk or loss models, to improve the ability of meteorologists to forecast extreme events (such as tornadoes and downbursts) and to issue appropriate warnings, and to validate laboratory test results. However, to achieve these goals quantitatively, it is imperative that reasonably accurate estimates of the peak wind speeds are available. This is seldom the case. Thus, the damage observations must be used directly to infer the wind speed. The current proposal addresses this issue, focussing on two particular aspects of storm damage, namely, windthrow  (or uprooting) of trees, and damage caused by, and the flight distances of, windborne debris, and how these can be used to estimate peak wind speeds. To achieve these goals, damage surveys will be conducted with Storm Damage Survey teams from Environment Canada and detailed analysis and experiments will be conducted in the laboratory with full- and reduced-scale models.

   The expected outcomes of the project include an assessment of common failures that are not adequately addressed in the current Canadian building code, the damage costs associated with these failures in the context of insurance risk modelling, and the development of a set of calibrated damage scales that will allow Environment Canada meteorologists to provide improved assessments of the wind speeds in severe storms. The research will involve five principal investigators at two universities as well as providing training for three graduate students and one undergraduate student over a period of three years.

"For scientists, diamond is not just another mineral. Its scientific value stems from the fact that diamond offers the deepest geochemical probe of the earth's interior. The exceptional chemical and physical properties of diamond allow it to store and preserve information about the deep mantle from where it originates. Diamond is also unique in that it occurs only in the most ancient, 2-3 billion year old segments of continents (i.e., cratons). Diamonds and their fluid and mineral inclusions record information about the mineralogy, composition and fluids percolating through the ancient lithospheric mantle. There are only 10 blocks of such stabilization older than 2.5 billion years in the world, and data on each of them provide invaluable insights into ancient geological processes and the formation of continents. The proposed research investigates how diamonds and diamondiferous melts are formed, and uses this information for constraints on the evolution of the proto-continents and their deep roots. Metasomatism is the physicochemical transformation of rocks driven by percolating fluid; metasomatism of the mantle may be a factor in diamond formation. Mantle fluids and gases are also crucial for generation of melts that entrain diamonds. I aim to constrain the nature and role of the metasomatic fluids in, both, diamond-forming processes and in magmatism affecting these proto-continents. The program will study several suites of diamonds, mantle xenoliths and diamondiferous rocks from Canadian and worldwide diamond deposits. Traditional analytical methods will include spectroscopic techniques, electron microanalysis, microscopy and mass-spectrometry. In addition, we will develop an innovative technique that will use X-ray diffraction for identification of micron-size minerals included in diamond hosts. This research will also provide important practical geological information to Canadian companies involved in diamond exploration.","Earth sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Earth and Ocean Sciences","Kopylova, Maya","RGPIN ","Petrology, igneous and metamorphic geology","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",1-5

"With the advent of fast digital computers, numerical simulations are receiving more attention in the design

stage of manufacturing products. Consideration of all factors, which will have an impact on the final product

quality and performance, has become a priority at the design stage of the production. Development of a more

accurate model at the design stage is essential to eliminate the cost and/or penalties that are associated with

determination and application of any required remedies after the product has been manufactured. In high-voltage transformer manufacturing industry, where the unit value of the product can be in the order of millions of dollars and damages add up when the failing unit causes power interruption, an accurate design is more crucial. The goal of this project is to address an existing problem that a local high-voltage transformer manufacturer, CG Power Systems Canada Inc, a world-leading manufacturer of power transformers, is facing. There have been cases where the manufactured unit has not met the standard requirements on transformer tank wall overheating and the presence of hot spots. This problem has been reported in as many as 3 manufactured units over a period of 2 years, causing more than $300,000 of damages. The proposed project is targeted at

developing accurate simulation models that predict transformer tank wall overheating, stray loss, and hot spots

at the design stage. Transformer loss reduction, in large scale, has a significant impact on saving energy and

pollution reduction. This project provides us with the opportunity to establish ongoing research collaboration with CG Power

Systems Canada Inc. This is the long-term objective that is pursued in this project.","Electrical energy","Energy resources","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Kordi, Behzad","EGP   ","Power systems","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",1-1

"Non-structural and semi-structural components make up a significant part of any building, and to a large extent, determine the environmental performance and impact of the structure during its lifecycle.  In recent years, climate change issues have forced regulators to assess the various components of residential and commercial buildings, with a view to reducing the harmful green house gas emissions associated with these components.  The concept of Green Building is now well established and widely supported within Canada. 



Composite materials based on biofibres and biopolymers are environmentally friendly materials that have high specific modulus and strength as well as being recyclable and in some cases compostable.  The multilayered and hollow structure of cellulose fibres also produces good sound and thermal insulation.  Recent advances in the development of novel bio-polymers, foams and more complex structures have made these materials suitable candidates for many interior and exterior building applications. 



The overall objective of this research proposal is to investigate potential methods of introducing green building components for interior and exterior non-structural and semi-structural applications.  The targeted applications will include bio-based wood adhesives, innovative bio-foams for insulation, MDF fibre/polysaccharide composites for engineered flooring panels, and recycled forestry residuals and plastics for roof shingles, as well as innovative layered composite materials for structural applications.

"Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is a precision material removal process that utilizes the heat generated from rapid (~20-100 kHz) spark discharges between the tool and the workpiece that are separated by a small gap filled with a dielectric fluid. A single discharge entails 4 distinct stages: (1) application of a voltage between the tool and the workpiece, (2) dielectric breakdown leading to plasma formation, (3) discharge between the tool and the workpiece leading to the flow of a current resulting in melting and vaporization of both the tool and the workpiece, and (4) implosion of the plasma channel that ejects material off the molten pool, followed by flushing and solidification of the molten particles. The physics involved in the gap phenomena above are rather complex and currently not well understood. In this context, the proposed research program seeks to develop a simple but novel approach to investigate acoustic emission (AE) in EDM.



The research will span the entire spectrum ranging from gaining fundamental insights into EDM through AE investigations, to extending this knowledge towards applied process control. The first phase of this work will entail the development of experimental and analysis tools required to apply acoustic emission as a vehicle to characterize and investigate physical phenomena associated with the various phases of a single discharge. In this phase, single spark experiments will be conducted in a EDM machine tool, as well as in an environmental scanning electron microscope for phenomenological investigations. The second phase follows on this in referring to continuous die-sink and wire EDM processes, with a view to exploiting the knowledge gained in the single spark experiments to develop a framework for the robust application of AE-based process monitoring. It is envisaged that AE application in EDM will not only adequately resolve individual stages of a discharge but also provide process information at a larger scale, especially in terms of spatial discharge mapping, and thereby constitute the link between fundamental process knowledge and practical application.

"The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has diversified into a great many different application areas and approaches, and in order to  clock overall progress and allow some consensus on common tools, the field has established a rigorous evaluation culture through  so-called shared task competitions designed for many state of the art research topics.



However, over the years, these competitions have required required the analysis of larger and larger corpora.  For example, NIST-related collections have systematically increased their size over the years: in 2001, TIPSTER was about 3 MB, in 2002 AQUAINT was about 3GB, in 2006 Blogs-06 was about 150GB.  Today, the Blogs-8 collection which is the new standard collection for the analysis of blogs is about 2.25TB spread across 30 millions documents.  Any research team working on large-scale document analysis must therefore be able to accommodate these huge collections and must move at the terabyte level to keep up-to-date with recent trends.



The CLaC Lab has a strong tradition in participating in shared task competitions and have been successful in various tracks. However, our lab, whose most recent machines are already four years old, work well with gigabyte level document collections, however, it cannot accommodate data collection at the terabyte level,  



The present proposal for equipment is intended to update our laboratory equipment to keep up with the current state of the art in large-scale document analysis.  In order for us to continue to work with standard collections and continue our participation to these benchmark competitions, it has become urgent to update our facilities in order to keep our work at the international level and attract good graduate students.

"If tonight, the president of the U.S. were to resign, only a few minutes later, opinions, beliefs and other comments would already flood the Web. As more and more textual information is available online, it has become necessary to develop natural language tools to help analyze informal texts quickly to make timely decisions. Recent developments in Question Answering (QA) have made it possible for users to ask a question in natural language and receive a specific answer rather than an entire document.  However, to date, most work in QA has been involved in answering fact-based questions from formal and information-rich sources such as newspaper articles.  However, as more and more people use the Web to express their opinions, the problem of answering opinion questions from informal documents will become an important issue.



The objective of this research program is to address the problem of answering opinion related questions from non-factual and informal documents such as online blogs. To achieve this, I plan to take advantage of work done in the area of sentiment tagging and my previous experience in QA.



The detection of opinions and the analysis of blogs is slowly becoming a popular topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and I believe that this program can make a significant contribution to this very young field.  Although most work in NLP is still being performed on formal and factual documents, blogs are very interesting because they provide a ""real"" application scenario and as blogs are created quickly and in mass quantity after an event, the automatic analysis of the content of blogs has become a necessity.

"My area of interest is the theory of Hopf agebras and its connections to noncommutative ring theory and Lie theory. Hopf algebras arise in many areas of mathematics and theoretical physics (knot and braid theory, operator algebras, quantum theory, statistical mechanics - to name a few) and provide a new unified approach to many classical problems in algebra. There have been impressive recent advances in this field.



The focus of the proposed research program will be on actions (or coactions) of Hopf algebras on other algebras (associative, Lie, etc.). In particular, the theory of Hopf algebras gives a unified approach to the study of graded algebras, algebras with automorphisms, and algebras with derivations by viewing them as algebras in the category of (co)modules over an appropriate Hopf algebra. Another promising direction of research in this area is the Lie-theoretical aspects of the theory of Hopf algebras, which have not yet been sufficiently investigated. 



The proposed research deals with classical objects of mathematics such as matrix algebras and finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras and is expected to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in fundamental areas of algebra. It may also find applications in other areas of mathematics and in theoretical physics.

"In each living cell, large and complex machines called ribosomes synthesize all proteins. These protein factories consist themselves of two different biomolecules, namely proteins and RNAs. RNAs are nucleic acids resembling DNA, the genetic material. However in contrast to DNA, RNA can not only store information, but it has also functional roles within the cell similar to proteins. Thus, RNA is the third major biomolecule acting in our cells. The importance of RNA in carrying out crucial biochemical actions has been recognized by several recent Nobel prizes. 

To optimize RNA function within the ribosome, this RNA is highly modified. My proposed research focuses on the molecular mechanism of RNA modification during the early steps of ribosome formation. I will study two systems forming the most abundant RNA modification, pseudouridine. This modification is conserved in all domains of life, but the mechanism by which it occurs is not well understood. Therefore, I am using a simple bacterial model system where a single protein modifies RNA to identify the basic mechanism of pseudouridine formation. Second, I will investigate a more complex, archaeal system where ribonucleoproteins consisting of both RNA and proteins form pseudouridines. These ribonucleoproteins are also involved in the early steps of ribosome biogenesis in humans. Notably, the core protein of these ribonucleoproteins is related to the bacterial protein we are studying, thus allowing us incisive comparisons of the two systems. My aim is to determine the slowest step in the overall reaction using state-of-the-art biophysical techniques. This will be a major accomplishment in determining the mechanism of this important RNA modification. Later, my research will elucidate the chemistry of RNA modification and its specificity within the cell.

The projects on RNA modification proposed here are the first step towards my long-term goal to shed light on the essential cellular process of ribosome formation, one of life's most important enzymes. Knowledge of how the cell builds macromolecular machines is useful to construct artificial nanobiomachines.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Chemistry and Biochemistry","Kothe, Ute","RGPIN ","Nucleic acids",Biochemistry,Biochimie,1-5

"BACKGROUND: The declining fibre supply and rising fibre costs in recent years has forced the panel industry in Canada to seek for non-traditional fibre resource including fibre residues as potential source. Sludge is the final solid waste recovered from the wastewater treatment processes in pulp and paper mills, and the largest by-product of the industry. Millions of tons of dry sludge is generated each year in Canada, but most of the sludge has been disposed of through combustion and landfilling, both of which are today restricted by stricker environmental regulations. While several studies have investigated the use of recycled paper fibres mixed with resin for panel manufacturing , no attempts have been made to use the sludge for BINDERLESS medium density fibreboard manufacture. 

OVERALL OBJECTIVE: This project is to develop novel knowledge and technologies required to manufacture BINDERLESS panels using COMBINED primary and secondary sludge. 

WORK PLAN: The 3 year project will be completed by a team of complementary expertise from leading research institutions in 5 parts: 

1) evaluation of the physical and chemical properties of sludge from various mills and quantification of the effects of pulping processes and raw fibre materials on sludge properties;

2) evaluation of sludge as a filler;

3) biological and chemical modifications of secondary sludge and investigation of its self-bonding mechanism;

4) manufacture of self-bonding fiberboard panels using combined primary and secondary sludge; and

5) development of quality fibreboard panels using less-desirable sludge mixed with virgin fibres and/or resin. 

BENEFITS: the project first and foremost will contribute to the training of HQP. It will generate the comprehensive knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of various sludge materials, and their variation with pulping process and raw fibre material. This study will fill in our knowledge gaps in the self-bonding mechanism and the biological and chemical modifications of secondary sludge, and will develop processing technologies. The acquired novel knowledge and technologies will allow for the first time to manufacture binderless fibreboards using combined primary and secondary sludge.

"Whether in terrestrial wireless applications, satellite communication and broadcasting or radar applications, power amplifiers play an important role in all of these systems. They often account for a large portion of the infrastructure cost and are largely responsible for their power consumption. Consequently, reducing their power consumption and improving their performance is not only economically important but it is also fast becoming environmentally necessary given the vast number of wireless terminals worldwide. One key to power amplifier performance is the transistor technology on which it is built. In recent years, an emerging semi-conductor technology, Gallium Nitride or GaN, has shown excellent promise in helping make power amplifiers better performing and ""greener"" for the environment. As its fabrication has become more and more reliable and its cost has continued to come down, this technology is now poised to be the dominant technology in the wireless/satellite power amplifier market in the coming years. To unlock this potential, power amplifier designers must have access to accurate and robust device models for their CAD tools and must consider novel design approaches to take advantage of the unique features offered by GaN technology. This project aims to develop such models and design approaches to enable Canadian companies to take a lead in using and deploying GaN technology, with all the economic and social/environmental benefits this brings.","Communications equipment","Manufacturing processes and products","G�nie �lectrique","Kouki, Ammar","STPGP ","Microwave and millimeterwave devices, circuits and technologies","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",2-3
"The advent of wireless communications, whether terrestrial or satellite-based, has had profound economic and

social impacts in Canada and throughout the world. Wireless services, (Cell Phones, WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth,

Satellite Communication, Broadcasting, etc.) have become indispensable parts of any country's infrastructure.

However, the accelerated pace of progress in this field has led to the proliferation of services and applications.

This heterogeneous mix of applications, networks and standards is reminiscent of computer networks before

the advent of the Internet. If the Internet experience is any indication, there are substantial gains to be realized

by consolidation and harmonization of the various wireless services. Such developments require, among other

things, a new approach to wireless systems with new enabling technologies. Such approach and enabling tech-

nologies are the subject of intense R&D efforts for future-generation wireless systems. The proposed research

program aims at developing the methodologies, architectures, designs and components that will be suitable

for future generation radio communication and radio navigation systems. The approach will be systemic in

nature but detailed in execution from devices to systems. At the device level, we will work on emerging Gal-

lium Nitride transistors to realize more efficient transmitters. At the circuit level, we will work on developing 

new circuits that can be embedded in analog transceivers to measure their performance. We will also work on 

new miniaturized circuits that duplex transmit and receive frequencies more efficiently. We will further de-

velop frequency-agile circuits that can be used to tune a given transceiver's frequency to the desired service. Put together, these devices/circuits will be used to produce novel transceiver electronics useful for radio communi-

tems, their combined power can be fully exploited by networks and end user applications. This program will serve to train many undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and technicians. When possible, valorization of research results, through patenting, licensing or spin-off companies, will be pursued diligently.

"I solve socially and economically important problems by developing novel models and algorithms. My past research has affected several companies positively, resulted in one patent award with three more filings (all by partner companies), earned me a consulting role with CBS show `Numbers', and won me the 2001 PIMS national outreach award. Future plans include studying climate change through ice core samples, improving the network by detecting threats and bottlenecks optimally, solving targeted advertizing by optimally selecting ads and classifying viewership and securing waters by tracking submarines and pollution. Some mathematical novelties associated with these goals include developing filtering theories that can handle heavy-tailed processes, support robust implementations beyond those already established, estimate signals from mere (partial-differential-equation-defined) traces and observations that are defined in terms of complicated point processes, Markov chains and random environments instead of the usually distorted signal in presence of noise setting. In every application, I work with corporations or individuals dedicated to the area of interest.

   For fundamentally mathematical problems, I will utilize homeomorphic methods Prof. Blount and I just developed with other methods to settle basic probabilistic problems such as existence to martingale problems, tightness, exponential tightness, weak convergence, large deviations and long time behaviour for a large class of stochastic models. Indeed, we have already completed a study on tightness using these homeomorphic methods and the results were amazing: the proofs were shorter while the results were far more general, allowing greater applicability, than the standard results in Ethier and Kurtz (1986) or Jakubowski (1986). In another vein, I will further develop the `look down' particle representation, introduced by Professors Kurtz, Donnelly and Xiong, and investigate its application to stochastic partial differential equations, measure-valued branching processes, population models, controlled Markov process and filtering problems. Notwithstanding Kurtz's 1998 paper, the general particle representation theorem has not been established.

"The proposed research is to evaluate the utility of new weather radar products for hydrological purposes and to improve the understanding of hydrological modelling by developing a comprehensive flow disaggregation scheme in the hydrological model WATFLOOD. 



   Hydrological models are an attempt to model the pathways of water in the natural environment. Much of the activity is underground making it difficult to ensurer that the model faithfully reproduces nature. The model developer makes certain assumptions about the storage and flow paths when writing the mathematical equations to model the flow. An analysis of chemicals in river water can provide information about its origins, flow paths and residence times of river flows. The proposed research will compare computed concentration of chemical tracers in river water from very large watersheds and compare the results to measured values. 



   Hydrological models can not be successfully applied to water resources problems such as flood forecasting, predicting water availability, investigating water quality problems or investigating the impact of human activity or climate change on the hydrological regimes of rivers without good quality meteorological data. Precipitation data is especially important to hydrological modelling. The proposed research will use new weather radar products from the McGill and King City radars. These new products involve extensive corrections to raw radar reflectivities to remove bias and use the Vertical Profile of Reflectivity to estimate the precipitation reaching the ground. In addition, data from the experimental high resolution radars operated by Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) will be evaluated. The WATFLOOD hydrological model will the focus of the modelling research and will also be used for the radar data evaluation.

"Mangroves are considered one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, serving both terrestrial and marine food webs as well as acting, for marginalized peoples of tropical coasts, as an essential local renewable resource and barrier against tsunamis, sea-level rise and storm surges.  However, these forested wetlands are experiencing annual rates of loss that exceed that of terrestrial tropical rainforests.  One main limitation to their protection is the inability to receive updated information regarding the extent and condition of many of these forests.  Consequently, a focus of my proposed research is to assess whether new space-borne sensors, including Canada's Radatsat-2, can be used to extract vital biophysical parameter data (e.g. tree height, tree density, biomass) from these stands.  Able to image at night and through clouds, these radar satellite are now equipped with sensors that could possibly, for the first time, allow highly accurate mapping of mangroves in quasi-permanent cloud covered regions.  One of the major causes of mangrove loss is upland water diversion projects (e.g. dams).  Consequently, I also intend to model relationships between changing hydrological data for two of the world's largest rivers and their mangrove forests using historical in situ and satellite data.  

  Recent studies on the use of mangrove forests by local inhabitants indicate that these people depend on mangrove timber for a variety of uses.  The results of these studies also indicate that factors such as species composition, stem size and distance from settlements could explain the extent of harvesting occurring for select parts of these forests.  I propose to develop a unique spatial database to identify and predict areas for local mangrove harvesting.  This tool will be based on the integration of various sources of data including information derived from satellites and knowledge gathered from local fishermen.  Finally, I intend to assess the potential use of dendrochronology (i.e. tree ring dating) for identifying specific historical causes of mangrove forest degradation.  In particular, I anticipate that changes in tree ring characteristics will reflect past perturbations and thus assist researchers in identifying key causes of mangrove loss.

"The importance of the success of plant biotechnology for Canada was recently reflected by the fact that the only two main strategic research themes that were proposed by Genome Canada were both on plant bioproducts/ plant health. The ability to deliver on both of these themes will largely depend on the availability of effective protocols for transformation of crops. The proprietary technology that we are developing substantially increases the efficiency of transformation in plants. The major problem in generating transgenic plants is the random, non-precise integration of frequently truncated multiple copies of genes. The process of generating transgenic plants is thus tedious, expensive and does not allow adequate control over gene expression. Our technology will make the introduction of genes more efficient and will allow integration of multiple intact transgenes. The use of plants such as triticale, canola, tobacco etc., as factories for protein production (growth hormones,

insulin, antibodies, vaccines) and biopolymers, requires fast and precise transformation techniques. A main focus of our group is to establish protocols for transformation of plants used for the production of new bioproducts. The project will expand scientific knowledge of plant transformation, homologous recombination-mediated mechanisms of DNA integration and methods of DNA delivery in triticale.Applications of these technologies include 1) analysis of gene function/gene regulation; 2) regulation of metabolic pathways for industrial end-use, e.g. starch, cellulose, lignin, native proteins; 3) industrial farming by

stacking bioproducts, e.g. industrial oilseed crops, medicinal plants; 4) generation of crops with superior qualities, including disease and stress resistance; and 5) improvement of biosafety of GM crops. The project will establish a leadership position in the new bio-industry for renewable bio-materials, especially in triticale initiative within the next decade. The fact that PIs involved in this project have in past 5 years received over 5 millions in operating and equipment funds and have established themselves as prolific researches and effective mentors will ensure the program success.","Agriculture and primary food production","Agriculture and primary food production","Biological Sciences","Kovalchuk, Igor","STPGP ","Plant and treebiology","Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",2-3

"Historically, the biological effects of low-dose radiation were estimated by extrapolating from the biological effects of high-dose radiation on Japanese atomic-bomb survivors, groups of exposed uranium miners, radium painters, or nuclear submarine builders. This extrapolation postulates that any dose no matter how small is potentially harmful. However, it was recently shown that the biological effects of low-dose radiation are considerably more complex. Living organisms have great capacity to 'withstand' or 'adapt' to radiation. Adaptive response is defined as the acquired radio-resistance after irradiation with low doses. In my NSERC funded project we have shown that plants can adapt to chronic irradiation and life in Chernobyl area by substantially re-shaping their genomes.  

The phenomenon of radioadaptation of mammalian species has not been sufficiently explored. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian adaptation to low dose radiation are the focus of my NSERC renewal. 

In collaboration with the researchers of the Chernobyl Scientific Center we will address the molecular and cellular changes in the laboratory mice subjected to low dose radiation exposure.  

The following questions will be addressed:

What is the molecular nature of low dose radiation-induced effects in the cell?

Does adaptive response induced by radiation exposure of mammalian cells exist and what are the mechanisms triggering it?

Which roles do epigenetic changes (DNA methylation, histone modifications, miRNAome changes) play in radiation adaptation? 

This project should result in a solid understanding of basic radioadaptive processes, cellular physiology, genotoxic stress responses and molecular evolution.

"Heterogeneous inegration of nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) for mass-production requires self-assembly techniques working at nanoscale. The recently proposed DNA-assisted micro-assembly is capable of rapid parallel assembly of different kinds of components on an appropriately designed substrate. However, it requires a number of improvements and rational design in order to become suitable for heterogeneous integration of nanosize components at the industrial level. In particular, crucial are questions of reducing non-selective binding, control over attachment strength and precise alignment of the attached components. Rational design in silico can tremendously facilitate selection of a solvent composition to optimize the stages of attachment and alignment, external conditions affecting the process, and finally, tunable supramolecular (bio)organic ""glue"" best suited for the process. This project will involve predictive molecular modeling for rational design of the nanoscale heterogeneous integration: (i) three-dimensional molecular theory of solvation (aka 3D-RISM-KH), capable of predicting both solvation structure and thermodynamics and conformational stability of a variety of supramolecules and biomolecules in solution, including effects of thermodynamic conditions, co-solvent, buffer, and pH; (ii) Molecular Dynamics and Langevin Dynamics simulations for supramolecular conformations, coupled with 3D-RISM-KH accounting for the solvent effects; and (iii) theory f kinetics of supramolecular attachmment in solution, based on Marcus type approach, using the free energy along the attachment pathways produced by MD, LD, and 3D-RISM-KH.   Deliverables:

1) Unique molecular modeling tool for prediction of the solvation structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics of programmed self-assembly and spatial adjustment of supramolecular linkers in solution;

2) Rational design of tunable supramolecular linkers, solution composition and temperature protocols for a new technological process of nanoscale heterogeneous integration in solution;

3) HQP (2 PhD graduates) proficient in theoretical modeling of heterogeneous integration at nanoscale.

"Mechanical systems that interact with environments via physical or virtual contacts are important elements in many applications. Examples include ground and space based robotic systems, force feedback/haptics devices, and human/machine interfaces. The contact interaction (real or virtual) may be uncontrolled or controlled. Investigations have so far mainly been concerned with the case where the mechanical system is already given, designed independently, and the task is to analyze or control the interaction and the associated contacts.



In this proposed work we will develop another framework, where the interaction and the associated performance requirements are fundamental elements to the mechanical system design. The mechanical system is designed to provide optimum performance for the required contact interactions. To achieve this goal, the underpinning element will be an analysis toolbox for the unified design, controller analysis and operations of interacting mechanical systems. This will include algorithms for dynamics and control system analysis. The developed framework will also greatly facilitate the operations and control of existing systems. We also intend to perform experiments to demonstrate the contributions of the work. We will combine mechanism and control system analysis and design to achieve stable, high-performance devices for real and virtual contacts. We envision the development of ``intelligent"" mechanism concepts, which will maximize the control system performance and exploits the natural mechanical dynamics of the system to achieve desired performance requirements. This can subsequently lead to simplified control systems as well.

We will illustrate the results of the work particularly for two main groups of applications: haptics mechanisms intended for use in virtual or teleoperated environments, and space systems designed for direct contact interactions.","Electrical and electronic machinery and equipment (including computer hardware)","Manufacturing processes and products","Mechanical Engineering","Kovecses, Jozsef","CRDPJ ",Dynamics,"Mechanical engineering","G�nie m�canique",2-3
"Mobile robotic systems play an increasingly important role in many areas such as production systems, terrestrial and planetary exploration, and personal robotics. This project aims at the development of a mobile-robotics software platform with a particular focus on design for and operations on unstructured environments. A simulation environment that will be capable of online and off-line applications is planned. We will develop a comprehensive dynamics-modelling framework capable of addressing mobile robotics development tasks in both structured and unstructured environments. A key point will be the detailed characterization of vehicle/terrain interactions and their incorporation in the modelling environment. We will go further than a standard simulation environment normally does. Analysis tools and algorithms will also be established and implemented to validate and characterize operations and designs of mobile robots. The proposed research will produce methods to evaluate energy expenditure, mobility, and measures that characterize the performance of a mobile platform during operation. These will be implemented as embedded modules that can send signals to the user on the validity of manoeuvres and the satisfaction of performance specifications. We will also implement algorithms, e.g. for suspension reconfiguration planning, which will allow the user to perform a detailed evaluation and synthesis of mechanical designs for mobile platforms. An important issue we intend to address is the modelling and simulation of off-road operations of mobile robots related to in-situ resource utilization, such as excavation and drilling. We will investigate both detailed off-line models and simplified online representations. 

The project is structured into three major work packages. The execution of the work will strongly rely on a group of graduate students. We expect that the results of the work will produce important research findings that will be of significant benefit to industrial and government organizations and also to the Canadian society at large.

"This research program addresses the development and applications of a novel framework for dynamics modelling, analysis, control, and design of mechanical systems. This framework will expand the current boundaries of analytical mechanics and will establish methods to the solution of a number of problems in the areas of multibody systems, robotics, haptics, virtual environments, and biomechanical systems. The work will generate significant new theoretical and practical knowledge, thereby advancing the state of the art. It will also result in modelling, analysis, simulation, and control techniques and algorithms. A particular analytical contribution is the systematic unified consideration of complex finite degree of freedom mechanical systems with a broad range of constraint conditions. These conditions include nonideal constraints, imperfect constraints, aspects of unilaterally constrained motion, impulsive motion, as well as classical ideal bilateral constraints. Novel forms of dynamics and statics representations will also emerge in this framework. We intend to develop the fundamentals to offer a deeper understanding of the behaviour of autonomous mobile systems for unstructured environments. This can lead to the development of more efficient systems. The methods proposed will also offer insight into biological locomotion and will contribute to the control and design of artificial legged systems. Using the proposed analytical framework, we will also study some fundamental problems of biomechanical dynamics and robotics, which are related to redundant actuation and constraints. High-fidelity haptic rendering, to provide the physical feeling of touch for the interaction with virtual or teleoperated environments, poses several challenges. Based on the analytical framework, we propose an approach that will hold the promise to solve several of these problems, and facilitate the development of advanced haptic multibody mechanisms and simulations, control algorithms, and design. Research training of highly qualified personnel will be an important element of the work. The anticipated results of this research program will be of significant benefit to industry and society at large.

"When any physical substance is heated to high temperature, its constituents experience a series of dramatic changes. At sufficiently high temperatures, not only atoms, but even protons and neutrons break apart, forming a new state of matter, the quark-gluon plasma. The required temperature to produce this ""hot quark soup"" is quite high, and was only available in the early Universe during the first microsecond after the Big Bang. Recently, however, it became possible to produce quark-gluon plasma in the ""little bang"" experiments  at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in the Brookhaven National Lab. Experiments to study quark-gluon plasma are planned at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in the near future. For a theorist, the quark-gluon plasma is a challenging subject whose study involves a rich interplay between quantum field theory, plasma physics, statistical mechanics, and (recently) string theory. There is significant evidence that quark-gluon plasma is not even a plasma, but rather a quantum liquid. This proposal focuses on string theory methods to understand the quark-gluon plasma and other strongly interacting quantum liquids through the use of gauge-gravity duality (also known as AdS/CFT correspondence). The whole research program is new, and up to now has produced interesting results on such diverse subjects as viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma, energy loss by energetic quarks, and even charge transport in high-temperature superconductors. The AdS/CFT calculations are currently influencing the interpretation of RHIC data; within few years, one is looking at the ""applied string theory"" at the LHC.

"The compounds made by students and researchers in my group will be used as initiators or catalysts for making new polymeric materials (plastics) from renewable starting materials (feedstocks). Most modern plastics are made from petrochemical sources, which are quickly becoming depleted or prohibitively expensive. Our research seeks ways to improve our use of these resources in a more energy efficient and higher yielding manner. We are also using alternative starting materials that can be obtained cheaply from renewable materials, such as plants, or from waste products, such as carbon dioxide (CO2). In short, can we make new plastics from chemicals obtained from plants, as well as use at least some of the CO2 that is accumulating in our atmosphere? 

  The problem with many of these starting materials, especially CO2, is that they are very unreactive and require forcing conditions (such as long reaction times, very high temperatures or pressures) in order for us to do chemistry with them. The use of metal-containing catalysts is one way to make the processes using these feedstocks more rapid and energy efficient. Since these catalysts must be very reactive, they must be handled under special conditions free from oxygen and water, which could destroy the catalyst.

  This proposal will develop a sound program of fundamental research with important potential applications. We will obtain new insights and develop expertise into the important area of biodegradable polymer synthesis using renewable sources. Combining petrochemical and bio-sourced feedstocks will yield new, high performance polymeric materials of interest to companies in the polymer industry. This work will undoubtedly lead to collaborations with industry, as well as with academics in the related fields of materials physics and engineering, for commercialization of new technologies. The biodegradable/bioassimilable nature of these materials will lead to collaborations with the biotechnology sector to assess their use in medicine or their degradation pathways.

"One of the broad goals of statistical mechanics is to understand the behaviour of a physical system at criticality; that is, at (or near) the temperature at which a phase transition occurs.  A well-known example of a phase transition occurs when water freezes (i.e., it changes state from liquid to solid) or when it boils (i.e., it changes state from solid to gas). In more elaborate models, the continuous physical system is well-described by a discrete, or lattice, model. These lattice models are often more tractable mathematically, and often physical or chemical predictions about the continuous system can be proved rigorously using results established for the lattice model. An important class of systems are two-dimensional; by first understanding two-dimensional models, we may better hope to understand our three-dimensional world. An exciting development occurred in 2000 when Oded Schramm introduced the stochastic Loewner evolution (SLE) while studying scaling limits of loop-erased random walk.  SLE is a new class of conformally invariant stochastic processes which has revolutionized the study of critical phenomenon in statistical mechanics.  In fact, its importance was punctuated by the awarding of the Fields Medal to Wendelin Werner ""for his contributions to the development of stochastic Loewner evolution, the geometry of two-dimensional Brownian motion, and conformal field theory.'' Although this program of study has already produced several deeply significant results, there is still much more work to be done. For instance, the self-avoiding random walk, a model of polymer chains introduced by the Nobel prize-winning chemist Paul Flory in the 1940's, is a model where minimal mathematical progress has been made and is one of the motivations for much of this entire program of study. Another important area of study that has not yet received much attention is the case of multiple interfaces that occur naturally in, for example, ferromagnetism and the corresponding Ising model. Therefore, the primary goal of this research program is to study multiple SLE curves and their interactions which is the natural continuous object to study when considering multiple interfaces.

"The major focus of this research program is to provide objective information on trunk muscle activity and trunk motion that can be used to help develop injury prevention, rehabilitation and treatment programs for low back injury/pain.  The huge economic burden associated with low back injuries, many of which occur in occupational settings, requires attention given its impact on the individual and society.  Many problems with the low back that are not related to a specific disease or injury to a physical structure such as the disc are related to changes in the muscle function.  Thus understanding how the muscles work together to perform a task or to protect the spine is important to a number of areas.  First in many occupations anatomical structures in the low back can be injured and altering the design of tasks relies on good ergonomic assessments which in many instances means we have to know what stresses are placed on the muscles and how could this be altered to reduce the risk of low back injuries.  Secondly in the clinical setting if the muscles are affected by low back pain we need to be able to accurately detect those changes and monitor those changes using good diagnostic and monitoring techniques.  Thirdly this information can then be used to improve the design of rehabilitation and treatment programs.  My research program attempts to understand the relationship amongst muscles of the back and abdomen while people perform different tasks.  We know that the muscles have altered patterns of activity in those that have low back pain, but what are the factors that alter these patterns.  The proposed work will begin to determine how these are patterns are altered by looking at a number of different factors including when the task is changed, when the person is fatigued, and when the person has a low back injury.  We record electrical activity patterns from a large number of muscles as well as measure how the back moves.  We have a novel approach that allows us to study all of the relationships among the various muscles and it has increased our understanding of how the muscles work together.  The long term goal is to reduce low back injuries both recurrent and new.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","Biomedical Engineering, School of","Kozey, Cheryl","RGPIN ",Biomechanics,"Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",1-5
"Measurement of human anthropometry and mathematical modeling of 3-D reach surfaces for applications for workspace and protective clothing design.



An optimum match between the human capabilities and the task requirements will permit the development and operation of safe, productive human-machine-environment systems.

At the present time the author is further developing a research program focused on the measurement and modelling of human anthropometry which will combine and compare the areas human reach capabilities for able-bodied and wheelchair mobile populations for a variety of applications. This research has a variety of applications including various settings and impacts a variety of user groups (children, adults, elderly and disability related).

"The proposed study focuses on understanding the properties of supercritical water (SCW) containing solid corrosion or wear products, a detailed characterization of the particulates and their fluidic properties, and the development of high-pressure-temperature separation technologies for the removal of solids.  While current CANDU designs have an indirect cycle, i.e., a separate primary heat transport system in contact with the fuel coupled (via steam generators) to the secondary side for steam production to drive turbines, the CANDU SCWR is likely to be a direct cycle plant, i.e., the same fluid that contacts the fuel will also drive the turbines. In a boiling water reactor (BWR), ionic impurities, precipitated solids, wear debris and radioactive corrosion products in heat transport systems are largely retained in the liquid phase of a two-phase vapor-water system. Those species are considered hazardous to system materials and heat transfer and radiation safety, and are controlled/removed by comprehensive chemistry control protocols.  

The proposed GEN IV SCWR maintains a single phase of SCW (instead of vapor and water phases) throughout the entire reactor circuit.  SCW possesses a lower density, ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 g per cubic centimeter, and non-polar characteristics, thus presenting a chemistry paradigm different from liquid water currently used in nuclear power systems.  If solids precipitated from SCW are not removed properly, they can transport, deposit and form fixed layers on the surface materials of a nuclear system. If they deposit on fuel cladding surfaces, this will affect the heat transfer and lead to fuel failures and increase radiation fields around the reactor circuit.  It will be crucial that an SCWR has a purification system capable of removing impurities including ultrafine solids.  

The proposed project would address one of the technology gaps identified in the GEN IV program.  It is also expected to find applications in other clean-energy areas such as SCW coal gasification and bio-fuel production.","Nuclear energy","Energy resources","Chemical Engineering","Kozinski, Janusz","NNAPJ ","Nuclear engineering","Nuclear engineering","G�nie nucl�aire",2-3
"There is an increased global awareness and development toward establishing sustainable energy systems including bioenergy and a hydrogen economy.  The hydrogen/bioenergy-based economy intends to replace the current fossil fuels-based energy systems with H2-based and biofuel-based systems.  Hydrogen would be the carrier of energy from other resources such as hydropower, wind, solar and biomass.  These resources are sustainable and they don't contribute to GHG in the atmosphere.  The hydrogen economy will be a linked network of processes that produce hydrogen through fossil fuel reforming, biomass conversion, and electrolytic splitting of water.  Hydrogen could be stored and used to generate electricity through fuel cells.  However, the hydrogen economy suffers from several barriers.  One of the major barriers is efficient hydrogen production.  The development of cost-effective technologies to produce hydrogen requires intensive effort in both basic research and engineering.  A similar approach concerns generation of biofuels from available biomass feedstock.  This project proposes a new technology in which biomass, as a renewable energy source, is converted to hydrogen via gasification and to bio-oil via pyrolysis.  These processes will be carried out in supercritical water (SCW), thus improving significantly the energy balance by eliminating the need for drying of biomass.  The project's most important contribution to training of highly qualified personnel is its multidisciplinary nature.","Alternative energy resources","Energy resources","Chemical Engineering","Kozinski, Janusz","STPGP ","Other sources of energy (solar, wind, etc.)","Fuel and energy technology","Combustibles et technologie de l'�nergie",2-3
"Chemical and biological agents have been viewed as a preferred means to generate terror because of their ease and low cost of production or acquisition. The criminal terrorist attacks on USA, in 2001, on the World Trade Center followed by the anthrax mailings emphasized the vulnerability of individuals in buildings. Building targets can encompass not just government or military structures but also high profile commercial, healthcare institutions, as well structures with high density of people such as shopping malls. In addition to terrorist events unintentional chemical spills or certain infectious agents can impact individuals in buildings as well. The major route for dissemination of chemical or biological agents within a building is the HVAC system. Common to different threat scenarios direct instillation of these agents at the air intake site, dispersal in the environment (or atmosphere) followed by entry through the same air intake

site or a spill within the building itself is the capacity of the HVAC system to disseminate the agents to all inhabitants of the structure.

Our proposal will set the foundation in the development of an immune building to chemical or biological agents. In order to minimize, if not eliminate, the impact of the disseminating a chemical agent via the HVAC system we propose to study the operational characteristics of an Early Warning And Response (eWAR) approach. The eWAR is intended to detect, identify and initiate a response to chemical and biological agents. The proposed studies will be undertaken within a model that will permit a better understanding of the effects of varying conditions on agent dispersal in the HVAC system, optimize detection strategies and assess different responses. The work done in a model will be followed by additional studies on an actual building. This work is essential to developing realistic strategies for the protection of life in existing structures as well as planning for new construction.

"There is an increased global awareness and development toward establishing sustainable energy systems based on bioenergy. The bioenergy-based economy seems most suitable to complement the current fossil fuel-based energy systems prior to introduction of the hydrogen economy in the future. 

This research program proposes a comprehensive approach in which biomass residues, as a renewable energy source, are converted to syngas via gasification and to bio-oil via pyrolysis. These processes will be carried out in supercritical water (SCW), thus improving significantly the energy balance by eliminating the need for drying. Water at high temperatures and high pressures (supercritical conditions; ~374oC and 22.1 MPa) has unique properties, which are different from those of steam or liquid water. SCW behaves like a non-polar organic solvent completely dissolving organics and gases. We are interested in waste biomass because it is simply clean stored solar energy. It is not only a plentiful fuel, but its use also reestablishes the natural carbon cycle. If the harvesting and use of the biomass as a fuel make land available for re-growth, this renewable energy source is nearly CO2 neutral. In the case when biomass is used as a source of syngas (H2/CO), which is proposed here, there is a net reduction in total CO2 amount because CO2 is absorbed during biomass growth while only a portion of this amount is emitted during biomass-to-H2/CO conversion. 



The project's most important contribution to training of highly qualified personnel is its multidisciplinary nature.

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging is one of the most versatile imaging techniques for studying fundamental properties of tissue. Its intrinsically non-invasive character makes it particularly suitable to study human and animal biology. Although it can generate images with very high spatial resolution, its sensitivity is somewhat limited. Positron Emission Tomography is an imaging technique that uses specially designed radiotracers to study specific biological processes at a molecular level. Unlike MRI, PET imaging is very sensitive; however it suffers from limited spatial resolution. Since MRI and PET provide often complementary information, carrying out combined MRI/PET studies on the same animal will provide research capability that is significantly improved over the means of each technique alone. Long term objective of the proposed research programme is to develop quantitative MRI and PET techniques and experimental setup for the combined MRI/PET technology for biological applications.

Short term objectives of the proposed research are:

1. To develop experimental setup for nearly simultaneous MRI/PET studies in the same animal.

2. To develop quantitative T2 MRI techniques to study physical properties of water in animal Central Nervous System.

3. To develop and implement quantitative MRI techniques for blood flow measurements in vivo.

The proposed programme aims to expand research capabilities in the area of non-invasive studies of many aspects of animal physiology. Quantitative, multi-modal non-invasive imaging technology developed throughout this programme will help to broaden our understanding of biology of normal and diseased tissue. In addition this programme will provide excellent opportunities for training graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in an interdisciplinary environment.","Medical and health sciences","Advancement of knowledge",Radiology,"Kozlowski, Piotr","RGPIN ","Life sciences research related to human health and disease","Life sciences research related to human health and disease","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines",3-5

"Kinases are enzymes that are involved in regulating key cell functions. The reaction catalyzed by kinases is the transfer of a phosphate group from adenosine triphosphate to a hydroxy amino acid. Their activity is carefully controlled and uncontrolled activation of these enzymes has been linked to various forms of cancer. In our proposal, we make use of this fundamental reaction and propose a method for the rapid monitoring and profiling the kinase activity in cell and tissue extracts using. This screening method exploits our recent discovery of the protein kinase catalyzed transfer of a redox label from a novel redox-active analogue of adenosine triphosphate. This approach will enable the quantification of the kinase activity by electrochemical methods. In our approach, we make use of an electrochemical peptide array that has individually addressable gold pads, each having a peptide specific for a particular protein kinase, allowing us to monitor the activity of

several kinases simultaneously. We will focus on protein kinases linked to breast cancer and develop an electrochemical microchip able to probe the activity of four key protein kinases. This electrochemical approach is at the cutting edge and has the potential to supersede existing technologies, and will undoubtedly find widespread application in cancer diagnostics and in monitoring patient responses to therapy. We foresee applications in the field of drug development through its amenability for automated high throughput screening of potential kinase inhibitor candidates. Given the role of protein kinases in tumorigenesis and their emergence as the largest potential family of �druggable� enzymes, this research is expected to have a direct impact on cancer diagnosis and treatment.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services",Chemistry,"Kraatz, HeinzBernhard","STPGP ","Bioanalytical chemistry","Analytical chemistry","Chimie analytique",2-3
"Scientific names provide the basic vocabulary and information framework for biodiversity, though their application is difficult when dealing with larval, immature or otherwise fragmentary biological remains. This is not trivial in light of climate change and the increasing globalization of trade, as economic development leads to higher extinction rates and the introduction of invasive and pest species. As a result, local, national and international communities are demanding more and faster species identification services than ever before. A Canadian scientific innovation known as DNA barcoding uses a 648 base-pair sequence at the 5' end of the mitochondria! cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene as a standard for animal identification. This gene target is flanked by highly conserved regions that permit the construction of ""universal"" PCR primers needed to facilitate broad taxonomic application of the method. However, in some cases, researchers have encountered taxon specific patterns of universal primer failure that complicates the construction of the reference sequence library. This is problematic because a comprehensive DNA sequence library is essential for identification with DNA barcodes.

In this proposal, we are developing a method for high throughput screening of the CO1 primer regions, which is critical for the success of the international barcode project.

"Animals rely on their sense organs to collect information on their environment. The brain then needs to extract information that is relevant for behavioural decisions. This involves, for example, the segregation of objects from their background as well as the determination of important object features such as size, distance, or speed of movement. The successful performance in these tasks enables animals to forage, to escape predators, and to communicate. If we are to understand the mechanisms by which the brain solves these problems, we first need to understand what the relevant sensory stimuli are that a given organism needs to extract and then we can ask the appropriate questions about how the nervous system accomplishes this task.  Weakly electric fish have become a prime model system in which to study how the brain processes sensory information, because the sensory stimuli (electric fields) are easy to measure and reproduce in an experimental setting and because the electrosensory system is accessible for neurophysiological experimentation. Electric fish probe their environment with self-generated electric fields and sense perturbations of the electric field with electroreceptors in their skin. My goal is to compare how different types of electric fish that use different probing strategies (discrete pulses versus continuous sampling) process the categorically different incoming sensory information. The neural circuits used for sampling information on the environment are virtually identical in the two groups, yet they have to contend with very different stimuli. The results of this investigation will shed light on how sensory systems evolve to process novel types of information caused by a change in interaction with the environment.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Biology,"Krahe, R�diger","RGPIN ",Neurophysiology,"Animal biology","Biologie animale",1-5

"My research is concerned with habitat selection, movement and antipredator behaviour and how they affect the distribution of animals. My team studies these subjects in coral reef fishes, mongooses, chipmunks, squirrels, and other members of the squirrel family.

     During the next two years, before I retire, we will complete a study of how reducing the number of fish in an area increases the movement of fishes from other locations into the area, and how these movements are affected by habitat quality and connections to larger areas. This study will help us to understand how marine reserves protect fish populations and how they can be used to improve adjacent fisheries. Using data collected during damselfish removal experiments, we will also examine how the abundance of damselfishes, a very aggressive and territorial fish, influence species that compete for their algal food. Additional studies will examine why juvenile damselfish are brightly coloured in contrast to the dull black colour of adults. 

     We will also complete a study concerning how the behaviour of mongooses influences predation on the nests of endangered sea turtles. We are interested in factors such as the amount of vegetation (cover for mongooses) and the amount of disturbance (decreases use of open areas) influence predation on nests laid in different habitats. This study will be followed up by a comparison of predation risk of turtle nests on different beaches in relation to amount of cover, human disturbance, density of mongooses, and other variables. These studies will allow conservationists to focus efforts on the locations where they are most needed and possibly to change predation risk by changes in habitat. 

     I will study how vigilance behaviour (the way that animals watch for predators) is adjusted to different habitats using both theoretical models and videorecordings obtained during a survey of vigilance behaviour in many western North American species from the squirrel family. We will also complete a study of vigilance in mongooses that complements the studies of their predatory behaviour and habitat selection.

"This proposal focuses on the construction of a decision support sustyem related to Great Lakes management, applicable to the Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA) and the Canada-Ontario Agreement Respecting the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem. This proposal entail a detailed analysis of current and emerging science and technology in the Great Lakes region and internationally, to be modeled into a decision support system that can updated long term commitments to improve the Great Lakes environment, economy, and quality of life.  This program will include detailed research on heretofore-intractable scientific priorities. This research will examine whether the current Agreement can address the new and emerging science, engineering and governance challenges, as well as what direction a revised Agreement or other instrument could take to most substantively benefit Canada.  This proposal is at the interface of science and policy to understand and advance solutions to Great Lakes societal, environmental, industrial, scientific and engineering problems. We will develop systematic, basin-wide models based on existing data, expert opinion, and fuzzy logic.  This will then enable the construction of (a) decision support system(s) that will assist in deriving the dominant drivers that would move the Basin back to as state of ecosystem integrity.  These stressors will include, for example, emerging chemicals and health effects of concern, and new initiatives and advances in watershed-based approaches to land use management.  Findings will accelerate responses to of re-emerging environmental stressors based on risk assessment models, decision analysis and adaptive management theory and practice.

"The broad goal of this work is to develop new systems and networking techniques to support time-sensitive distributed applications, using a best-effort commodity infrastructure. The research objectives of this work are related by a general theme of quality adaptation, the motivation of which is to address the conflict between time-sensitive applications and the best effort service model that still remains the sole option available to the vast majority of Internet users. We also aim to explore how to apply principles of context-aware computing to enhance the process of user and community oriented video production and distribution.



The general idea of quality adaptation is to structure systems so that they can dynamically adapt the quality of their results, in such a way as to attain the basic timing requirements of the application, using the resources that happen to be available (network bandwidth, processor cycles, storage space, display area, etc.). This approach is motivated to address two fundamental obstactles to predictable timing: device diversity and dynamic sharing of resources. In the long term, the work proposed here aims toward a vision of ""ubiquitious media access"", wherein commodity devices---which can be expected to be abundant, vastly diverse, multimedia-capable, and network capable---are able to act as endpoints for the streaming of continuous media, effectively and in a co-ordinated fashion, thereby forming the basis for a broad range of new distributed applications.

"Knowledge about root biomass growth and turnover is required to accurately estimate carbon storage and dynamics in forest ecosystems. Species and locale-specific data on belowground biomass is very limited. This research will evaluate biomass dynamics and net primary production (reflecting the net carbon balance resulting from growth and death) of root systems of balsam fir and sugar maple. It will focus on effects of the climate and forest management on biomass dynamics and allocation of carbon to root systems of the trees. It will provide species-specific data enabling verification of current approaches to estimating belowground biomass and carbon stocks of Maritime forests. It will improve the ability to model potential effects of climate change and of forest management practices that alter biomass balance by removing some and leaving some to decay, and that changes tree density and, consequently, growth conditions for residual trees.  Studies of root biomass dynamics are difficult because roots are not easily accessible for measurements.  Dynamics of fine roots will be determined from measurements made on images from transparent tubes (minirhizitrons) inserted into the soil and by evaluating and weighing roots recovered from soil cores.  These methods evaluate the abundance and longevity of fine roots enabling the estimate of their biomass dynamics.  Coarse roots will be excavated with compressed air and their dry biomass will be determined at the laboratory.  Equations for estimating the biomass of coarse roots from easier to measure aboveground characteristics will be developed and compared among the study sites. A new method of estimating net primary productivity of coarse roots will be developed for determining year-to year variation in belowground biomass and carbon dynamics.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Forestry and Environmental Management, Faculty of","Krasowski, Marek","RGPIN ",Silviculture,"Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",3-3

"In my research I am developing new mathematical methods to investigate the impact of symmetries on dynamical systems. One can easily observe that almost every design (e.g. buildings, networks, configurations of devices, etc.) has certain symmetries, which are expressions of our tendencies for elegance. Very little is known, how symmetries affect the performance or reliability of such design (e.g.  the earthquake resistance of buildings, electric systems, chemical processes). Even in simple models there are difficult problems leading to complicated analysis involving advanced algebraic and analytic method. My research area, the Equivariant Analysis, is focused on creating new tools (for example the equivariant degree) allowing effective and complete study of symmetric dynamical processes. My interests are two folded: theoretical and applied. In the theoretical part, based on the most recent achievements in various mathematical fields (such as algebraic and equivariant topology, transformation groups, algebra, differential geometry, differential equations, functional analysis, etc.), I am trying to understand the complex nature of abstract nonlinear symmetric equations, so it becomes possible to extract essential information about the solutions and their symmetric properties. This information leads to a development of new computational methods (involving algebraic, topological and analytical routines). In the applied part, we establish standard settings and create comprehensive routines, which allow usage of computers (e.g. Maple package was created for several groups of symmetries) in order to provide the user with quick and precise way to analyze dynamical systems, making our theoretical achievements accessible to applied mathematicians and even engineers. Our methods were used, for example, to investigate symmetric configurations of (electrical, chemical or biological) oscillators, in population models, or electrical transmission lines.

"The northern boreal forests of the Yukon are dominated by the 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares. The hare cycle is largely driven by predation from lynx and coyotes, as well as birds of prey. Hare reproduction fails during the decline phase of the cycle and we are testing the idea that stress caused by predation risk reduces reproductive output, and that stress effects are inherited maternally. 

Arctic ground squirrels are an abundant herbivore in the Yukon boreal zone but since 2002 they have nearly disappeared from the forests of the southern Yukon. We will test the suggestion that alpine populations of ground squirrels serve as a source population for valley populations in the forest, and that heavy predation has reduced colonization from the alpine populations. These studies will be carried out at Kluane Lake, Yukon. 

Brown lemmings and tundra voles live in tundra areas along the western edge of the arctic coastal plain of the north Yukon, and their population fluctuations could be explained in part by the same stress hypothesis that we are applying to snowshoe hares. We will measure stress levels in lemmings and voles throughout a population fluctuation to determine if high density is associated with high stress levels that persist into a population decline. An alternative view is that silica in grasses and sedges is a plant defense compound that reduces reproductive output and growth once these plants are grazed by lemmings or voles. We will measure silica levels in the major plant foods to test this idea. There is potential for competition between tundra voles and brown lemmings since they live in the same habitat. Tundra voles replace brown lemmings as one moves south out of the tundra, and competition for food or space is one possible explanation. These studies will be carried out on the Yukon arctic coast at Komakuk Beach, Yukon.

"With climate change increased perturbations of the forest ecosystem are expected, including range expansion and survival of insect pests. Not only would there be an expanded range of native insects but also some insects are expected to expand further northward into Canada. If left unchecked this will inevitably lead to increased defoliation damage thereby impacting the biodiversity of the species within them and significantly affecting the forestry industry which contributes about $30 billion annually to our balance of trade. Canada could choose to do nothing. Or it could choose to be proactive and devise strategies on how best to preserve our valuable Canadian forest resource and carbon sink in preparation for this inevitability. Our proposal addresses the need for alternative, biological, insect pest control agents, targeted to specific forest pests by harnessing the many advantages of viral based insecticides (specificity, ease of production, native to the ecosystem), but modified to make them more effective. In particular we are developing a platform technology, virus reprogramming, to make any baculovirus more effective. Two virus enzymes, chitinase and cathepsin, normally produced during virus infection, serve to destroy the structural integrity of the diseased insect causing it to literally liquefy. Our reprogrammed native viruses will be designed to produce greater amounts of these two enzymes and at earlier times after infection. We expect the larvae to be killed earlier than normal, thereby reducing feeding damage.  To make these changes we would use the virus's own genetic control elements to effect this reprogramming.  While initially targeting a baculovirus against the spruce budworm this platform technology could easily be expanded to other forest (and agricultural) insect pest species. Recognizing also that new pests will expand into the Canadian forest and range of native ones will increase, we will also develop a panel of insect cell lines to a

variety of such species. These cell lines are critical reagents to help identify, characterize and perhaps manipulate additional microbial pest control agents for these species. Moreover such cell lines are needed for scale up of virus production and quality control.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Molecular and Cellular Biology","Krell, Peter","STPGP ",Virology,Microbiology,Microbiologie,2-3
"While much is known (and still unknown) about the interactions between mammalian viruses and their host cells that between insect viruses and insect cells is poorly understood. Baculoviruses are unique to insects and as such their study should reveal novel aspects of their replication strategies. This proposal involves two baculoviruses. CfMNPV infects the spruce budworm (a major defoliator in Canadian forests) and AcMNPV infects many lepidopteran insects, particularly pests of agricultural crops. With about 150 baculovirus genes, there is a need to regulate when and at what levels those genes are expressed. It would be wasteful if all genes were expressed simultaneously and at the same level. Some virus products are needed at only low amounts and early in infection (e.g. enzymes for DNA replication) whereas others are needed in higher amounts and later in infection (e.g. virion proteins). Similarly viral DNA replication, which occurs before viral assembly, requires prior production of viral DNA polymerase. This study focuses on genome transcriptional regulation and viral DNA replication. In particular we will characterize two baculovirus proteins, ME53 and Cf103 both of which may be involved in regulation of gene expression. We will determine when these proteins and their transcripts are made, where in the cells these proteins are localized, what viral and cellular proteins or DNA sequences they interact with (and how) and evaluate how they influence the expression of other baculovirus genes (we already know that Cf103 delays expression of late genes). We noted that CfMNPV generates several antisense, non-coding RNAs. While this may be a natural consequence of transcription of upstream sense mRNAs we feel some of the antisense transcripts have a regulatory role in the virus replication cycle, perhaps using RNA silencing, and we wish to address that hypothesis. In addition, since viral DNA replication is such a central feature of the virus replication cycle we wish to determine the mechanism of DNA replication. To that end we will try to identify where on the DNA genome replication actually starts (an ori of DNA replication) and what viral and cellular components exist at the origin of replication complex (ORC).

Emphasis is on learning algorithms that learn to classify, generate and transmute sequences of symbols based

on example sequences. Over the past 10 years a number of new approaches to inducing sequences have been

proposed by myself and other researchers in the field. These have been sparsely applied to selected

bioinformatics problems and analysed.



The objectives of this research are to discover which techniques work best on which problems, and how these

methods can be adapted to the unique constraints arrising from practical problems on real biological datasets.

This will allow scientists working in bioinformatics to judiciously apply these techniques to problems of

interest as well as provide some insight into alternative approaches that might not otherwise be considered. It

will effect an easier transfer of knowledge from research in machine learning to practical bioinformatics

problems.



The research will focus on (but not be limited to) the following techniques: artificial neural networks,

automata models, formal grammars and hidden Markov models.



The research is a follow-up to-- and extension of-- previous work in this area at a much enhanced scale. This

"Recent technological breakthroughs in cryogenic cooling and trapping of molecular ensembles have created an entirely new field of ultracold physics. At unprecedentedly low temperatures, ultracold materials offer access to new states of matter, unachievable by any other means, and new possibilities to study a wide range of fundamental problems in natural sciences. This proposal aims to capitalize on these recent developments in low-temperature physics by establishing a research program to study ultracold chemistry. The proposed research will explore novel methods to create and thermally isolate molecules at temperatures near absolute zero (1 nanoKelvin - 1 Kelvin) and interaction properties of ultracold molecules in electric and magnetic field traps. We will develop theoretical and computational methods to study, for the first time, a wide range of novel phenomena such as the effects of electromagnetic fields on chemical reactivity of atoms and molecules with unpaired electrons, the role of tunable fine interactions in chemical reactions at low temperatures and chemical reactions accompanied by emission or adsorption of laser field photons. We will explore the effects of external space symmetry on chemical interactions of molecules confined in low dimensions by optical laser forces and the interaction properties of ultracold molecules arranged by laser fields in an ordered structure called optical lattice. We propose to design an optical lattice of molecules with collective rotational excitations coupled to laser field photons - a system that will provide new fundamental insights into dynamics of two- and many-body quantum systems and that may find applications in the study of nanoscale quantum optical devices. This work will open up a new research field of cold controlled chemistry and stimulate the development of novel experiments in physical chemistry, atomic, molecular and optical physics and quantum optics. Controlling chemical reactions with electromagnetic fields has long been a sought-after goal of researchers. Due to the rapid progress of the experimental work with molecules at subKelvin temperatures, the conditions are now ripe for the development of the research field of cold controlled chemistry.

"The phase equilibrium of industrially significant blends of conventional and biodegradable polymer solutions will be measured experimentally and a computational tool that simulates the industrial production processes will be created.  Process simulators are computational tools that enable engineers to evaluate different configurations and operating conditions during plant design and operation to reduce the consumption of raw materials, improve product quality, and identify potential public safety and environmental concerns.

The objective of this research is to improve the robustness, speed, and accuracy of the thermodynamic algorithms for process simulation in general, while implementing a new specialized algorithm for multiple polydisperse compounds.  Polymers are classic examples of polydisperse compounds since they contain a collection of similar molecules of different molecular lengths.  Blending polymers together can produce materials with improved strength and durability.

Three polymer blends that could produced in solution are selected for this study.  Polyethylene and polystyrene are conventional polymers produced in Canada by Nova Chemicals Corporation and have well-defined chemical structures that will allow for the construction of a generalized model.  This model can be used to evaluate ways to reduce the consumption of raw materials in existing chemical plants.  Biodegradable polycaprolactone can be blended with non-biodegradable polymethyl methacrylate for biomedical applications.  Rigorous simulation of these polymer blends in solution will improve plant design by allowing engineers to examine alternative plant configurations and help in identifying potential environmental and safety concerns during the design stage.

"Over the last few years, I have been excited by a group of proteins, ubiquitously present in the human body and other mammals that can self-assemble into ultrathin filaments. These ""intermediate filaments"" are responsible for the unique mechanical properties of some of our tissues, like the upper layer of the skin and our hairs. They are also important structural elements of each of our cells.

The aim of this proposal is to obtain a structural understanding of the mechanical properties of individual filaments. I am especially interested in elucidating how the self-assembly process generates mechanical properties that are different from the ones of the protein building-blocks. This self-assembled protein system offers us an opportunity to learn from nature in order to design nanomaterials with tailored mechanical properties.

To achieve this goal, I propose to develop atomic force microscopy approaches to probe the mechanical properties of protein assemblies in aqueous solution. I will also use a strategy based on counter-ion condensation, a well-known mechanism in soft condensed matter physics, to assemble these filaments into micro- and macro-scale fibers or networks that will serve as a proof of principle for protein based materials. Possible applications include textiles, tissue engineering scaffolds, and high-specificity membranes for filtration. The last application will take advantage of the fact that the protein building-blocks can in theory be functionalized while conserving potent self-assembly properties.

If all this works, I will have at hand a tunable system that I will use to explore the role of protein domains, ionic conditions and crosslinkers on the mechanical properties of filamentous networks at distance scales of nanometer to centimeter. This knowledge will be essential to understand the material behaviours of living cells and tissues.

"Fluid mixing appears in industrial processes ranging from blending to multiphase flows (solids distribution, liquid emulsification, and gas dispersion), reactors (for polymerization, fine chemicals and leaching of mineral ores), and complex multimechanism applications (production of emulsions in the cosmetics industry, mixing of doughs in the food industry, and crystallization in pharmaceuticals and photographic chemicals).

  In this proposal, spatial statistics is applied to mixing problems for the first time. Tools developed and validated in population ecology, racial segregation studies, geostatistics, and spatial statistics will be used to provide links between simulations, high speed digital images, and modelling. My goal is to develop meaningful data reduction methods to support physical understanding, design, and modelling capability in the face of an avalanche of high quality data.  Expected outcomes are:

1) Definition: Starting from existing definitions of mixing segregation in spatial statistics, chemical engineering and chaotic mixing, develop a fundamental, rigorous definition of mixing which is applicable across the wide range of problems currently classified as ""Industrial Mixing.""

2) Analysis Toolkit:  Apply the range of spatial statistics analysis tools to mixing problems. The contribution is not the tools themselves, but their application to a new set of problems. It is important to test and illustrate their strengths, weaknesses, and usefulness for these new applications. Key tools include the point-nearest neighbor measures of clustering, randomness, and homogeneity; the modifiable areal unit constraint; and a range of sampling methods, such as transcept sampling, that are new to chemical engineers.

3) Theoretical Development:  Use the definition and analysis tools to revisit the theory and science of mixing with new eyes, allowing better modelling and analysis of complex, multimechanism problems through approaches such as the ""mixing field"" and reduced mixing volumes.

4) Extend the results to multiphase flows, combustion, and reactor design in other geometries.

"Gases in contact with the surfaces of a solid will modify them leading to their pasivation, such as hydrogen in contact with silicon, or corrode them, such as oxygen or sulfur in contact with metals. Solid surfaces can also act as catalysts for chemical reactions, e.g. platinum alloys can oxidize carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and certain iron ores can turn atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia fertilizers (Haber-Bosch catalysts). Our theory of adsorption, desorption and surface reactions examines the microscopic basis underlying such processes in order to help develop new catalysts and further optimize existing ones.

Polymers are long macromolecules with many identical repeat units. They are used in plastics, paints and as corrosion resistant coatings. We are developing a first principles theory that traces the macroscopic properties of polymers to their underlying microscopic origin. Of  interest to us are coatings of implants and their resistance to adsorption of proteins from the blood. More generally we are studying the interaction of polymers with water and their mechanical response.

We have developed digital in-line holography into a new microscopic tool with which micron-sized objects, such as defects in solids, debris in jet streams, marine plankton, algae, bacteria etc. can be visualized in three dimensions. The motion of many such objects can be followed simultaneously as a function of time visualizing their tracks in 3D.

"Sound statistical methods are essential for a proper evaluation of toxicological and epidemiological data on potential risks to the health of Canadians.  The present research program focuses on six objectives.  (1) The World Health Organization estimates that approximately one-quarter of global burden of illness and more than one-third for children is attributable to environmental factors.  An assessment of the environmental burden of disease in Canada will be conducted using similar methods.  (2) To ensure that population based studies of potential human health risks provide risk estimates that are as accurate as possible, statistical methods for assessing exposure measurement errors in such studies will be developed.  (3) Models for predicting the risks of animal diseases that may be transmitted to humans will be developed, and applied to predict the risks of chronic wasting disease, which is now found in Alberta and Saskatchewan.  (4)  Statistical methods for describing dose-response curves for essential elements such as copper that are also toxic at high doses will be developed.  These methods can then be used to establish a range of allowable daily intakes of essential elements.  (5)  With the anticipated explosion in the use of in vitro tests for toxicological risk assessment, there is a pressing need for the development of statistical methods capable of analyzing the large volumes of data that will be produced in laboratory studies of toxicity in the future.

"As computer chips and transistors shrink in size, engineers will eventually be forced to use objects such as electrons and atoms to encode bits of information, and hence will be forced to deal with the mysterious ""quantum world"". Scientists have recognized this as a central issue for several decades, but only within the past decade was it shown that quantum effects could be harnessed for a new kind of ""quantum computing"" that would quite simply revolutionize the world of computing and cryptography, as we know it. The experimental and theoretical progress of recent years has generated tremendous excitement within the scientific community, but there are still many fundamental issues to overcome if the promises of quantum computing and cryptography are to be realized. Extending these successes to large-scale many body quantum systems is one of the most difficult and intriguing problems in modern science. 



While the use of quantum mechanics in the context of computing enables fascinating possibilities, it also presents daunting new challenges. Of central importance is the need to mitigate the effects of errors induced by environmental noise that disrupt attempts to control and maintain features of quantum systems as they evolve in time. Even though substantial progress has been made on this front, the basic problem of ""quantum error correction"" remains one of the primary impediments to large-scale quantum computing. This research program goes directly to the heart of the matter. The overarching goal of the research is to find new techniques, and further develop established technologies, for error correction in quantum computing. The methodological approach is rooted in mathematics, and the interdisciplinary nature of the research provides opportunities to apply tools from physics. A significant goal of the research is to synthesize theory with experiment in quantum computing. Another important goal is to apply these investigations to other emerging disciplines of quantum information science, such as quantum cryptography and quantum gravity.

"Experimental high-energy physics is almost entirely carried out by large international collaborations based at a very few facilities located around the world. The University of Toronto is currently involved in two of the most high-profile new experiments in the world, the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, which will study physics at an entirely new energy scale, and the T2K experiment in Japan, which will provide precision measurements in the neutrino sector of the Standard Model. Additionally, we are involved with R&D related to future accelerators, with research on the design, construction and testing of superconducting RF cavities for an electron linear accelerator. The infrastructure needed to maintain both existing and future research efforts is substantial. For instance, the large volumes of data that will be produced by the LHC experiments have lead to a grid computing model in which data will be distributed amongst computer centres around the world. These centres are of different sizes, referred to as Tier-0 (at CERN), Tier-1 (there are 10 around the world, with one located at TRIUMF), Tier-2 and Tier-3. There will be two Tier-2 centres in Canada, with the largest situated mainly at the University of Toronto, as part of the SciNet computing facilities funded through the CFI. The purchase and installation of this facility is now in progress. However, for some years we have had a 500-cpu Linux cluster financed in a previous CFI competition, and since 2004 we have employed an MFA-funded person responsible for managing the scientific use of this cluster, in support of the various experimental groups. This person has played a key role in the design of the SciNet facility, and is expect to continue this level of involvement. Additionally we currently support a High-Energy Physics Engineer, who has played key roles in the group's hardware contributions to both ATLAS and T2K. His expertise will be needed during at least the initial T2K running, and access to his skills also forms an important part of our plans for R&D on ATLAS upgrades and superconducting RF cavities. In addition, reinstating an Instrumentation Technologist position is crucial to the continuation of our work in these fields.

"The ever increasing quest for improved productivity and material performance in various industries has led to the development of a new generation of advanced materials and new processing technologies to further enhance their intrinsic capabilities. These materials, particularly advanced structural and die steels, being relatively new, there is the compelling need to develop a better understanding of the effect of alloying and processing (heat treatment and surface engineering) on their microstructure and mechanical properties before their full potentialities can be exploited. In this context, the present study has two main objectives: (1) application of HSLA steel technology to the development of  (a) 690-900 MPa grade, tough, and formable structural shapes (bars and rounds)  and thin strips); (2) Improving die life and performance through optimization of matrix composition, heat treatment  including deep cryogenics and selective surface engineering.  Both commercial and experimental advanced steels will be used. Specific combination of heat treatment and surface engineering treatments will be selected based on the need to fill in the fundamental knowledge gap in processing-structure-property relations. It is anticipated that the completion of the project will broaden the technological know-how and the scientific basis for the improving the productivity of Canadian manufacturers in the area of civilian infrastructure, mining, heavy machinery, automotive and aerospace.

"Enterprise applications support critical business processes such as Web-based retailing,  payroll processing, and customer relationship management.  In recent years, the utility computing paradigm is emerging as a cost-effective and adaptive mechanism for ensuring the performance of enterprise applications.  A fundamental aspect of the utility paradigm is that resources can be dynamically provisioned to applications.  This can prevent resource under-utilization and enable agility in assigning resources where they are needed the most.  

    Effective performance management tools are crucial for enterprise applications to fully exploit the gains from utility computing.  For example, capacity sizing tools are needed to provide insights on how best to reconfigure a utility (e.g., reassign resources among applications) for handling anticipated changes to application workloads.  In spite of the growing interest in utility computing, very little research exists on techniques for enabling such tasks for enterprise applications.

    The applicant proposes research initiatives to facilitate performance management tasks.  Specifically, the research efforts will focus on achieving the following objectives. 1) Designing a Utility Information Service - The research will devise a service that provides tools seamless access to information that enables performance management tasks. 2) Devising a Capacity Sizing Process - The research will devolop a capacity sizing process that can help utility operators ensure adequate resources are provisioned to an application to meet its performance objectives.

    The proposed research will address several unique challenges.  Firstly, the research will identify the types of information required for carrying out essential performance management tasks in a utility setting.  Secondly, to facilitate tool portability the work will develop new information models that are capable of describing utility systems.  Finally, the work will investigate new performance testing and performance modeling techniques specifically intended for supporting capacity sizing of utility-enabled enterprise applications.

"This project deals with surveillance applications using multifunction radars in the recently launched RADARSAT-2 space-based radar and airborne radars (such as Canada's fleet of CP140 Aurora patrol aircraft). Such multifunction radars are sophisticated sensors that can operate in multiple modes. Our aim is to develop sensor signal processing and information management algorithms for land and coastal surveillance of  moving vehicles/ships. The goal is to conduct research in two important functionalities for such next-generation radar systems. (i) Meta-level tracking: Our first objective is to develop algorithms that can monitor macro-level behavior of multiple moving targets such as vehicles moving in a convoy, or a vehicle circling the perimeter of a building. (ii) The second objective is to develop sophisticated stochastic feedback control algorithms that enable the radar to adapt dynamically to its environment. That is, we will conduct research in developing algorithms so that radars can autonomously change their transmit waveforms, beam pointing directions, dwell times, etc. 

Until very recently, both these aspects were controlled by human radar operators. For the full potential of multi-function radars to be harnessed there are compelling reasons to automate these procedures.  Our vision is to develop a cognitive radar that autonomously adapts its operating mode in real time to track multiple moving targets. The project will involve significant collaboration with Vancouver based company MacDonald Dettwiler (who is the primary contractor for RADARSAT-2) and Defense Research Development Canada. The algorithms developed will be evaluated on actual radar experiments conducted by MacDonald Dettwiler and Defense Research Development Ottawa. This project also involves collaboration with Georgia Institute of Technology Research Institute. It is hoped that the new algorithms, analysis and design tools from this project will lead to new sensor and information management techniques for high performance radars and networks of radars.

"Statistical signal processing deals with extracting signals from noisy measurements. In this project, motivated by energy, communication and computational constraints, we address the deeper issue of how to dynamically schedule and optimize signal processing resources to extract signals from noisy measurements. Such sensor scheduling/management problems involve the interplay of ideas in Bayesian signal processing, stochastic optimization, stochastic control and game theory. Our research involves four inter-related parts. In Part 1, we conduct fundamental research on the structural properties of  sensor management problems formulated as constrained Markov decision processes, partially obeserved Markov decision processes and stochastic games. In Part 2, we exploit the structure in Part 1 to derive sophisticated simulation-based optimization algorithms for sensor management. In Part 3, we exploit the fundamental results in Part 1 and Part 2 to design and analyse efficient algorithms for networked sensors in surveillance and radar resource management. In Part 4, we use the fundamental results in Part 2 to devise efficient multiparticle Brownian dynamics and Molecular dynamics simulation of ion permeation in biological membrane ion channels. The key idea underpinning our research is the study of stochastic scheduling and games for dynamical systems. This unifying theme motivates our fundamental theory and applications. 

The outcomes of this project are twofold: (i) Novel theoretical developments and analysis in the structure of sensor scheduling policies (ii) Computationally efficient numerical algorithms and associated convergence analysis in sensor scheduling and large-scale interacting particle simulation. These algorithms will serve as useful computational tools for radar resource management, sensor networks and computational biophysics. 

 To achieve our objectives we will use powerful analysis tools such as supermodularity, weak convergence, analysis of differential inclusions, and game theoretic ideas such as global games and correlated equilibria. Many of these fundamental tools are motivated by recent advances in the economics literature.

"This proposal is aimed at the development of new high-order adaptive algorithms for the numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws using discontinuous Galerkin methods (DGM). These methods are becoming important  for the computation of  solutions of large scale problems modeled by partial differential equations. Their attractive features are an element-wise conservation property, high-order accuracy, easy adaptivity, and simple parallel solution procedures. They are used in such diverse applications as fluid dynamics, aeroacoustics, electromagnetics, and optics. This work will lead to more accurate computer simulations and shorter design times.



By representing the solution via a high-order basis, the DGM is capable of computing a highly accurate numerical solution. For the method to be competitive, it must do so efficiently and rapidly. This proposal will develop several tools in that direction. Adaptive algorithms concentrate computing resources in regions where they are most needed. Thus, fewer cells are needed to achieve the prescribed accuracy. New adaptive algorithms capable of combining two types of adaptivity: h-refinement (mesh enrichment) and p-refinement (order variation) will be developed.  New stabilizing (limiting) techniques will be investigated for such fully adaptive schemes. We will further seek efficiency by developing a time-adaptive scheme for the method of lines with explicit Runge-Kutta time integrators. By using a local time step on each cell, the scheme will need an overall fewer number of function evaluations. Thus, the simulation will be completed in a shorter time. We then will develop a discontinuous Galerkin method on Cartesian grids with embedded boundaries. Such grids are easier to construct and faster to compute on than unstructured triangular/ tetrahedral meshes. Training of graduate and undergraduate students will be an important component of the proposed program.

"Precise uranium-lead analyses of minute (microgram) quantities of the mineral 'zircon' that crystallize during formation, reheating, or ductile flow events provide detailed scenarios of the evolution of the Earth's crust during periods of mountain building. When enormous continental plates collide, this produces over-thickened stacks of crustal rocks such that the lower part of the thrust stack is heated from below and softened and slides further inland. This must have happened under the Rocky Mountains as this thick pile of sedimentary material, once at the ocean bottom, now sits above an older continent. To understand processes that took place along the interface, 10 - 20 km below the Earth's surface where we cannot see, we must find a very old mountain root where the mountains have since been removed by erosion. The Grenville Province, well exposed along Georgian Bay, Ontario, is such a root. Here, geologists who study the rock record observe both the old, cold solid lower plate and the soft, hot overlying rocks that moved overtop during a great plate collision more than a billion years ago. In short, we discover the nature of the processes that put the Rockies in their place.

   The evolution of life on Earth has been subject to sudden drastic losses of species over brief time intervals that are recorded in the rock record. These mass extinction events can be correlated with meteorite impacts and major volcanic eruptions. Using high resolution U-Pb dating methods we can accurately pinpoint the time of these meteoritic/volcanic events and establish or refute synchronicity with the extinction events by dating volcanic ash beds that occur near the extinction horizons.

   My research also involves new strategies in the field to select rocks in complex gneiss terranes that give age information directly tied to once active tectonic processes. I am also developing methods in the laboratory to better resolve complex, multi-stage, zircon populations that occur in metamorphic rocks, and to make U-Pb ages more precise.

"The use of natural product-based remedies to maintain good health or treat disease has been known for centuries, and in recent years the use of natural health products has increased in Canada. Although natural health products in Canada are being held to tougher standards than previously, a great deal remains poorly understood regarding whether any of these products actually provide any beneficial effects. Our research is aimed at developing a better understanding of how some natural health products work. Any beneficial effects observed for natural health products would be the result of the actions of the specific natural products present. We are interested in learning about the complex fundamental chemical properties of these natural products, and how these chemical properties may help us to learn about the health benefits that they may cause.

One area of research studies a group of compounds called lignans. Lignans in flaxseed are associated with improved heart health among others, whereas other lignans, such as those found in creosote bush, can have either beneficial effects or cause toxicity. We recently confirmed that this toxicity can be explained by a reaction that a lignan undergoes to produce a toxic compound; what causes the beneficial effects remains unknown.

Another area of study centres on natural products called flavonoids that are thought to be present in some plants as a way of protecting against potential damage from the sun, a sort of plant sunscreen. We have reasoned that these natural products may also have the potential to be used as sunscreens for human protection against sun damage. We are actively studying what happens to flavonoids when they are exposed to simulated sunlight and what types of reactions they may be involved in that could provide protection to human skin.

"Heat shock proteins (hsps) were originally identified as proteins expressed following exposure of cells to environmental stress such as elevated temperature or toxic metals.  Several hsps were subsequently shown to also play important roles as molecular chaperones in normal intracellular protein folding and targeting events, and to be expressed during discrete periods during the development of a number of embryonic tissues.  Hsp gene expression is regulated in large part by a small family of transcription factors known as heat shock factors (HSFs).    We have shown that the zebrafish hsp70 gene is expressed during a distinct temporal window of normal embryonic lens formation from 28-38 hours post fertilization (hpf) under non-stress conditions, that it is required for normal lens formation, and that lens-specific expression requires the activity of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1).  We have also found that the hsp70 gene is strongly upregulated in larval stage zebrafish following exposure to the toxic metal cadmium, and that this stress-induced upregulation occurs in a tissue-specific manner with strong expression in the olfactory neurons and lateral line neuromasts, both important sensory cells in fish.    Experiments in this proposal will be aimed at defining the mechanisms by which constitutive lens-specific expression and cadmium-induced olfactory neuron expression of the hsp70 gene are regulated, and the transcription factors involved.   Other experiments will further examine the role of the hsp70 gene product in lens formation, particularly in the attenuated apoptotic-like process by which lens fibre organelles are destroyed in order to produce a transparent lens.   These experiments will advance our understanding of how expression of a single gene is co-ordinated in a cell-specific manner under different environmental conditions in the context of the intact, developing organism.  The end goal of this research program is to generate a comprehensive picture that integrates heat shock gene expression and function into the development and physiology of the developing embryo.

"Our laboratory studies the physiological ecology of nutrient acquisition in terrestrial plants. It examines the role of nutrient ion fluxes at cellular, whole-organism, and ecosystem levels, in several key areas: nutrition and yield potential in cereals, forest succession, cellular ionic interactions, nutrient ion toxicities, and salt stress. The current lead foci are the acquisition mechanisms for the macronutrients nitrogen and potassium, mechanisms for the toxic entry of sodium, and the energy cost of flux mechanisms at the plasma membrane of root cells. The experimental approach draws heavily upon recent molecular discoveries and ranges from the high-precision measurement of nutrient fluxes using radiotracers to the use of ion-selective electrodes and fluorescence dyes, ionic and metabolic profiling of tissues, respiration analysis, growth trials, and mathematical modeling of cellular flux processes. The laboratory is known for its investigation of the nutrient physiology of intact plants, the development of novel methods to tackle the complexities associated with whole systems, and its focus on species of agricultural and silvicultural importance.



We hope to make fundamental contributions to the understanding of wild-genotype and crop nutrient physiology, to design new recommendations for the sustainable management of agricultural and silvicultural systems, and to be instrumental in the development of crop cultivars with improved tolerance to stressed environments.

"The primary theme in this research program is to bring together state-of-the-art methods in scientific computing, physical modeling, and classical methods in applied mathematical analysis for studying problems that arise in fluid dynamics and material science. Mathematically, the equations to be solved are high-order, nonlinear partial differential equations, and the domains are often extremely complex. The underlying computational framework is to employ, whenever indicated, ``designer'' algorithms, i.e. those that target specific problems. These modern and powerful computational methods are able to accurately capture the solution of a problem by  fully exploiting its underlying analytical structure. This is in contrast to more standard numerical methods that have been developed to have the widest possible application.



One main thrust of this proposal is to develop integral equation methods for the Navier-Stokes

equations. These methods have the potential to offer an exciting alternative to conventional finite difference or finite elements, and they offer significant advantages:  complex physical boundaries are easy to incorporate and the ill-conditioning associated with direct discretization of the governing partial differential equations is avoided. To date, an integral equation approach has been deemed impractical as a general tool because of the apparent computational expense. We intend to ameliorate this expense by employing fast algorithms, such as the Fast Multipole Method. We have been successful in developing methods for the Stokes equations, and have recently used these tools to investigate particle simulations, and interfacial motion.



A new area of research interest will be to investigate periodic pattern morphologies, with a physical example being phase separation in block copolymer melts. Again, the governing equations are high-order, nonlinear partial differential equations (Cahn-Hilliard like).

"The growing demand for fast, accurate and reliable quality inspection tools for the food processing industry has been driven by a number of factors; more stringent government safety standards, rising labor costs, and increased consumer expectations for higher quality food products.  In many food processing applications, human inspectors are simply too subjective and unreliable given the time allotted to perform the inspection task and the tedious nature of the work. For these reasons, computer vision is proving to be a rapid, objective and cost effective alternative to human inspection for a growing number of food products. However, significant technological challenges remain particularly with respect to the inspection of ""natural foods"" such as fish and poultry. The proposed research program addresses these challenges though the development of both computer vision hardware and image analysis tools specifically for the automated inspection of natural foods. The ultimate goal is the development of a rapid, objective, robust and cost effective automated inspection system that improves food quality and consumer safety. The proposed research program is based on the hypothesis that no single detection technology will ever adequately satisfy the requirements of the food processing industry.  A more promising approach is to base the inspection on multiple images acquired using various regions of the EM spectrum (visible, near-infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray) combined with different illumination strategies (reflection, trans-illumination, fluorescence). This approach (i.e., real-time multispectral image fusion) can potentially provide the basis for an accurate and robust automated food inspection system. In order to achieve real-time performance, research will focus on implementing high level image processing functions in hardware with the long-term goal of developing an ""intelligent"" camera for automated inspection that incorporates an entire vision system within a single compact enclosure. The development of such advanced technology for food inspection is critical to Canada both for addressing increasingly sophisticated consumer demands and ensuring food safety and competitiveness in an increasingly global marketplace.

"Due to the combination of properties such as high strength, fracture toughness and good high temperature strength, silicon nitride ceramics have become the leading structural ceramics in many industries including automotive, cutting tools, aerospace and armour industries. Recently, silicon nitride has been identified for yet another application such as biomaterials for the manufacture of artificial bones and implants. In all of the above noted applications, the key requirements are the combination of high fracture strength (well over 1000MPa), fracture toughness (well above 10 MPa.m1/2), hardness (well above 10 GPa) and Young's modulus (over 300 GPa). The long term objective in this program is the development of a microstructure capable of providing higher resistance to crack propagation and resulting in a new generation of silicon nitride based ceramics with mechanical properties superior to those of the existing material and possibly close to that of some lower toughness metals and alloys such as aluminum and aluminum alloys. The short term objective is to study the role of non-oxide additives such as nitrides (boron nitride, zirconium nitride, etc.) in the densification, microstructure development and mechanical properties. The strategy here is to encourage the growth of elongated �-Si3N3 grains and to modify the interface in order to intensify the pull-out and crack bridging. Crack bridging has been identified as the major and most powerful mechanism of toughening in silicon nitride based ceramics. The present research program is based on the applicant's preliminary studies where it has been shown that major increases in fracture toughness are possible when selected additives are used. In one instance, fracture toughness of >14 MPa.m1/.2 was measured. To the applicant's knowledge this value for fracture toughness is the highest ever recorded in the open literature. Successful outcome of this program will lead to the creation of a new class of ceramics with a combination of properties unmatched in the past. It will also provide the opportunity for training of graduate students, PDFs and Research Associates in this rapidly growing area of advanced ceramics in automotive, aerospace and energy sectors.

"Nanocomposites are organic/inorganic materials, in which inorganic nanofillers are dispersed in a polymer matrix. After adding nanofillers to the matrix material, the resulting nanocomposites may exhibit drastically enhanced properties. 



In this research program it is proposed to explore and optimize a novel method for synthesis of nanocomposites from incompatible polymer and inorganic phases, which was developed in our laboratory. The synthesized nanocomposites will be used in membrane gas separation applications, in particular those involving separations of carbon dioxide from oxygen, nitrogen and methane. These separations are very important from the perspective of minimizing carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere, and as such, this research program will play a key role in addressing global warming/climate change concerns, which represent the major challenge of our time. 



While this research program is mainly oriented on the development of materials for superior gas separation membranes, the new materials might prove to be useful in other membrane separations as well as in non-membrane applications. In addition, optimization of our method will greatly expand the number of possible combinations of polymer/inorganic systems, from which nanocomposites can be prepared, and as such this research will provide an important contribution to the rapidly growing field of nanotechnology.

"Quantum Dots (QDs) represent one newer form of technology that is now being exploited for the detection and tracking of dynamic cellular events in living systems. The goal of this research is to develop a manufacturing process that will offer a new tool for nucleic acid diagnostics at the cellular and intracellular levels, to ultimately enable the early detection of disease and to monitor disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. Two technology platforms are required to achieve the manufacturing goal: 1. We will design and construct a microfluidic reactor and suitable surface chemistries to produce QD-biosensors. The reactor will be based on solid-phase synthetic modification of immobilized QDs. Biosensors will be based on oligonucleotides that are immobilized on QDs, with the transduction system operated in fluorescence resonance energy transfer mode. The biosensors will be self-contained, meaning that fluorescently labelled nucleic acid targets are not required. Small molecule and peptide tags will be co-immobilized with oligonucleotides onto the QDs as a vector to selectively deliver QD-biosensors to targeted cells. In collaboration with our industry partner GL Chemtec, we will develop synthetic methodologies and validate the quality of the products from the reactor. 2. We will design and construct a separate microfluidic tool for rapid assessment of the performance of QD-biosensors produced in the reactor. The microfluidic tool will allow for moderate throughput investigation of the interactions between QD-biosensors and individual living cells. This will allow evaluation of the performance of the functional materials, which will guide development and optimization of the design of the manufacturing process to improve performance of QD-biosensors.","Manufacturing processes and products","Manufacturing processes and products","Chemical and Physical Sciences","Krull, Ulrich","STPGP ",Biomaterials,"Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",1-3
"Investigation of biosensing motifs at a molecular scale offers direction for the creation of nanoparticle technologies and molecular switches. We have been exploring quantum dots (QDs) decorated with oligonucleotides as the basis for biosensors that operate using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), where the QD excites a nearby dye that is associated with formation of double-stranded DNA. There are fundamental challenges in learning how to construct organized oriented films of oligonucleotide probes on QDs for the design of fluorescence transduction by FRET while avoiding non-selective adsorption and undesired environmental quenching of QD emission. Using two-photon excitation, correlation spectroscopy and single-molecule detection strategies, we can develop an understanding of the dynamic function of immobilized oligonucleotides on QDs so as to move to rational design of nanoscale biosensors.    

   We propose new nanoscale signaling strategies involving structural switches that are activated by hybridization. Molecular self-assembly to immobilize single-stranded oligonucleotide probes and adjacent tethered intercalators is being explored using protein templates.  In this manner it is possible to develop self-contained molecular switches on QDs that spectroscopically activate upon hybridization. Another goal is to introduce multiple stem-loop oligonucleotide probes that target different sequences, and  immobilizing this conjugate on a QD. The intention is to build selective chemistry that will allow a single nanoparticle to offer a multiplexed signaling capability. Fuller utilization of capabilities of spectroscopic methods offer interesting opportunities for development of advantageous sensing strategies. Some QDs have a high cross-section for harmonic excitation, and in comparison to molecular fluorophores, can offer substantial enhancement of signal-to-noise, stability against photobleaching, and greater depth of spectroscopic investigation in biological samples. We will explore the design of selective surface chemistries for QD biosensors that can take advantage of harmonic signal generation.","Materials sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Chemical and Physical Sciences","Krull, Ulrich","RGPIN ","Bioanalytical chemistry","Analytical chemistry","Chimie analytique",1-5
"This proposal is directed at gaining an understanding of the fundamental chemical and physical processes leading to spatial modulations of surface structure & reactivity at the nanoscale. Nanostructured surfaces have many current and projected applications in micro- and nanoelectronics, biosensors, catalysis, solid state lighting, solar cells, fuel cells, anti-corrosion coatings, cell adhesion for biomaterials, etc. However, their economical production frequently presents a challenge and faces limitations due to a lack of control and fundamental understanding. In order to advance our ability to create suitable surfaces for all these applications, it is therefore necessary to understand the underlying chemistry and physics of pattern formation at a fundamental level. 

One of the most fundamental effects that can lead to pattern formation at surfaces is the modulation of the band structure of the substrate by chemisorbed small molecules. We are studying this effect in carbon nanotubes for the purpose of gaining spatial control over their sidewall functionalization. Even the routine procedure of dispensing carbon nanotubes in common solvents can lead to changes in their electronic structure due to doping effects, which are currently under detailed investigation. This knowledge will help us in the design of new functionalization reactions. 

Recently, we have discovered a dimpling process for metal surfaces that appears to be of general validity, and based on a non-linear process with a characteristic length scale of around 50nm. Immediately obvious applications are in biomaterials and catalysis. Patterned catalysts, for example, can be either used directly in fuel cells or for chemical reactions, or act as precursors for the growth of ordered nanowire arrays for use in sensors or photovoltaic devices. We propose working towards further understanding and modelling the underlying process and expanding it to a larger range of materials by developing appropriate chemistries for most common metals, alloys and semiconductors.

"Accurate modeling and animation of human and animal motion is difficult because it requires knowledge of anatomy, biomechanics, and neural control.  Motion capture has become popular for computer animation of humans and animals because it avoids this difficulty by directly capturing the subtleties of movement.  However, it can be difficult to modify motion capture to satisfy the constraints of a new animation because motion capture does not reveal how it was produced.  In this research program we intend to improve the animation of virtual humans and animals through a combination of physically based simulation, biomechanical models, approximations of neural control, and the capture of motion and contact forces.  Existing methods of estimating the passive behaviour of capture subjects will be validated, and new methods of estimating controlled stiffness changes will be investigated.  We will explore voluntary motions such as reaching, grasping, and rhythmic motions such as scratching and locomotion.

"The proposed instrument, a flow cytometer, is pivotal to our research on aptamer selection for targets on the cell surface and inside cells. Aptamers are short synthetic DNA (or RNA) oligonucleotides selected from large libraries of random DNA sequences for the ability to bind target molecules by a process termed SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment). Similar to antibodies, aptamers scan serve as: (i) affinity probes in quantitative immunoassays, (ii) contrast probes in whole-body imaging, (iii) drugs, and (iv) ""vehicles"" for drug delivery. Apatamers have so far been selected for significantly fewer targets and utilized in significantly fewer applications than antibodies. One of the reasons for this is the lack of efficient methods for aptamer selection. Such methods have been a research focus at my laboratory for the last 5 years. In the first stage of our research, we advanced methods for selection of pure-target aptamers by pioneering selection of ""smart"" aptamers (JACS 2005, 127, 3165; JACS 2005, 127, 11224) and non-SELEX selection of regular aptamers (JACS 2006, 128, 1410; Nature Protocols 2006, 1, 1359). Smart aptamers have made possible quantitative immunoassays with an ultra-wide dynamic range of target concentrations (JACS 2007, 129, 7260). Our current focus is the development of aptamers for targets on the cell surface and inside cells, as well as the use of such aptamers for studies in live cells and whole organisms. In our preliminary research, we demonstrated selection of highly-potent aptamer pools for targets on the surface of live cells (JACS 2008, 130, 9137) and in crude cell lysate (Nucleic Acids Res., 2009, 37, e62); we are now working on a method for selection of aptamers with targets inside cells. These methods create the foundation for highly-innovative aptamer-based biomedical technologies for: (i) the study of single cells, (ii) biomarker discovery, (iii) cell sorting, (iv) diagnosis of metastases, etc. The development of aptamers for cellular targets and their further use in the above five directions is impossible without a flow cytometer. This application requests funds for purchasing a flow cytometer to support our research on aptamers for cellular targets.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge",Chemistry,"Krylov, Sergey","EQPEQ ","Bioanalytical chemistry","Analytical chemistry","Chimie analytique",1-1
"Conventional anti-cancer therapies target a common feature of cancer cells - their ability to divide. Conventional therapies equally kill cancer and normal dividing cells; moreover, they are only 5-6 times less cytotoxic to normal non-dividing cells. As a result, conventional therapies have debilitating side effects (e.g. severe indigestion, hair loss, and cytopenias) and the dose required to eradicate tumors often exceeds the lethal dose. In the last two decades, a significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular bases of cancer. Many abnormal proteins, which initiate and drive the disease, have been identified and can now be usec as therapeutic targets for so-called mechanism-based therapies. Simply speaking, mechanism-based drugs kill only cells in which the therapeutic target is active leaving all other cells intact. The ratio between the therapeutic dose and lethal dose can be greater than one hundred, making mechanism-based therapies very safe There is a downside, however: the efficacy of any given mechanism-based therapy is lower than those of conventional therapies. Malignant tumors are highly heterogeneous; they consist of clones (subpopulations) of cells with different abnormal proteins. Some of these clones are likely to be resistant to a highly specific therapy that targets only one protein. To cure cancer, the resistant clones have to be identified along with their therapeutic targets and another therapy has to be used to eliminate mem. Thus, the efficient use of mechanism-based therapies requires two diagnostic procedures: (i) assessment of tumor heterogeneity with respect to the presence of multiple therapeutic targets and (ii) monitoring the heterogeneity of tumor response to the therapy at the molecular level. A technology for carrying out these procedures is analytically challenging and currently unavailable. Here we propose to develop a technology termed aptamer-mediated analysis of proteins in individual cells (AMAPIC), which will facilitate the efficient use of mechanism-based anti-cancer therapies.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Health, education and social services",Chemistry,"Krylov, Sergey","STPGP ","Bioanalytical chemistry","Analytical chemistry","Chimie analytique",3-3

"The objective of my research is to develop the mathematical models and theory for financial applications and to apply the results to financial markets. The topics include pricing and hedging derivative securities, measures of risk, and risk management.



Measurement and management of financial risks are important topics in mathematical finance. I work on problems related to a ""coherent risk measure"". It is known that a coherent risk measure is described by a set of probability measures, in the sense that the future value is acceptable if and only if every expected value under probability measures in the set are nonnegative. When there is the possibility of dynamic trading or the evolution of available information, the need for multi-period risk measurement arises. This topic has been treated in the papers (with Artzner, Delbaen, Eber and Heath). Risk measures are widely applied to finance theory.



I also work on pricing and hedging of complicated derivative securities. Since Black-Scholes formula provided a theoretical method of pricing and hedging derivatives, the mathematical theory has permitted the creation and pricing of numerous derivatives. In reality, a market is ""incomplete"". Pricing and hedging in such incomplete markets become more complex. The proposed research will provide financial institutions (such as banks) with the theoretical backgrounds and help them design specialized derivatives, find a ""fair"" price, and manage their risks.

"APPORTIONMENT METHODS FOR FAIR RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND SEQUENCING. The apportionment problem consists in apportioning seats among states in proportion to their populations. The ideal can hardly be met due to indivisible nature of representatives. The theory of apportionment's main insights come from axioms necessary to ensure paradox-free solutions. The apportionment methods are proposed to complement operations research methods for: balancing workloads in mixed-model supply chains, fair queueing, hard-real time and proportional scheduling. Their characteristics are studied for consistency with properties, e.g. periodicity and symmetry, desirable for man-made systems (supply chains, operating systems). We anticipate this axiomatic method to evolve into a more general approach that could supplement optimization approach to resource allocation problems. We also anticipate the apportionment methods to provide novel solutions to resource sharing and scheduling problems and interesting insights into them. PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY CHAIN SMOOTHING. The reduction of variability in all forms makes just-in-time supply chains for mixed-models tick. The production and delivery smoothing problem has been studied for synchronized assembly lines. However, many manufacturing systems with processing and setup times varying among models are not synchronized assembly lines.  We propose a solution that batches units of the same model and uses just-in-time sequencing methods to smooth production and delivery for such systems. The batching and scheduling is based on Pareto optimization and apportionment methods. Desirable characteristics of  solutions to improve management of operations are studied. UNIVERSITY

TIMETABLING. The university timetabling distinctive feature is that classes are grouped for lectures. The problem is NP-hard. We propose an LP relaxation and a rounding procedure to obtain approximate solutions with a constant absolute error for this timetabling problem. We study the cases for which optimal rounding can be found in polynomial time. These results apply to preemptive open shops and hyper-graph coloring.

"Rising levels of atmospheric carbon-dioxide (CO2) since the industrial revolution have been linked to the climate warming of the last century.  Temperature is one of the abiotic factors that severely impacts photosynthesis, the process by which plants harvest sunlight and use it to fix CO2 into carbohydrates.  We have a good theoretical understanding of what limits photosynthesis at or below its optimum temperature in most cases, but there is considerable scientific debate about why photosynthesis declines in response to warm but non-lethal temperatures, and how plants adjust photosynthesis to different growth temperatures.  The research proposed here will explore these questions using a variety of experimental approaches.  The research program will also directly investigate the function of Rubisco, the enzyme that actually fixes CO2.  Rubisco is the most abundant enzyme on Earth, but it is slow and inefficient in comparison to other enzymes.  Moreover, its efficiency declines with increasing temperature.  I will continue to characterize the biochemistry and structure of this enzyme, to better understand its performance, how it evolved, and how it responds to temperature.  Understanding the response of photosynthesis to variation in atmospheric CO2 and temperature is a vital component of predicting the response of natural plant communities and agricultural species to global change.

"The Rho-family of proteins play crucial regulatory roles in biology by controlling the size, shape and movements of a large number of living cells.  Inappropriate activity of this family of proteins is known to lead to human diseases and they play a fundamental role in cell biology.  Although we have a good understanding of some simple functions of these proteins, some things we do not know are (i) how are they regulated, (ii) once they are switched on, what other proteins do they bind and (iii) how are these other proteins affected to carry out their biological functions.



We propose to investigate these fundamental issues in cell biology by using C.elegans as a model organism.  The ""worm"" has proven to be very useful for developmental and genetic studies because it is easy to grow, it is small enough for characterization of every individual cell in the organism (@1000 total cells) and we can manipulate it by safely adding modified genes.



One particular Rho-family member, CDC-42, will be explored.  We propose to use a relatively new technique called proteomics.  In this context, we will use proteomics (which involves using highly sensitive mass spectrometry) to identify proteins that physically interact with CDC-42.  We will also explore CDC-42 function by removing its gene in nematodes and by overexpressing a hyper-activated mutated form of the protein, to determine what affect altering CDC-42 levels and activity has on the ability of the worm to move.  Mutants that cause a decrease in movement can then eventually be used as a basis of a screen where we try to ""rescue"" these mutants by creating a second mutation in the worm genome.  To rescue, these second mutations should be within the signalling pathway of CDC-42 function and they can be identified.  Both techniques will allow us to identify important partners to CDC-42 and help us to understand the mechanism of CDC-42 action.

The project is oriented towards the development of potato extracts for use as novel nutraceutical agents by combining extracts of cultivars of potatoes that our research team has identified to contain high levels of bioactive polyphenols shown to exert potent antioxidant, blood glucose lowering, hypolipidemic properties. Chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and rutin are the polyphenolic compounds present in high amounts in certain potato cultivars. Potato cultivars will be tested under different storage and harvest conditions to determine the optimal conditions to produce higher amounts of these polyphenols. Microwave processing will be utilized to optimize the polyphenolic extraction. Extracts of high polyphenolic-cultivars will be combined to produce an optimal profile of polyphenolic compounds to test in a diabetic mouse model for their hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties. These extracts will be compared in a dose related fashion for beneficial outcomes in comparison to a standard synthetic chlorogenic test diet, previously demonstrated to show potent health benefits in the mouse diabetic model. Potato extracts containing  optimal amounts of bioactive phytochemicals could have promising value for the development of phytomedicine for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Health, education and social services","Dietetics and Human Nutrition, School of","Kubow, Stan","STPGP ",Nutrition,"Life sciences research related to human health and disease","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines",2-3
"The applicant is exploring the role of molecules (oxysterols, ceramides) that may be modulated by dietary antioxidants such as selenium (Se) to: (1) lower blood lipid levels; and (2) protect against embryonic maldevelopment related to environmental neurotoxins such as methylmercury. The proposed hypothesis is that Se-mediated induction of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARa) pathway is a common mechanism of protective action of Se against diet-induced hyperlipidemia as well as neurotoxicity caused by dietary environmental toxins such as methylmercury and PCBs. In particular, the applicant suggests that activation of PPARa by Se will favorably modulate oxidative stress, and tissue concentrations of oxysterols and ceramide. Oxysterols and ceramide, which are modulated by the PPAR pathway, have been indicated to play important roles in cholesterol metabolism, diet-induced hyperlipidemia as well as neurotoxicity. Our Se supplementation hamster trials have shown potent blood cholesterol lowering effects, which we related to induction of enzymatically generated oxysterols and altered tissue expression of key hepatic and intestinal cholesterol transporters. The link between PPARa, oxysterols, ceramides in relation to Se intake would establish new avenues of investigation regarding the relationship between Se and cardiovascular disease. For the assessment of neurotoxicity of methylmercury and PCBs, we developed a rat embryo model that allows for the study of neurotoxic effects at the later embryonic stages of gestational days 13.5 -14, which cannot be carried out with traditional  embryo culture. Our embryo culture studies show that antioxidants such as Se at physiological cord blood levels inhibit adverse neurochemical alterations induced by methyl mercury and PCBs at higher levels that can be seen in maternal cord blood. Since the PPAR pathway can modulate neurochemical levels in developing CNS and protects against oxidative stress, the clarification of the involvement of PPARa, ceramides and oxysterols will provide possible mechanisms of environmental embryonic neurotoxicity and the protective effects of dietary antioxidants.

"Accurate assessment and cost-effective remediation of contaminated groundwater is essential to ensure the sustainable development of water supplies in Canada where approximately 8 million people rely on groundwater as their primary source of drinking water. This proposal targets an area of national priority - environment and sustainable development - with an emphasis on renewable resources management. The specific class of groundwater contaminants addressed is polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a group of 209 separate organic congeners. Despite the fact that PCBs are no longer manufactured, they are persistent and present throughout Canada's environment because of their high resistance to degradation. The majority of PCB mass in the environment resides in the subsurface in the form of dense, non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). The proposed research will investigate PCB transport in both unconsolidated overburden deposits and fractured bedrock using both numerical simulation and laboratory experimentation. The work will be carried out in unprecedented detail in that the problem will be addressed by examining both emulsion transport and migration of individual congeners in groundwater, as opposed to the traditional approach of addressing total PCBs in the aqueous phase. The resulting knowledge and the 3D numerical models that will be developed can be used by the Canadian environmental industry to further assess, select, and design remedial techniques for PCB-impacted sites.  The knowledge can also be used to perform risk assessments and to assess the contribution of PCBs in groundwater to the broader hydrologic cycle. It is expected that the results of this work will have a positive affect on Canada's environmental industry within 3 years.  Long term, the results of this research will allow practitioners to diagnose sites impacted by a variety of multicomponent compounds, not just PCBs. Research will be carried out by graduate students in a group that has 16 years experience conducting numerical simulation and laboratory experimentation with organic compounds in groundwater systems.

"Valuation theory is the study of algebraic structures (like fields) via a valuation map, which assigns certain invariants (like value groups and residue fields) of a lesser complexity to the structure. Basic examples for valuations are the p-adic valuations (which play an important role in number theory) and the zero or pole order obtained for rational functions by evaluating them at a fixed place (this is, or should be, high school mathematics). Valuation theory has witnessed important applications in number theory, algebraic geometry, model theory and several other branches of mathematics.

Local uniformization is a prerequisite for the resolution of singularities of algebraic varieties. Resolution in positive characteristic is one of the most prominent open problems in contemporary mathematics. Local uniformization was proved by Zariski in characteristic 0, and by Abhyankar for surfaces in positive characteristic. The general case in positive characteristic is open.

When valuations are studied from the point of view of mathematical logic, one has the same phenomenon: while the case of characteristic 0 is well-known, in positive characteristic the general case is open (and has turned out to be a very hard problem).

The reason in both cases is a nasty valuation theoretical effect which only appears in positive characteristic. Its very descriptive name is: ``the defect''. In the past, several excellent mathematicians have surrendered to the very hard problems connected with it. It is the main goal of my work to tame the defect and to achieve solutions to the above problems. I am building on some pioneering work which I did in my doctoral thesis.

But also in characteristic 0, I am developing new valuation theoretical methods, which can be used to study basic mathematical concepts like differentiation, the exponential function, and the asymptotic behavior of functions.

"Particle entrainment into the gas stream from stationary and moving particle beds is important in a number of industrial and physical environments. It has particlular relavance in rotary kilns, aeolian saltation and hydrological applications were there are strong flow rates adjacent to the surface. Specifically, in rotary kilns where the process material normally rotates as a bed with a highly turbulent flow normal to the rotation, dusting can lead to recycle of 30% of the process material. This recycled material not only reduces process efficiency but also leads to a significant energy cost as the materials is cooled then reheated. The objectives of the proposed research are to characterize and model particle entrainment from inclined stationary and moving particle beds in confined turbulent flows and particle distribution adjacent to rough wall in converging and diverging geometries. This research has the potential to significantly improve process efficiency and to reduce overall energy consumption in particle transport processes.","Mineral resources ( prospecting, exploration, mining, extraction, processing)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering","Kuhn, David","RGPIN ","Multi-phase systems","Fluid mechanics","M�canique des fluides",2-5

"The proposed research program is in the area known as Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). The devices studied are very flat and thin (only two micrometers) and they are smaller than one square millimeter; the mechanisms' features are measured in micrometers.

The objects of the research are microparticles suspended in liquids and the goal is to manipulate and mechanically test them. The manipulation of particles suspended in liquids includes, transportation, stream forming, stream separation, sorting, changing direction of transport, and collection in one place. The manipulation is executed by oscillating electric fields produced by submerged arrays of electrodes. The mechanical testing includes: pulling apart, squeezing, bursting, shearing and measuring deformation and forces. The testing is performed by mechanical gripping devices equipped with jaws.

The idea is to apply the developed devices in such fields as food, brewing, and pharmaceutical industries and research in palaeoecology, archaeology, and food science. The envisioned applications will dramatically increase existing testing efficiencies in these areas. In particular testing such particles as:

-  Yeast cells used in brewing and food industry; where the mechanical properties of yeast cells is used to monitor the effectiveness of beer and bread production.

-  Micro capsules from gelatin containing droplets of liquids used in food and pharmaceutical industry; where the mechanical properties of the gelatin micro capsules are directly related to the protection of the encapsulated active compounds.

-  Phytoliths i.e. plant silica bodies that are collected from soils and researched in palaeoecology, archaeology and food science. Phytoliths, the silica deposits in plant cells, are tiny, mineralized, three-dimensional, solid copies of the cell bodies.

"This grant provides funding for a motion capture system at the University of Waterloo to enable experiments and analysis of human movements in multiple research programs in biomechanics, robotics, and rehabilitation engineering. Analysis of human movement will lead to improved understanding of the mechanisms for human balance and other human movements. Measurements of human motion are also vital for developing and evaluating technologies for assistive devices, rehabilitation and sports training. Understanding human motion is also valuable in robotics applications, where knowledge of human movement can be used by the robot to imitate and achieve new behaviours, anticipate human motion and improve safety.

The motion capture system consists of 8 high speed cameras, which are used to track reflective markers placed on key locations on the human body as a human subject moves around the workspace. The system allows the position and velocity of each part of the human body to be measured accurately during movement, allowing data to be collected  for a wide variety of human motions and activities, including walking and running, everyday movements performed in home settings, movements performed during work activities, such as assembly tasks in manufacturing, as well as sports training and rehabilitation exercises.

The system is also capable of online measurements, providing accurate human position data in real-time. This will allow experiments with direct human-robot interaction, where the robot learns and imitates movements as they are performed by the human demonstrator, and anticipates known movements by the demonstrator. For example, a worker could use the system to train the robot to perform a manufacturing assembly task simply by demonstrating the task to the robot. The system would also allow a human operator to control a robot as the robot carries out a task. This would be useful for remote robot control (teleoperation), where the human operator's hand and arm motions are tracked by the cameras at the motion capture studio, and the task is simultaneously performed by the robot in a remote hazardous environment.

"CD44 is a adhesion molecule present on most cell types and is responsible for binding to hyaluronic acid present in the connective tissue. Therefore, CD44 mediates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and plays an important role in cell migration during inflammation and cancer development. Most cells express CD44 but can bind HA. Certain inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharides can cause modification in the structure of CD44 so that it can bind HA and increase their cell adhesion. Adhesion of CD44 with HA can also cause the production of certain molecules /growth factors, also called proinflammatory cytokines, which are responsible for causing inflammation. Therefore, binding of monocytes with T cells through CD44-HA interactions is a key pro-inflammatory event, and the upregulation of the ability of monocytes to bind HA is a key event in their participation in inflammatory responses. The results from our laboratory and others suggest that endotoxins (LPS), and several pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a induce the expression of CD44 and generation of an adhesive phenotype in human monocytes. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis for the switch from a non-adhesive to adhesive phenotype has important biological consequences and merit investigation of this phenomenon. Therefore, the overall aim of this research proposal is to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of CD44 expression and generation of an adhesive CD44 phenotype. Specifically, we will study the role of intracellular signaling molecules such as PI3 kinase amd MAP kinases in the regulation of CD44 expression and generation of adhesive CD44 phenotype in monocytic cells following stimulation with TNF-alpha and LPS.  This will be accomplished by investigating the expression of second messengers including the MAP and tyrosine kinases and the induction of various transcription factors and DNA binding proteins such as egr-1 and AP-1.","Medical and health sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Pathology and Laboratory Medicine","Kumar, Ashok","RGPIN ","Cell movement","Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",3-5
"The requested real time RT-PCR will allow us to perform gene expression studies in bacteria, nematodes, plants, and mammalian cell lines. This equipment is essential for the research of six different research programs, and will also serve as a valuable tool for other research groups at the university. 

The Kumar group is investigating mechanisms that regulate the expression of Resistance-Nodulation-cell Division (RND) family efflux pumps in Acinetobacter baumannii.  Analyzing expression of RND operons in different A. baumannii isolates will provide valuable information on how these organisms survive in toxic environments aid in designing new drug therapy against this organism. The Forrester laboratory will use the real time RT-PCR to determine the level of expression of Ligand-Gated Chloride Channels (LGCC) genes in different developmental stages of the parasitic nematodes with a long-term objective of developing anti-helminthics. The Bonetta laboratory will utilize the requested equipment to identify mechanisms important for cell wall synthesis by using a genetic approach in model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A real time RT-PCR will allow detection of genes that are expressed at low levels. The Strap group will use real time RT-PCR equipment to monitor and compare gene expression of extracellular metabolites produced by bacteria in natural and laboratory conditions. Use of the real time RT-PCR instrument by the Desaulniers group will allow for monitoring of the effect of siRNA molecules on the expression of a variety of genes. The Green-Johnson group will use the real time RT-PCR to examine the ability of functional food components to influence the expression of genes encoding cytokines, key cell surface molecules, and eicosanoids.

"Recently microsatellites (10 kg~100 kg) and nanosatellites (1 kg~10 kg) have experienced rapid growth due to development on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and nano technologies. However, their scientific and commercial applications involve several challenging problems including significant bias instability errors of MEMS sensors, low attitude performance provided by magnetic torquers,  nanowheels or control moment gyros (CMGs) still under developmental stage, and unavailability of fault tolerant attitude control for a single satellite and multiple satellites during formation flying. The proposed research will examine these challenging problems during three years of the project with a focus of three objectives:   1) design of nanowheels and CMGs (year 1), 2) controller design (year 2), and 3) fault tolerant and intelligent attitude control (year 3). The first objective will involve mathematical modeling and optimal design for mass, power, and available torque, and computer simulation and laboratory testing.  The second objective will deals with controller design for a single satellite, and multiple satellites during formation maintenance and reconfiguration. The final objective will involve the development fault tolerant and intelligent attitude control for satellites including underactuated satellites in the presence of environmental perturbations (gravity gradient, aerodynamic forces, Earth magnetic forces, solar radiation pressure, etc.).  Finally, it is planned that the attitude control system developed will be applied to JC2Sat (Japan Canada Joint Collaboration Satellites), a joint project between Canadian Space Agency and Japanese Space Agency, and will be flight tested on satellites designed by SpaceQuest Canada Inc.",Aerospace,"Transportation systems and services","Aerospace Engineering","Kumar, Krishna","CRDPJ ","Aerospace, aeronautical and automotive engineering","Mechanical engineering","G�nie m�canique",3-3
"The overall objective of the proposed research is to examine the feasibility of low cost, innovative and intelligent control methods requiring minimum power or propellant for attitude control and/or autonomous formation maintenance. In order to investigate these issues and foster the development of novel and innovative technologies, the proposed research will focus on two primary objectives: attitude dynamics and control, and formation dynamics and control. The first objective of the research is to examine issues encountered in attitude dynamics and control systems. Several low cost methods will to be studied. These include controls based on environmental forces (i.e., solar radiation pressure, aerodynamic force, magnetic force, and gravity force) and combinations of these forces. Dr. Kumar's previous work in these areas, including the application of tethers and fluid rings for attitude control, will be extended. In the next objective, Dr. Kumar's research on formation control methods based on thrusters and environmental forces will be further developed and applied to formation keeping and reconfiguration. This research will also include coupled attitude and formation dynamics and control.  The applicant's research on robust and intelligent formation control strategies, based on linear and nonlinear controllers will be extended and applied to both the objectives. The feasibility of the proposed methods will finally be tested via computer simulation and ground test. 



Dr. Kumar anticipates that the outcome of this research program will lead to the development of innovative technologies for attitude and formation control of satellites. In addition, the proposed research will significantly contribute to the training of researchers and scholars in leading-edge technologies to meet the needs of the Canadian space and high-technology sectors.

"Result replicability is considered fundamental in scientific research methodology. Statistical significance does not evaluate result replicability.  The p-value as a measure of significance dominates statistical analysis and decision making however it surprisingly tells little about replicability. It is not uncommon to observe that in one simulation of small number of repeats of a typical experiment, p-value can vary over a large interval. Thus illustrating that p-value is a very unreliable measure. Both external and internal replicability analyses are important. True external replication studies are many times impractical, and therefore researchers turn to internal methods like cross-validation, the jackknife and the bootstrap. Recently copula functions have emerged as an appropriate measure of dependence among random variables and provide an alternative model to the commonly practised correlation based models for studying the dependence.   

                          This research will help researchers and practitioners both to understand problems associated with the p-value as a measure of statistical significance and problems in using correlation based prediction modelling.  Further, it will discuss appropriate alternative significance and dependence measures and models as a remedy. By analysing climatic behaviour of two principal observables, temperature and precipitation, I anticipate that my research will provide methodology leading to better climatic variable prediction models.

"Natural Killer (NK) cells are a small population of white blood cells that provide us a first line of defense against many types of microorganisms, viruses, and abnormal tumor cells.  Activation of NK cell functions is controlled by a balance of signaling through simultaneous engagement of two groups of NK receptors (activation and inhibitory receptors) on the cell surface. There exists a multiple-step, developmental process that turns bone marrow stem cells into these specialized NK cells.  Importantly, NK cells are educated to distinguish self and non-self cells during development.  The latter is important in preventing mature NK cells from attacking self-tissues.  The factors and the underlying mechanism involved in this developmental process remain largely unclear.  This is in part due to difficulty in genetically engineering primary NK cells, and lack of experimental systems that allow us to characterize a protein's function in specific NK maturation states. 

     We demonstrated recently the successful stable transduction of genetic materials into primary mature NK cells (resting and cytokine-activated) and NK progenitors in vitro. In this 5-year proposal, we use this established method to manipulate the balance of NK receptor signaling in these cell types, using an inhibitory receptor I identified and a signal transducer that is central to NK inhibitory receptor signaling in fully mature NK cells.  These engineered cells will be used to test our hypothesis that balance of receptor signaling is also pivotal on NK differentiation, and/or acquisition of target recognition specificities.  The same receptor signaling may have different functional outcomes in different maturation states of NK cells.  Findings to be obtained in this study and the continued development of platforms to perform ""gain-of-function"" or ""loss-of-function"" experiments in primary NK cells and precursors in vitro and in vivo will advance our understanding of the factors that govern the basic biology of NK cell development and target recognition.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge",Immunology,"Kung, Sam","RGPIN ",Immunology,Microbiology,Microbiologie,2-5
"    )	In this application, we request funds to purchase an automated gas chromatography system, capable of carrying out fast and reproducible quantitative analyses of lipids.  Our research programs focus on plant lipid metabolism and its regulation, with the goals of manipulating cuticular wax and seed oil compositions in commercial crops. Our studies utilize mutants and large numbers of transgenic plants with altered lipid profiles.  Since lipid compositional changes can only be accurately determined by gas chromatography, the requested instrument is essential to us for evaluations of such mutants and genetically engineered plants.  Until now we have been using an old instrument purchased by Dr. Beverley Green in the Department of Botany in 1985 for routine analysis. However, this gas chromatograph and the autosampler required for high throughput sample analyses have now broken down and are not possible to repair because the manufacturer no longer supports this older model. In the past six months, we have been relying heavily on a high-end analytical GC-MS instrument located in the Jetter lab in our department. Due to the heavy use of this instrument by the lab residents, and its analytical focus on identification of unknown compounds, rather than routine detection of varying amounts of known compounds, this gas chromatograph is not appropriate for our needs.  Our trainees, as well as our research programs, face serious delays in research progress and productivity. The requested instrument will alleviate these problems, and provide an invaluable resource required not only for our labs, but also other members of our Department.

"Cuticular wax covers surfaces of land plants and serves as a protective barrier against water loss, UV-light, pathogens and insects. Major wax components are derived from saturated very long chain fatty acids (> C26 in length) via two wax biosynthetic pathways: an acyl reduction pathway and a decarbonylation pathway. Similar compositions of wax constituents comprising cuticular wax of Arabidopsis and other plant species suggest that these pathways are highly conserved in the plant kingdom. However, our knowledge of the wax biosynthetic enzymes, the nature of the biochemical reactions that they catalyze and their localization within the cell is limited. 

          The long-term goal of my research program is to understand the biochemistry and molecular biology of wax biosynthesis and its regulation, and mechanism(s) involved in the transport of wax to the plant surface. We are using wax-deficient eceriferum (cer) mutants of Arabidopsis to identify and functionally characterize proteins involved in these processes. In this application, we propose to focus on CER19 and CER22 genes, because wax compositions of cer19 and cer22 mutants suggest that they encode proteins involved in the formation of hydrocarbons, the last fundamental part of wax biosynthesis that remains to be elucidated. In addition, our recent work on the cer7 mutant resulted in the discovery of the CER7 ribonuclease involved in regulation of cuticular wax biosynthesis. We plan to identify the mRNA targets of the CER7 enzyme and investigate their roles in the CER7-mediated control of wax production.

          The research proposed here will enhance our overall understanding of the wax biosynthetic machinery and result in the identification of genes essential for controlled genetic engineering of wax composition and accumulation to improve tolerance of crop plants to drought, and their resistance to pathogens and insects.  Furthermore, the knowledge of the enzymology of hydrocarbon formation will lay the basis for the production of renewable high-efficiency biofuels that can replace fossil fuels which are currently escalating in price.

"The quest for a theory that unifies gravity with quantum mechanics is one of the most important in theoretical physics today. Despite substantial progress in string theory and loop quantum gravity, much remains to be understood and the thermodynamic properties of black holes seem to provide valuable clues. One of the most striking properties of black hole thermodynamics is its apparent universality: it has the same qualitative features for all black holes, irrespective of which theory of gravity or which underlying microscopic theory one considers. It is this universal nature that motivates my study of the classical and quantum mechanics of generic black holes using a class of theories known collectively as two dimensional dilaton gravity.  These theories live in one spatial dimension, and are sufficiently simple to be tractable but also sufficiently complex to provide insight into the microscopic origins of black hole thermodynamics. One of the projects I will undertake is a study of the quantum dynamics of black hole formation in this general context.

   A related research area is quantum computation and information theory. Quantum computers can in principle solve problems that require an exponentially large amount of resources using traditional computers. In addition, they give rise to fundamental questions about the nature of quantum information that may have application to other fields of physics, most notably quantum gravity and black hole physics. My collaborators and I have recently shown that isolated quantum systems can suffer decoherence due to quantum anomalies. This is a form of instability that arises due to the internal structure of the system under consideration. Quantum anomalies often suggest the presence of hidden degrees of freedom and can render certain systems unsuitable as components for quantum computers. More importantly, we are exploring the exciting possibility that decoherence due to quantum anomalies may help to reveal the nature of the microscopic internal degrees of  freedom that account for the thermodynamic properties of black holes.

"Wireless mesh networks are a new, disruptive technology to provide high-speed last-mile access to rural and urban users. Toronto Hydro, for example, announced that they will build Canada's largest WiFi mesh to provide low-cost Internet access to Toronto residents. While the core building blocks of such networks (radio transmitters and basic networking protocols) exist, many problems remain. In the past few years, my group has worked on a range of multi-hop wireless network topics. In conjunction with a small Ottawa startup company, we built one of the few wireless mesh testbeds in Canada. In the proposed research, we will build on this basis to address one of the core challenges: providing end-users with fair and high-bandwidth (i.e., high throughput) access to the wireless mesh and through it to the Internet.

1) Throughput: wireless links are typically bandwidth-constrained and subject to interference. Most MAC and routing protocols fail to completely utilize the network resources, resulting in lower than possible aggregate end-to-end throughput. A few analytical models exist to determine the maximally achievable throughput rates, but cannot be applied directly due to their centralized nature and high computational complexity. We will develop approximations to such models and use them to derive distributed protocols that implement the key ideas to maximize end-to-end throughput.

2) Fairness: users should achieve their ""fair"" share of network resources when accessing the mesh. Yet using current protocols, bandwidth sharing is very uneven and location-dependent, with users closer to the fixed infrastructure and with connections with lower RTT getting better service from the network. 

The two topics are intrinsically linked: ensuring fairness will come at an aggregate throughput penalty. We will explore these topics using analytical model, simulation studies, and through implementation in our testbed. The goal is to develop better network protocols from the MAC to the transport layer and to evaluate them through simulation and in our testbed.

"The intestine is filled with microorganisms (commensals) that have mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with their host. Commensals are involved in maintaining the integrity of the cells lining the gut surface, aiding in absorption of foodstuffs, and conditioning the immune system. Some commensal organisms, when ingested (probiotics) provide nutrients, facilitate normal intestinal motility, and may also reduce inflammation in the host if present. It is becoming evident that the interaction between these microorganisms and their hosts is more complex than previously thought and evidence is being accumulated that some commensals can affect directly the host nervous system. For example certain specific probiotic species alter autonomic nerve reflexes, the activity of nerve fibres connecting the intestine with the central nervous system. Probiotics may even alter brain activity including mood and anxiety. How the commensal signal directly to the nervous system has been a mystery. We have now found the 1st evidence that a particular species of acid producing Lactobacillus probiotic can target the activity of an ion channel molecule in a single type of intestinal sensory nerve cell. This surprising discovery provides a significant lead to the understanding of how certain commensals could talk to a part of the host nervous system; a necessary 1st step in unraveling the paths of how commensals communicate with different parts of the nervous system. We have designed a series of physiological experiments that will uncover the routes and molecular chemical mechanisms by which the microorganism signals to those sensory nerve cells. The results from these experiments will provide the 1st detailed description for the steps involved into normal physiological signaling between the bacterial and animal Kingdom. This work will then be expanded to involve other microbe species and components of the host nervous system to determine how the commensal ecosystem interacts with the host nervous system to facilitate a homeostatic relationship between the bacteria and their hosts.

"Calcium is a major activator of the contractile machinery in the smooth muscle cells and its level inside the cell determines the amount of contraction generated by the cell.  Using physiologically intact animal blood vessels and airway, we are proposing to undertake an extensive survey of the pattern and the mechanism of calcium-dependent contraction in various smooth muscle cells.  More specifically, we want to further explore the mechanisms for wave-like calcium oscillations, an important and common signaling mechanism for activating smooth muscle contraction.  We are also planning to study the structures of the different vascular smooth muscle cells in order to understand why different smooth muscle cells behave differently. From the studies, we are hopeful to gain insight into how smooth muscle cells behave in different tissue and organ.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Northern Medical Program","Kuo, KuoHsing","RGPIN ","Cell biology","Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",3-5

"My research area is number theory.  It is a common phenomenon in mathematics that a number theoretical object can be associated with a complex function, in which important arithmetic data are encoded. For instance, the set of integers can be associated with the Riemann zeta function. In particular, the distribution of primes in integers can be associated with the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. My work on number theory is to study these functions. One area I work in is the study of non-vanishing results on a certain family of such complex functions. Another area I work in is elliptic curves. The study of elliptic curves is important in modern number theory. The famous Fermat theorem was proved in 1995 by extended studies on this subject. A conjecture made by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer predicts the deep connection between the arithmetic data of elliptic curves and the complex functions attached to elliptic curves. My results on these functions can help us better understand the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer.   



The other important subject in number theory is the ring of polynomials over a finite field, called a function field. It bears a close resemblance to the ring of integers. Many results about integers can be asked of these analogues. An analogue of elliptic curves for function fields is Drinfeld modules. I study Koblitz's conjecture and Artin's conjecture on Drinfeld modules. These two conjectures regard probabilistic properties of Drinfeld modules whose elliptic curve analogues have not been proved yet. My work on them sheds a light on the original conjectures on elliptic curves.

"Inwardly-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels are a class of protein named for the unique electrical property of inward rectification. This refers to the ability to allow potassium ions to flow preferentially into cells, rather than out of cells, and is caused by voltage-dependent block of these channels by a class of small organic molecules called polyamines, found in virtually all cells. When cells are at rest, Kir channels are open, and potassium ions flow freely. However, at membrane voltages where potassium is driven out of the cell, polyamines enter and block the Kir channel pore, preventing movement of potassium through the channel. This process is rapid and dynamic, occuring with every beat of the heart and every muscle contraction, and is vital to the appropriate function of many excitable cells. The proposed research will examine the fundamental details of polyamine-regulated inward rectification, identifying components of the channel that interact with the blocker, and mechanisms that underlie the voltage-dependence of interaction between polyamines and Kir channels. It is anticipated that the results of this research will enhance our understanding of basic mechanisms critical to cellular excitability, and will also offer new and general insights into principles of ion channel blockade.","Not available","Not available","Anesthesiology, Pharmacology & Therapeutics","Kurata, Harley","RGPIN ",Electrophysiology,"Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",1-5

"The long-term goal of my research program is to investigate interlimb coordination (i.e. the coordination of more than one limb) and neuromuscular function in movement efficiency and to develop better dynamic muscle models. This has applications in a number of different fields and occupational settings including industrial ergonomics and clinical biomechanics. The short-term objectives of my research are to examine the variety of factors that affect neuromuscular function using advanced techniques including surface EMG and dynamic force measures and to investigate the physiological factors influencing interlimb coordination.



One method to observe neuromuscular function is through the use of surface electrodes to record myoelectric signals (MES) from contracting muscles. The MES measures the result of the neural commands sent to the muscle and provides evidence of various factors including the neural mechanisms responsible for deficiencies and interactions between muscles (agonist, antagonist and synergist). Recently, advances in MES processing have resulted in new techniques, which are more robust. High-density electromyography (HD-EMG) allows the acquisition of significantly greater numbers of muscle channels and therefore greater information from the muscle as a whole. These new systems allow for the development of topographical (energy) maps, which can then be used to further study muscle activation patterns. This is particularly suited for those with limited muscle physiology due to injury or loss. Recent pilot work investigating muscle activity (using HD-EMG) of the forearm from a group of healthy adults as well as traumatic and congenital amputees has shown reliable muscle patterns can be detected for various movements using this technology and that the information obtained can be used for better multifunction control of myoelectric prosthetic devices. Further investigation of interlimb coordination with this new technology is warranted.

"Resistance in plants against pathogen attack can be complete (vertical or mainly monogenic) or partial (horizontal or mainly polygenic). The latter, because of quantitative inheritance and for lack of suitable tools to screen genotypes, is not well exploited by breeders for biotic stress management. However, the latest developments in metabolomics present a bright future. The mechanisms of true resistance are groped into structural or biochemical. Understanding of plant defense mechanisms at the molecular/metabolic level could lead to novel strategies to manage destructive crop diseases. Metabolomics is an evolving field of systems biology that can shed some light on the functions of genes, and furthermore, metabolites are often the end products of plant defense against stresses, thus it can also be used independently to screen for resistance. Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) we have identified more than 200 resistance related (RR) metabolites (higher abundance in resistant than in susceptible). However, GC/MS detects only volatiles and for non-volatile metabolites the use of high accurate mass liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is needed. The objective of the present study is to use LC/MS to better understand the mechanisms of resistance in wheat to fusarium head blight (FHB, Fusarium graminearum). In this study a wheat metabolome database will be established. The mechanisms of resistance to invasion will be investigated by metabolic profiling inoculated spikelets of resistant genotypes and multivariate analyses of their abundances to identify RR metabolites. The mechanisms of resistance to spread of pathogen within spike, through degradation of toxin (DON), will be investigated by metabolic profiling of resistant genotypes inoculated with pathogen strains producing and non-producing DON, and through containment of pathogen within rachis nodes based on metabolic profiles of rachis nodes at different growth stages. The knowledgebase generated here on the mechanisms of resistance in wheat to FHB, the biomarker RR metabolites identified, will be exploited to develop a high throughput metabolomics technology for screening wheat breeding lines for resistance to FHB.

"What does the future hold for the ecosystems and climate of Canada's North as a result of climate change?  Global warming has already started in Canada's boreal and Arctic regions, and is set to accelerate, but there is still a great deal of uncertainty about just how fast and in what way climate change will take place in the North.  For example, in the summer and fall of 2007, the amount and extent of Arctic sea ice shrank to record minimum values. No one forecast this disturbing event, and understanding why events like it occur and what else climate change will bring to the North are the aims of the research we propose to carry out in this project.  Climate forecasts come from ""all-inclusive"" computer models of climate with parts that capture the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean, the fall of rain and snow, the movement of water through soil and

rivers, and so on. The models are challenged when we ask for precise forecasts for a given region, especially in the North. Thus, it is critical to evaluate and improve the models to judge the credibility of forecasts of climate change impacts on Northern ecosystems and populations.  Our project focuses on a big part of the climate-change puzzle in the north: the cryosphere, which consists of the distribution and variation of ice and snow. To improve the reliability of Northern climate forecasts, we will tackle a set of problems involving parts of the cryosphere that climate models could capture in principle, but

for which the models have either not been properly evaluated or have been found to require improvement. We have targeted four ""subsystems"": snow, land/mountain ice, sea-ice, and the cryosphere-controlled Northern lakes. We will test the models against the best available observations, improve the models if possible, and assess the ecological implications of our findings. These findings will be synthesized for Environment Canada and Natural Resources Canada, to help them develop a science-based environmental policy for Canada's North.",Environment,"Northern development",Physics,"Kushner, Paul","STPGP ","Earth-systems science","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",1-3

"The Earth's atmosphere is an environment that we are constantly immersed in but that we understand in a surprisingly limited way. We experience the atmosphere's circulation directly when we are exposed to wind and precipitation; we experience it indirectly through satellite images that reveal our local weather as part of global-scale patterns; and we even experience it virtually through computer-generated weather forecasts. But does experiencing the atmospheric circulation in various ways mean that we understand it? Not really: even scientists who devote their lives to studying the atmosphere must come to terms with how difficult it is to understand fully. So an important long-term project is to develop a theory for the ""atmospheric general circulation"", which consists of the patterns of surface temperature and winds, the jet streams, and so on. Think of the atmosphere as a physical system controlled by inputs including the amounts of sunlight received at different places, the composition of the atmosphere and the land surface. Atmospheric science aims to develop a theory for the atmospheric general circulation that would help us understand this system and its past behaviour, and its predict its future response to natural and human-induced change.

    

In our research, we take advantage of powerful computer models of the atmosphere and climate to advance the theory of the atmospheric general circulation with carefully designed simulations. We will study the behaviour of planetary-scale patterns of circulation that control the daily weather, the links between the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) and the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), the role of snow in the atmospheric circulation, the controls on the decade-to-decade fluctuations in the circulation, and the coupling between the ocean and atmosphere of the Southern Hemisphere. Along the way, we will use observations to understand the results from models and theory. We hope that what we learn will shed light on the complexities of the general circulation and will help us predict its future.

"Over the last decade or so there has been an explosion of models and experiments demonstrating behaviors sensitive to noise, that is, stochastic variation:

  stochastic resonance in electronics and neural behavior, stabilization of behaviors that are considered to be transient, and  noise-driven synchronization/clustering in biological and mechanical applications, to name a few. Strongly related to such noise-driven phenomena are underlying transients + metastable states. These phenomena appear in a broad range of applications including  neural dynamics, the spread of disease, mechanical  systems, and climate dynamics, but the critical mechanisms driving these phenomena are rarely clearly identified.



One major challenge that appears in all of these applications is finding effective models to

analyze and predict  observed behavior in these systems. This goal means that uncertainty 

and randomness must be included in the model, and that one must understand how the

noise influences the output of the model.

 Some of our recent work points to the fundamental role of variation on both fast and slow time scales in both space and time, the underlying stability structure governing the dynamics we would expect to see over a  long time,  and balance between noise and feedback effects.  By understanding the basic features responsible for these phenomena, one can predict the occurence of stochastic sensitivity and in cases where input can be tuned, the stochastic behavior can be controlled. The proposal covers a variety of noise-driven phenomenon, with the goals of understanding their dependence on the interplay between nonlinear dynamics, transient and metastable states, and random variations, and providing better comparisons with experiments and data.

"The study of symmetries arises in almost all areas of mathematics, and in particular in geometry. In the mathematical language, symmetries usually are described by means of a group acting on an object. As an elementary example one could consider the group of Euclidean motions on the plane, generated by rotations and translations. One can generalize this picture to study the action of Lie groups or (as in the case of this proposal) algebraic groups on vector spaces (like the plane) or more complicated geometric objects. Symmetry groups arise in numerous natural sciences, be it physics (e.g. quantum or classical mechanics), or chemistry (e.g. the symmetries of crystals), or biology (e.g. the symmetries of protein structures). 

Symmetries, however, also play a very important role in mathematics itself. The topic of this proposal falls into the realms of algebraic geometry. One could argue that the most fundamental object in algebraic geometry is projective space (e.g. the set of lines through the origin in a plane). It is homogeneous, i.e. it looks everywhere the same, because for any two points there is a symmetry of projective space moving one point to the other (much like any point on a sphere may be rotated to any other point on the same sphere). It is possible to generalize this notion and obtain a large class of algebraic varieties, the so called projective homogeneous spaces. These spaces are tightly connected to the algebraic group used to define them, and the group acts as symmetries on these spaces.

Understanding (the geometry of) these spaces provides insight into the structure of these groups, and is connected to e.g. their representation theory among other things, an important subject with a wide array of applications. Using these spaces as model spaces, hopefully this also leads to a better understanding of other algebraic geometric objects. In this proposed project we try to understand the geometry of certain subsets (called Schubert varieties) of these spaces which arise naturally and can be shown to be fundamental for understanding these homogeneous spaces.

"The long-term goal of this research is the automatic construction of geometric representations that accurately capture the three-dimensional shape and appearance of real, highly-complex scenes in the physical world---objects, indoor/outdoor environments, and people. Toward this end, the proposed work aims to push forward the state of the art in the field of ""3D photography"" by tackling, among others, two classes of everyday scenes for which no general (or practical) 3D photography methods exist: (1) objects made of transparent, refractive, or highly-reflective media, such as glass or metal, that cause complex light propagation; and (2) natural scenes with high geometric complexity, such as hair, fur and dense foliage.



The scenes under investigation require new approaches to 3D photography and pose challenges both at a fundamental theoretical level (modeling image formation, solving inverse problems, establishing reconstructibility conditions) and at a practical level (efficient acquisition techniques, robust algorithms). To attack them, the PI will pursue two general directions recently developed within his research group: (1) design and analysis of Light-Path Triangulation algorithms for reconstructing specular scenes, and (2) design of high-resolution 3D photography algorithms that rely on control of a digital camera's focus and/or aperture.



This research will establish a theoretical foundation and a computational framework for designing 3D computer vision algorithms able to operate in a wider range of scenes than is currently possible. Moreover, tools and insights gained through this work are likely to lead to applications that impact photography enthusiasts at large (e.g., producing high-quality photos by controlling the aperture of a single-lens reflex camera).

"Rapid, unprecedented, and ongoing directional climate change, together with other anthropogenic perturbations, are radically altering northern ecosystems. Widespread caribou population declines across the North American Arctic may be an early indicator of the biological consequences of these stressors. Recent surveys indicate population declines of 40 to 80% in four herds in the Northwest Territories over the last decade (Gov. NWT unpubl. data). Infectious disease, in particular subclinical disease associated with parasitism, may play an important role in these declines. Parasites have negative effects on host condition, reproduction, and susceptibility to predation, and their transmission is closely linked to climatic conditions. Warming climatic conditions can shift patterns of parasite transmission and influence the infection pressure for caribou. This research investigates the abomasal (4th stomach) nematode Ostertagia gruehneri, in barrenground caribou. This parasite is shed in high numbers on the calving grounds. However, during 'normal' summers, caribou may move away from these highly contaminated area before infective larvae have developed, and this would limit parasite transmission. Small increases in temperatures could result in more rapid larval development, and massive exposure of caribou, including na�ve calves, to infective larvae before they leave the calving grounds, shifting the temporal patterns of disease. Ultimately this could lead to increased occurrence of disease in caribou. Through field and laboratory experiments together with work on captive reindeer and examination of naturally infected caribou, we will determine (1) the patterns of disease associated with O. gruehneri in barrenground caribou, and (2) the current patterns of parasite transmission for O. gruehneri. We will then construct models to predict the impacts of climate change on parasite transmission and parasite-associated disease in caribou. This will provide valuable information about the role of parasitism and climate change in the health and persistence of barrenground caribou populations.

"Rapid climate change, is radically, and probably irreversibly, altering arctic ecosystems. Infectious disease, parasitic disease in particular, together with climate warming, may be playing an important role in recent and widespread caribou population declines across the North American Arctic. Climate change could increase the impact of parasitic disease in arctic ungulates by: (1) changing the transmission patterns of the existing parasites; and (2) introduction of new parasite species to na�ve populations. 

This research will investigate the response to climate change of an important abomasal (stomach) nematode, Ostertagia gruehneri, in caribou. This parasite can reduce body condition and pregnancy rates in reindeer and impact the population. We will examine the growth and development rates of O. gruehneri on the tundra and determine how changes in temperature and/or humidity may impact the parasite. Companion studies on captive reindeer will determine the fate of infective larvae when they are ingested by caribou (ie. Do they mature immediately or enter arrested development). These data will provide important information for understanding and modeling the transmission and impacts of O. gruehneri in caribou under different climate warming scenarios.

This research will also identify the gastrointestinal nematodes that may be introduced to caribou populations through the northward expansion of deer and elk populations and will investigate the susceptibility of caribou to these parasites. 

Results will provide new information on the potential impacts of climate change on existing parasite communities in caribou and the risks associated with northern range expansion of new parasite species. This research will provide critical information for management and conservation of caribou in a rapidly changing climate. Principles will be relevant to all subspecies of Rangifer and to other host-parasite systems globally.

"Interdisciplinary teams are required to make complex decisions that require the integration of different processes and information sources, often across distributed settings. Healthcare is an excellent domain to study the behavior of interdisciplinary teams as the provision of modern health services involves members of multiple professional groups, with different knowledge levels and often residing in different physical locations. A good analogy to draw upon is a supply chain, which represents the set of processes that integrate suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers as a virtual organization in order to deliver products to a customer. Supply chains are facilitated by a supply chain management system (SCMS), which is an information system (IS) architecture that ensures the right information is available for the right process at the right time. There is no equivalent model that represents the integration of information sources and work processes for interdisciplinary teams.



The overall objective of this research program is to develop a novel methodological approach for integrating the diverse information flows and work processes of interdisciplinary teams. The research will focus on healthcare but it will have applicability for teams in other application domains. The research program will be done in two phases. Phase one will involve developing of an information model of an interdisciplinary team using ontological engineering and service oriented architecture as formal techniques. Phase two will evaluate the proposed methodology in the domain of hospice palliative care (HPC).

"The Science of Mathematical Finance deals with problems in financial markets, such as investing, hedging, pricing and risk management. Over the last 30 years ideas and methods of Math Finance have been adopted by the leading banks, insurance companies and pension funds around the globe and have become essential for the efficient operation of financial markets.



At the heart of Mathematical Finance lies the modelling of financial data. A good model should be realistic and computationally efficient at the same time. Those models which have explicit formulas for important quantities (such as the prices of European options) are called ""solvable"" and are the most popular in the industry. The problem is that there are just a few solvable models and most of them are just too simple to capture the phenomena observed in market data. The work I propose to do is to construct new solvable stochastic models (and classify existing ones), which might be better suited for the particular problems in math finance, as well as other areas in applied science. This research lies at the intersection of several branches of science, such as applied mathematics, theory of stochastic processes and theory of special functions. The possible applications of these new solvable models in Mathematical Finance include pricing of American type options, exotic options, credit risk modelling, interest rate and stochastic volatility modelling.

"Our research is on power aware, energy aware and performace aware circuits.



Over the last several years the CMOS technology facilitates very large - one billion devices designs while the CMOS nano-scale technologies introduce a static power dissipation even in classical digital circuits. There have been two main trends in dealing with the problem of rapidly increasing power dissipation. The first commonly used techniques concentrates on direct power reduction though reduction of the static - leakage current. In its simplest implementation a pass transistor in placed in series with the supply voltage and used to open a circuit during the no-activity periods. This proposal deals with the more recent techniques where the circuit itself or the signal processing block architecture is changed to allow for adjustment of critical parameters - and power dissipation on per need basis. These techniques were recently been termed ""power aware"" or ""energy aware"" circuits. Such ""awareness"" is obtained through ""digitally assisted"" mixed-signal or analog design. It is believed that such techniques would be widely adopted over the next decade uniquely addressing the nano-scale CMOS technology leakage and process parameter variation. Compared to currently uses ""worst corners"" design methodology significant power savings would be achieved.

Extending our previously published work we would continue work in areas of wireline communications, frequency synthesis, oscillator design and reconfigurable digital designs.

"Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease that is an ever-increasing public health issue. Canadian data (from Statistics Canada) shows that in 2001, 4.1% of adults (people 12 years of age and older) were diagnosed with diabetes. Most of the long-term health problems associated with diabetes, such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy, result from the sustained hyperglycemia (blood glucose > 11.0 mmol/L).  To stabilize this condition, exogenous insulin is required for Type I diabetics or Type II diabetics who have failed oral medications. Currently, the most common medical treatment for them recommends three to four daily capillary blood glucose (CBG) measurements, and an equivalent number of subcutaneous insulin injections. In clinical practice, it is difficult to assess whether a certain dosing strategy is optimal or not, and even more even to assess how well a patient is doing in his or her glucose control. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate a control algorithm that aims at optimizing the dosing strategy and provide a performance measure for clinicians and patients. The novelty of this project is utilizing advanced modeling and control theory in performance assessment of patient compliance for diabetic control. The uniqueness of this research is in its potential use by many physicians for patient care without fancy equipment. This research will provide a quantification to show to both physicians and patients how good or poor the current practice is. The expected outcome is a performance measure for CBG control on a daily or weekly basis. In patients who are known to be poorly compliant, physicians will be able to recommend what the minimum CBG testing should be and what dosing strategy would be optimal for a particular patient's CBG results. Through these steps and results, the long-term objective of this project will be achieved by improving overall patient compliance and achieving better glycemic control. The impact will be in the reduction of mortality and morbidity related to vascular complications for patients with diabetes.

"The objective of the research is to develop mathematical programming models and solution methods for important problems in production and logistics that integrate both operational and financial perspectives. With increasing globalization of markets and re-structuring of industries e.g. power industry new opportunities arise for modeling problems where operational and financial decisions need to be jointly considered. Furthermore, the increasing liberalization of markets and industries has created an unprecedented increase in uncertainty in prices and quantities for vital resources in modern society. Traditional models treat the financial and operational decisions separately and independently. Decisions from these typical models can be vastly irrelevant in modern environments. To this end, we aim to develop unique stochastic programming models for problems in energy and transportation where financial instruments/mechanisms or real option decisions are prevalent. Solution methods based on mathematical programming decomposition and heuristics will be developed that exploit the specific structure of the models. We develop two classes of stochastic models. The first class of problems will focus on optimization-based frameworks to evaluate portfolios of energy contracts and other derivatives/contracts for assets that are difficult to evaluate under standard methods. Another class of models and methods will focus on transportation procurement under uncertainty where financial frameworks such as (combinatorial) auctions are used to allocate business to competing transportation providers. These new classes of models and their solution methods will enable greatly improved decision support in many vital areas of society such as the power and transportation sectors.","Production and operations management","Manufacturing processes and products","Mechanical and Industrial Engineering","Kwon, Roy","RGPIN ","Operations research and management science","Industrial engineering","G�nie industriel",1-5

"The overwhelming amounts of multimedia information generated in today's media-centric society present a host of challenges to end-users, businesses and researchers alike: quite simply, technologies for efficient organization, navigation and analysis cannot keep pace. Part of the problem is that consumption of media (browsing/analysis) would be far better served by building a pre-conceived notion of what constitutes an ""interesting"" event, and forcing the media collection to be organized around that, thereby promoting fast and relevant access. The problem of restructuring large media collections for non-linear access is not new, having provided much impetus for both content- and concept-based retrieval: the two core research fronts underpinning current state-of-the-art in video search. Such successes, however, are highly dependent on annotation, and it is becoming increasingly evident that collections are fast outgrowing our abilities to reliably annotate.  Methodologies are desperately needed to automatically organize multimedia contents without the benefit of prior knowledge. This can be cast as a problem in unsupervised pattern or event ""discovery"", wherein an intrinsic representation of a media stream is sought as a basis for its reorganization.  In light of recent advances in visual attention modeling, which considers the natural queues and responses that direct human visual/aural attention, we ask: is it possible that there exist certain intrinsic patterns or irregularities in multimedia data, that can more appropriately reflect natural mappings to semantic events?  Specifically, the proposed research program will address event discovery by investigating the possible synergies between natural, self-organizing approaches to unsupervised learning and the visual attentive mechanisms that appear to significantly guide human interest. The generic scope of this research will result in the development of tools to serve a range of pressing deficiencies in the summarization, navigation and consumption of broadcast news, sports, TV and film production, meetings, personal lifelogs, eChronicles, media-centric management systems and PVR's,  security and unmanned surveillance, biomedical image informatics and biometrics.

"The proposal is a request for funds for a much needed superconducting magnet. My group has developed a strong program in studying properties of novel magnetic materials. In many experiments, we are developing new applications for Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs), the most sensitive magnet field sensors. This proposed magnet will be abilite to produce a high magnet field around the samples of interest but also provide a shielded low magnetic field region to allow the SQUID electronics to operate. At the moment, we do not have the ability to apply a magnetic field on our dilution refrigerator. With this magnet, we will be able to do many new experiments.  For example we will be able to apply the field to the new highly sensitive magneto-caloric sensor that we have developed. This sensor is the most sensitive measurement of this type. It can measure the heat released or absorbed during a low temperature phase transition (similar to melting or freezing of ice), but a thousand times more sensitively than previous measurements. We will use this to detect the smallest levels of heat released from the faintest of phase transitions.  This could allow us to detect new phase transitions or with the detection of released heat, put significant constraints on theories to describe the material. A magnet would allow us to extend our studies of phase transitions in materials such as Ho:YLF as a function of magnetic field.  We have also developed a high-speed charge detector that should be very effective in studying single spin states of a quantum dot devices for quantum computing applications.  To apply this detector to study spin states, a magnet is essential in order to orient the electron spins within the quantum dot.

"The NSERC CIAM project will enable the international team, consisting of the groups of: Stefan Kycia from Canada, Daniela Zanchet from Brazil, and Felix Requejo from Argentina, to develop novel nanoparticles and solve their structure in greater detail. Synthesis of metallic and bimetallic nanoparticles, such as Ag, Ni, Pt, Pt/Pd, and more complex systems, such as TiO2 or ZrO2 capped Au nanoparticles will be the targets of this proposed collaboration and will take advantage of rapid feedback by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), followed by a high resolution, detailed structure determination obtained by Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy (EXAFS) and High Energy X-Ray Scattering, High-Resolution Radial Distribution Function (HR-RDF) measurements. Complementary information about electronic structure will be obtained by X-Ray Absorption Near Edge Structure Spectroscopy (XANES). The structure results will be interpreted with the aid of computer simulations. There is significant overlap of interest and expertise on the science and technology aspects of nanoparticles production and characterization by the three PIs; till now, however, each group has approached this scientific problem from its respective point of view. Zanchet has been working on nanoparticles from the crystal growth standpoint and HRTEM, Kycia has worked on a variety of x-ray diffraction aspects of nanostructures, has performed pioneering work on the development of HR-RDF and has been recently making progress with molecular dynamics modeling of nanoparticles. Requejo has been working on core/shell nanoparticle synthesis and their characterization by x-ray absorption techniques (EXAFS and XANES). The present proposal should serve as a bridge to establish a collaboration to develop and characterize nanoparticle systems that are specifically tailored for catalysis and quantum information applications.

"The determination of crystalline structure has traditionally been accomplished by means of single crystal and polycrystalline x-ray diffraction techniques. Both have been developed extensively and have had great success over the years. Nanoscience has presented several fundamental problems that cannot be solved by current techniques of any kind, therefore hindering the progress in the understanding of basic issues. For instance, what is the atomic arrangement and composition of a nanocrystal? New, 'non-traditional' x-ray scattering methods must be developed in order to answer these questions. My group intends to resolve fine details of the atomic structure of free nanoparticles of gold and silver as well as binary alloys. These studies will be performed by high energy x-ray diffraction, (high resolution radial distribution method) and by anomalous x-ray diffraction method.  These are methods that we have been developing over the years to allow the atomic resolution of nanoparticles.  We will continue to study the chemical composition, strain and elastic energy of self-assembled islands and other epitaxial systems by means of grazing incidence x-ray diffraction. The group will also develop powder diffraction and multiple beam diffraction for ab-initio structure determination of systems ranging from quasicrystals to protein crystals.

"In Canada, significant northward range expansions of several wildlife diseases increasingly threaten the health of humans, domestic animals, and native species. The monetary costs of managing an increasing array of wildlife disease is untenable for many natural resource agencies; as such, there is a significant need to understand the mechanisms of disease maintenance and spread to maximize available resources. Specifically, I will investigate coevolutionary mechanisms within vector/pathogen complexes using the raccoon rabies virus, and its primary vector, raccoons, as a model system. Conventional belief suggests that rabies is a lethal disease with no potential for evolution within its hosts. Disease challenge and vaccination experiments, however, indicate that variability exists in the immune response of raccoons to this virus. I will explore the ability of raccoons and raccoon populations to adapt to raccoon rabies by profiling major histocompatiblity complex (Mhc) genes that are intimately associated with the initiation of an immune response. My research will contribute to our understanding of the spatial organization of disease resistance and susceptibility, enhance our knowledge of coevolutionary mechanisms associated with disease spread and maintenance, and help refine current disease control strategies.

"The remarkable achievements of the microelectronics industry during the last four decades has been entirely due to fabrication technology. Engineers have been getting better and better at making transistors smaller and smaller, and transistors are the workhorses of the microelectronics world. Computers, cell phones, palm pilots, and so on, have been getting smaller and faster because engineers have been able to squeeze more and more transistors on a single chip. The number of transistors on a single chip has been doubling every year for the last forty years. By any measure, this is an astounding achievement. But how much longer can this last? Many physicists believe we are very near the end of this trend. 



The basic principles of a transistor's operation have remained essentially constant during this period of sustained exponential miniaturisation. But transistors are becoming so small, that they are now entering the realm described by quantum theory rather than the classical, Newtonian rules that hold sway over our macroscopic world. The physical principles on which the transistor is based simply break down in the quantum realm. 



Rather than fight against quantum theory, my research aims to discover new governing principles upon which a new breed of transistors and the like can be based. These truly quantum devices will be capable of feats their classical counterparts can never achieve. In the strange quantum world, for example, a bit -- the zeroes and ones of binary logic -- can essentially be both zero and one at the same time. In effect, multiple computations can occur in the same system at the same time. This is the essence of the quantum computer. We are not quite there yet, but many groups around the world are racing to get there.

"This application is for support of collaborative research for a duration of three years between Queen's University and Cameco Corp. to investigate the role that iron plays in forming uranium deposits and the viability of using the oxidation state of iron (Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio) in clay minerals and whole-rock samples as an exploration tool. The central premise is that iron reduces uranium to form the deposit so that the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio will vary as a function of proximity to uranium mineralization. The test-case will be the McArthur River deposit in the Athabasca Basin, the world's largest high-grade uranium deposit, and samples will be collected from both proximal and distal areas around the deposit. The purpose of the project will be to investigate possible vectors to uranium mineralization and estimate the feasibility of Fe oxidation state as an indirect exploration tool, both in isolation and in conjunction with other geochemical parameters. The ultimate goal is to develop novel geochemical tools for unconformity-related uranium exploration, with the techniques and protocols developed applicable to other deposits in the Athabasca Basin and to other types of uranium deposits, thereby benefitting industry. This research will involve one MSc student, one Post-Doctoral Fellow and one faculty member at Queen's University, along with staff geologists at Cameco Corp. The knowledge generated will be disseminated by written and oral communications with Cameco Corp and through publications in the scientific literature.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","Energy resources","Geological Sciences and Geological Engineering","Kyser, Kurtis","CRDPJ ","Earth science (see also marine geology 4604)","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",1-3
"The largest and highest grade uranium deposits in the world occur in ancient sedimentary basins, particularly in Saskatchewan, Canada, and the Northern Territory, Australia.  Uranium deposits occur in these basins near the unconformity, which is the boundary between much older basement rocks and younger sediments that overlie them.  The recent surge in uranium prices and the realization that known uranium resources soon will be exhausted has prompted exploration in other ancient basins in Canada in which uranium showings occur.  Two such basins, the western Thelon Basin in Nunavut and the older Otish Basin in Quebec, are currently being explored by two Canadian companies, Cameco Corp and Uravan Minerals Inc.  These basins have been under-explored, and there is a need to decipher the character and timing of the fluids that created the showings and evaluate their similarities, if any, to the large unconformity-type uranium deposits in Saskatchewan.

    )	The research we are proposing will be a collaborative effort that includes 1 PDF, 2 PhD students, 3 Research Associates, 2 faculty and several personnel at Cameco and Uravan who will evaluate how the showings formed, where the fluids that formed them originated, what was the driver for fluid flow and what properties of these showings can be exploited in exploration for economic uranium deposits.  The research has an applied component to understand how uranium mineralization in other basins in Canada formed and to provide data and geochemical techniques to refine exploration strategies for uranium.  It also has a pure research component in evaluating how concentrations of uranium have formed in Paleoproterozoic basins of different ages, what is the likely source of the uranium and whether the character of fluids in basins have changed through time.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","Energy resources","Geological Sciences and Geological Engineering","Kyser, Kurtis","CRDPJ ","Economic geology","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",3-3

"The long-term goal of my research is to understand the migration of elements through the geosphere and biosphere, with implications for both earth science and biology. The basis of this research is that sources of elements can be identified through both their concentrations and their isotopes. My goal is to recognize elements and isotopic systems that define various reservoirs throughout the geosphere and biosphere and use these to track element migration in the near surface environment.

    )	The shorter-term goals will focus on two diverse yet related themes: (1) Energy and Mineral Resources and (2) Biosphere-Geosphere Interactions. For the first theme, research will focus on the fluid history of two ancient basins, one in Australia (a PhD project) and one in Guyana (a PDF project), both of which may host reserves of uranium. The fundamental problems to be addressed involve the oxygen content of ancient atmospheres and what fluids affected the basins and mobilized uranium in these and similar basins in Canada. In addition, a PhD thesis will examine uranium isotopes in uranium deposits and in basins to better understand the natural uranium cycle, and another PhD thesis will focus on lithium isotopes in basins and alteration minerals in uranium deposits to better understand hydrothermal processes that operate in basins.

    )	Transfer of material across the geosphere-biosphere interface will be studied in three diverse, yet related projects: (1) a PhD project will use elemental contents and a PDF will use isotopes in tree-rings and soils to track the temporal migration of elements from sources in Ontario, (2) collaboration on tracking of elements from the geosphere into the tissues of migrating birds and protected mammals to refine their movements, and (3) a PhD student will understand the role of microbes in precipitation of carbonates and test the reliability of the chemistry of brachiopods to reflect that of seawater. Together, the projects will span the entire earth system, ranging from the cycling of uranium and evolution of basins and seawater, to identifying sources of elements and isotopes that transect the geosphere-biosphere interface.","Earth sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Geological Sciences and Geological Engineering","Kyser, Kurtis","RGPIN ","Earth science (see also marine geology 4604)","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",1-5

"Necrotic enteritis (NE) remains an important disease in poultry.  Despite considerable research over the last 30 years, the issues regarding the underlying etiology of necrotic lesions in broiler chickens still remain unresolved.  According to industry experts, NE is a re-emerging disease.  Moreover, because of large hidden economic cost associated with sub-clinical NE, and also because of the high risk of pathogen transfer to the food chain and public health concerns, this problem is perceived among the industry experts as a major issue. NE is a problem of significant importance for the Canadian and global poultry industry.  Considering the significant gaps in understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, there is an urgent need to initiate basic research on the characteristics of pathogens and on pathogen-host interaction etiology of NE. Development of better means for controlling NE in poultry would definitely be of strategic importance. 



At present there is no practical solution to the problem of necrotic enteritis.  In order to address the concerns of the industry and the consumers, a research program aimed at elucidation of primary factors associated with the pathogenesis of necrotic enteritis has been developed.   Our primary objectives are to conduct a study that will define the factors and mechanisms generated by C. perfringens that on one hand play a crucial role in the initiation of the necrotic lesion, and on the other hand force the host system to generate self-destructive enzymes that further perpetuate tissue degeneration leading to necrotic enteritis.  This knowledge may prove to be essential for the development of broadly effective strategies to prevent NE.

"In this research proposal, we focus mostly on optimization problems whose goals are to minimize the risk of an investor aiming to achieve, on average, a given return on investment. We postulate a market environment in which the investor is allowed to continuously rebalance his portfolio of stocks upon observation of the market evolution. The research avenues that we propose are all motivated by a desire to bring more realism into the modeling of this risk-return tradeoff problem.



An idea crucial to this proposal is that of duality. When confronted with a challenging optimization problem, the duality approach creates an alternative related optimization problem, called the dual problem, which is typically simpler than the original problem. The solution to the relatively easier dual problem is then used to construct a solution for the original problem of interest. We will apply this idea, but in a way that differs from applications typically found in the current mathematical finance literature by being more systematic and algorithmic.

"Une structure combinatoire est une � construction � descriptible en un nombre fini d'�tapes (par exemple: un sch�ma de r�seau routier entre diverses villes, un diamant taill�, une mol�cule en chimie, une structure hi�rarchique en forme d'arbre, une construction rigide faite avec des tiges de m�tal, etc).  On peut, par exemple, vouloir analyser un diamant selon ses � sym�tries � ou encore �tudier les r�seaux routiers selon le nombre de routes arrivant ou aboutissant � chaque ville.



Le projet de recherche consiste essentiellement en l'analyse des sym�tries, la classification, l'engendrement et l'�num�ration de diverses structures combinatoires apparaissant en math�matiques pures ou appliqu�es, notamment en informatique.  Il se situe dans le prolongement naturel de mes travaux r�cents en combinatoire �num�rative couverts par mes derni�res subventions du CRSNG.

Elles me permettent d'approfondir la classification des structures combinatoires existantes, de cr�er de nouvelles structures et d'�laborer diverses m�thodes d'analyse de leurs param�tres descriptifs.

"The ultimate goal of my research is to highlight similarities and differences in the brain pathways that organize behaviour in different vertebrates in order to create a basic model of the behavioural brain (also called 'limbic system'). I propose to study the structure and function of the brain regions that control behaviour in amphibians, with an emphasis on the regions that integrate sensory input. I will approach this problem from three different angles: behaviour, structure and function. Firstly, I will do behavioural experiments identifying relevant cues that will be used later in functional studies. Secondly, I will use anatomical methods to describe the architecture of brain pathways involved in the control of behaviour. Thirdly, I will measure brain activity elicited by behaviourally relevant stimuli using two different methods: a) direct recording of brain electrical activity; b) labelling of indirect markers of neuronal activation. My research plan is 'comparative' in that it involves comparison of amphibian brains with the better known but highly complex brains of mammals. A better knowledge of the behavioural brain is needed to understand what lies at the root of neuropsychological disorders. This work could generate new approaches to elucidate the great complexity of the mammalian limbic system. It could be used to design robotics control programs for self-evaluating/self-learning machines. It could also help explain how evolution of the brain modified behavioural capacities in vertebrates.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Integrative Biology","Laberge, Fr�d�ric","RGPIN ",Neurophysiology,"Animal biology","Biologie animale",1-5

"T cells, a type of white blood cells, patrol the organism to detect the presence of infectious agent. Antigenic fragment coming from infectious agent are presented to T cells in association with self-molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), by specialized cells of the immune system. The recognition of foreign substances (or antigens) by T cells via their T cell receptor (TCR), induced a variety of responses that will permit the elimination of the pathogen. Thus, T cells are crucial to fight life-threatening microbes. One goal of our research program is to identify the signals that are needed to generate an efficient response by T cells.

Each T cells expresses a distinct TCR that will be able to recognize a particular infectious agent. These different TCRs are generated by random juxtaposition of the different gene segments coding for the TCR in the genome. This process can generate up to 10e15 different TCRs. Since TCRs are produced in a random fashion and since they will recognize foreign substances in association with self-molecules the specificity of the TCR expresses by a T cell needs to be tested to make sure that: 1) it is not reactive against self-substances expressed by our own cells to avoid their destruction; 2) it will eventually be able to recognize a foreign substances in association with our self-MHC molecules; and 3) it has been correctly produced during the random events of its generation. This is tested during T cell development in the thymus. A better understanding of the mechanism by which T cells expressing an appropriate TCR are generated is pivotal to understand how T cells successfully eliminate foreign substances without generating autoimmunity (self-attack). Another goal of our proposal is to better understand how T cells are generated during their development in the thymus.

All developmental processes and cellular responses to change in the environment are controlled by complex signaling cascades. The work described in this grant application will specifically evaluate the contribution of a new signaling molecule, ERK3, during T cell development and response to infectious agent.

"Plus de 450 vari�t�s de fromages fins et de fromages de fabrication artisanale sont produites au Canada. Selon les chiffres du Centre canadien d'information laiti�re, les fromages de sp�cialit� ont connu la plus forte augmentation au niveau de la consommation annuelle au Canada, passant de 3,61 kg (en 1980) � 7,36 kg (en 2004) par personne. D'ailleurs, ces fromages ont atteint une production record au pays, en 2004, avec pr�s de 220 000 tonnes m�triques. Malgr� cet effort industriel remarquable, la p�n�tration du march� canadien par les produits �trangers est croissante, les ventes ayant augment� de 14% dans les cinq derni�res ann�es. Ainsi la balance commerciale est pass�e d'une faible exportation de 1993 � 1999 (+64M$) vers une forte importation de 2000 � 2004 (-196M$). Les fromages � cro�te fleurie (Camembert, Brie) et � cro�te lav�e sont affin�s en surface par des levures et des moisissures. Ces microorganismes forment une cro�te qui est responsable � la fois de l'aspect visuel du fromage et du d�veloppement de compos�s de flaveur. L'un des soucis majeurs pour les transformateurs est la fabrication de fromages de qualit� constante afin de satisfaire les consommateurs. Cependant, l'augmentation rapide des capacit�s de production induit des variations dans la qualit� du produit. Les principaux objectifs de cette programmation de recherche visent � caract�riser une levure nomm�e Geotrichum candidum, qui est essentielle � la fabrication de plusieurs fromages du terroir. La mise au point de techniques de g�notypage et l'identification des principes gouvernant la formation de compos�s de flaveur seront �tudi�es. Le but � long terme est d'accro�tre les connaissances scientifiques afin de comprendre le r�le des levures dans la typicit� des fromages du terroir. Ceci permettra une meilleure ma�trise des proc�d�s technologiques r�sultant en une am�lioration du d�veloppement des flaveurs.

"C*-dynamical systems were initially introduced to model quantum mechanical systems. The observable magnitudes are represented by elements of a C*-algebra, on which a time evolution (a group of automorphisms) is given. In addition to time evolutions, other group actions (e.g. symmetries) can also be modelled via a generalization of this idea. The dynamical or geometric information can be subsumed in an algebraic construction, called the crossed product algebra, which has proven relevant in a number of abstract situations beyond its original physical motivation. The proposed research aims to develop methods to analyze symmetries and equilibrium states of C*-dynamical systems, and to use these methods in the study of questions arising from various areas of mathematics like number theory, dynamical systems, and geometric group theory. There is evidence that constructions and techniques inspired by physical systems can shed new light onto long-standing problems and can generate relevant questions and new examples on which  to test the existing knowledge. One such phenomenon is that of phase transition with spontaneous symmetry-breaking, in which a system can be in equilibrium in a variety of asymmetric configurations at low temperature, while having only one equilibrium state at high temperature. Everyday examples of this are the freezing of water into ice and the spontaneous magnetization of  a ferromagnet  at room temperature which is lost through heating.

"The long range objective of this research program is to develop an economically viable and consumer acceptable technology that would improve lactation persistency and enable longer lactation in dairy cows. From a mammary gland perspective, milk production is simply a function of the number of secretory cells and the secretory activity of these cells.  In goats,   it is the loss of secretory cells which accounts for the decrease in milk yield during declining lactation.  It is now well established in rodents and ruminants that mammary cell loss during involution (termination of lactation) occurs through programmed cell death (apoptosis).  Apoptosis also occurs in late lactation and accounts for the progressive loss of secretory cells in declining lactation.  Therefore, there are considerable incentives to identify the factors that regulate mammary apoptosis, in particular during these early stages of gradual involution.

My hypotheses are:-It is possible to reduce the rate of decline in milk production by reducing the rate of mammary cell death;-The milking-induced PRL release is important to maintain the differentiation and the survival of the mammary epithelial cells;-Stanniocalcin reduces intracellular level of Ca2+ which reduce synthesis of milk component.

My short range objectives are:1- To evaluate apoptosis, cell proliferation and expression of STC in cows with different rates of lactation decline. Factors affecting rate of  lactation decline will be parity, pregnancy and feed restriction.  2- To determine the role of calcium homeostasis in the control of mammary gland functions 3- To determine the role of milking induce release of prolactin on lactation persistency. Rate of lactation decline, gene expression, and cell apoptosis will be evaluated in cows where prolactin release will be prevented during 8 weeks by administration of an inhibitor of prolactin release.4- To determine the factors controling the magnitude of milking-induced release of prolactin

"The continuing improvement of ultrasound imaging technology creates opportunities for ultrasound to fill new roles in medical imaging.  Substantial health care benefits can result from new uses of ultrasound, because ultrasound provides advantages in cost, accessibility, and patient safety and comfort compared to other imaging technologies.  Our research team is creating a comprehensive computer simulation resource for use in developing methods to improve the cancer imaging capabilities of ultrasound.  The simulations will use a Southwestern Ontario high-performance computing facility, SHARCNET.  Software will be designed and tested for three-dimensional modeling of the gross and microscopic anatomy of tumours and surrounding tissues and accurate, efficient simulation of the physics of ultrasound image formation.  The tissue and tumour models will be designed for research on two topics where ultrasound technology is rapidly advancing: breast cancer detection and high-resolution imaging of small animals used in cancer research.  The breast cancer simulations will investigate methods to improve the ability of ultrasound to screen for small tumours.  This capability would be especially valuable for patients younger than 40 years, because young women who develop breast cancer generally have the most aggressive tumours and mammography often produces unsatisfactory images of young patients.  The small animal imaging simulations will be used to define more reliable methods to evaluate new cancer therapies in the laboratory.  Small animal imaging has the potential to accelerate and reduce the costs of cancer drug development by ensuring that only the most promising drugs are selected for clinical trials in human patients.  In both of these areas, existing computer and experimental models for ultrasound imaging rely on idealizations of the physical properties of tissue that are avoided in the computational methods established by our research team.  We expect that the proposed simulation platform will provide a valuable tool for addressing these and other challenging issues in cancer imaging.

"Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) represent an enabling technology for mobile phone manufacturers, who are providing ever more sophisticated location-based services that represent a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide. Under open-sky conditions where direct lines-of-sight (LOS) between users and satellites are available, GNSS performance is sufficiently high to satisfy all but the most stringent requirements. The major challenge is to provide capability in non-LOS (NLOS) environments such as indoors and in urban canyons, primarily because of the very low received power of signals. Several related critical questions remain

unanswered and that can be divided into the areas of signal propagation and integrated system development. The former addresses the characteristics of the signals that are received (which can differ considerably from the transmitted signals due to attenuation and reflection) and the corresponding implications on performance. The latter considers systems that use GNSS and other low-cost sensors to improve location performance.



This project addresses mobile phone navigation in poor signal environments. First, it will characterize the GNSS signals received under a variety of operating conditions. Using carefully designed tests and sophisticated data processing strategies, a direct measure of GNSS signals in real operating conditions will be obtained. These measurements will be unique within the GNSS community and will provide valuable insight into what signals GNSS receivers measure in such environments. Second, the use of low-cost sensors to provide position and velocity information when GNSS signals are unreliable or unavailable will be investigated. Integration of GNSS and other sensors will be studied with particular attention given to the mobile phone environment, which experiences motions considerably different from other applications. Finally, by combining the knowledge gained in the above two tasks, insight into how to improve mobile phone performance will be obtained and used to enhance future generation of mobile phones.

"This project focuses on the development of innovative GNSS signal processing techniques that can be used in real-time in a software receiver to improve availability, accuracy and reliability of GNSS such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) indoors. During the past 10 years, new processing techniques have resulted in the use of GPS indoor and the commercialization of scores of new applications such as mobile phone location and pedestrian navigation devices (PND).  The characteristics of the new signals being deployed with the second generation of GPS satellites and the forthcoming Galileo and other GNSS makes these signals better suited for use under indoor attenuated signal conditions and are resulting in an urgent need to carry out the research proposed herein and to train related high quality personnel needed by the GNSS industry to continue its rapid growth.  The PND sector alone is expected to grow by 50% per year according to leading companies in this area.  The research will include the development of ultra high sensitivity techniques for signal acquisition and tracking that will necessarily rely on long time integration. Issues related to oscillator stability and tracking loop aiding from self-contained sensors will be given priority. The new processing techniques to be developed under this project will be optimized for real time effectiveness and implemented in a software receiver.  This will allow thorough testing and evaluation under a wide range of indoor attenuated signal scenarios, to better under the advantages and limitations of the new signals in term of performance in the indoors and contribute to the growth of the GNSS industry in Canada and abroad. Implementation in a software receiver is important due to cost, reconfigurability and the staged introduction of the new signals and related algorithms.

"Altricial animal species (rats, mice, dogs and cats for example) are born with their eyes closed and an immature visual system while precocial animals (such as guinea pigs and human for example) are born with their eyes open and a relatively mature visual system. It is said for example, that at birth, the retinal development of a rat pup is equivalent to that of a human fetus after 26 weeks of gestation. During the first month of life significant maturational changes will take place in order to bring the visual system of the neonatal rat to near adulthood structure and function. In the course of our investigation on the maturation of the visual system, I noticed that adult rats exposed to a very bright luminous environment developed a debilitating retinopathy known as light-induced retinopathy. In comparison, younger (less than 30 days old) rats subjected to the same experimental procedure acquired a significantly less severe form of the disease. Some aspects of the juvenile form suggested a reorganization of the retinal structure in order to minimize the consequences of bright light exposure. Understanding how these reorganization strategies are achieved could not only prove determinant in furthering our understanding of postnatal retinal maturation processes in altricial animals but also postulate on  the retinal maturation processes taking place in utero in precocial animals and how this processes can be altered by exogenous stresses. Furthermore our model will also allow us to compare, for an equivalent stress, the reorganization strategies and resulting structural and functional consequences that differentiate the altricial and prococial models, giving rise to possibly new investigative strategies to explore neural plasticity in mature neural pathways.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge",Ophthalmology,"Lachapelle, Pierre","RGPIN ","Animal biology","Animal biology","Biologie animale",1-5

"Construction, one of Canada's leading industries, significantly contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases and the depletion of natural resources. Construction activities consume more raw materials by weight than any other industrial sector. As much as 50% of all materials extracted from the earth's crust are transformed into construction materials and products. In addition, the built environment accounts for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions (about 40%) in terms of energy end usage. Development of new environment-friendly building materials can lead to lower greenhouse gas emission, greater consumption of waste, durable construction, optimal sustainable use of renewable resources, enhancement of material recyclability, and overall sustainable development. 



The proposed research program aims to contribute to the reduction of the negative environmental impacts and the depletion of natural resources of the construction industry by developing and evaluating a novel class structural lightweight self-consolidating concrete (LWSCC). This environment-friendly concrete will be developed by incorporating natural, commercial, and recycled lightweight aggregates as well as industrial by-products such as fly ash and slag as supplementary cementitious materials. The research will evaluate LWSCC properties from fresh stage to performance as large-scale structural members under simulated and actual conditions. It is anticipated that the proposed program will enable leading edge research and training of highly qualified personnel in a broad range of real-world infrastructure problems, including sustainability of natural resources, recycling, and durability, along with a very high level of performance in extremely demanding environments. The resulting research can have a major impact on the design, construction practices, and management related to infrastructure and can help promote Canadian technology and expertise worldwide, thus bringing important economic benefits to Canada.

"To better understand future climate change and its potential impacts on British Columbia's forests, our research examines evidence deposited in lake sediments over thousands of years to study how natural variability in climate affected plant communities in the past. The main objectives of our research are: 1) to understand the development of vegetation communities on the Pacific coast of Canada since the last ice age; 2) to determine how climate has changed during that time; and, 3) to understand the role of factors other than climate (e.g., ecological differences in tree species such as shade tolerance) in how and why vegetation communities change on long-time scales. We collect cores of sediment from lakes along the coast of British Columbia and identify plant remains such as pollen and seeds that were deposited in those lakes in the past and are preserved in their sediments today. This allows us to determine how the composition of surrounding plant communities has changed since deposition of the lake sediments. We also analyze other fossils such as insect remains as well as the physical properties of the lake sediments to identify past environmental changes, including changes in climate, hydrological regimes and erosion rates. By combining data from several lakes, we can identify regional patterns in past climate change, including the rates and magnitudes of those changes, and use these to understand how forests have responded to past changes in climate. For example, previous research found that warmer and drier summers between about 7000 and 10,000 years ago changed the geographic distribution of many plant species, and that forest fires were more common than today. By understanding past environmental changes like these, we can predict and thus better prepare for the impacts of future climate change. This research has many important social and economic implications for Canadian society, ranging from providing relevant knowledge for management and conservation of our forests and other ecosystems today, to providing archaeologists and First Nations peoples with reconstructions of the ecological and environmental context that human populations experienced in the past.

"When learning to associate a set of instances to a given category (for example, learning that German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, and Chihuahuas are dogs), people acquire knowledge that can then be transferred to novel instances and situations. Simultaneously, people also develop mental representations of the things that they categorize. The goal of this program of research will be to extend our understanding of the development of verbal and perceptual knowledge as it unfolds during the categorization process. 



The main laboratory categorization task that I will use involves giving participants a simple verbal rule to categorize artificial stimuli. For example, participants might be told to put ""blue and rectangular"" objects in one category and ""red and curvilinear"" objects in another. The questions to be answered will include: What is the impact of prolonged learning on people's ability to learn the different features (color, shape, etc) that make up stimuli during the categorization process? How salient must features not specified by the verbal rule be in order to be learned? How predictive of category membership must features not specified by the verbal rule be in order to be learned? To what extent do explicit verbal knowledge and implicit perceptual knowledge drive category decisions? What is the impact of using imperfect verbal rules on learning? 



Ultimately, the interest of answering these questions is that they will help establish a link between categorization paradigms and other productive paradigms in cognitive psychology, as well as embed the categorization literature in a larger theoretical framework on learning and memory.

"Needle loss in Balsam fir threatens the survival of the 97 million dollar Atlantic Canada Christmas Tree and Greenery industry. The exact cause of needle drop is not known. Clones with high needle abscission resistance are yet to be identified and developed. The anatomical, physiological mechanisms of needle abscission resistance in root detached (RD) Balsam fir are yet to be uncovered. The initiators, the signals and the modulators of needle abscission are also not known. This project will identify the clones with enhanced needle abscission resistance and discover the initiators, signals and the mechanism and the modulators of needle abscission and regulation. We propose that needle drop in RD Balsam fir is initiated by multiple stresses (dehydration, mechanical and extreme temperatures), triggering complex yet unknown cellular signals, involving multiple plant hormones and/or certain volatiles, promoting a cascade of senescence reactions, resulting in dissolution of certain cell wall components at the point of attachment, promoting abscission. This project will lead to several discoveries relating to causal factor, signals, needle abscission physiology and needle abscission resistance mechanism(s) of RD Balsam fir. An understanding of these processes will help to screen and identify the genotypes with enhanced needle abscission resistance and develop technologies to control needle loss contributing directly to the sustainability of the Christmas tree industry to retain its competitive position and contribute to Canadian bioeconomy and human resource development.",Agriculture,"Advancement of knowledge","Plant and Animal Sciences","Lada, Rajasekaran","CRDPJ ","Plant and treebiology","Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",1-5
"MOTIVATION: Ear surgery is challenging because the internal structures of the ear are delicate and tiny. Currently, training in ear surgery is done using an apprenticeship approach in which the trainee observes a surgeon then practices the procedure on patients. This approach places patients at risk. As an alternative, we have developed a training simulator using virtual-reality (VR) technology. The simulator presents the trainee with a 3D digital model of the ear that can be operated upon. The trainee uses a ""haptic"" device to interact with the digital ear model. The device simultaneously allows the trainee to move a 3D digital surgical tool and feel interaction forces between the tool and the digital ear model. The forces encountered in ear surgery are tiny and a high-fidelity haptic device is needed to accurately represent them. Our current haptic device is not accurate.

OBJECTIVES: To incorporate high-fidelity haptics into our simulator and to assess the force representation.

APPROACH: We shall interface a magnetic levitation haptic device to our simulator. Interaction forces will be computed using our digital ear model and will be applied to the trainee's hands using the haptic device. We shall assess the realism of the simulated environment by comparing forces calculated using our simulator to those measured during surgery on cadaveric specimens.

NOVEL ASPECTS: Unlike mechanical haptic devices that are commonly available, a magnetic levitation device can accurately represent tiny forces as well as a wide range of stiffnesses from barely perceptible as in the case of the eardrum to rigid as in the case of the skull surrounding the ear. The ear simulator being developed by us is the first VR-based simulator for training in ear surgery. 

SIGNIFICANCE: Using the simulator, trainees can practice on a large variety of realistic virtual ears without risk to actual patients. Moreover, they can practice independently of an instructing surgeon, thus freeing time for surgeons to treat patients. Accurate force representation will allow trainee's to develop skills in the simulated environment that translate readily to the operating room.

"We propose a research program in the combinatorial aspects of set theory and  applications.



It is motivated in particular by Ramsey theory, or partition properties of various structures, toward applications to mathematical problems in general. Indeed for example Ramsey theory was instrumental in W.T. Gowers' positive solution to the homogeneous space problem of Banach. More recently the connections between the

Fraisse theory of amalgamation classes and homogeneous structures, Ramsey theory, and topological dynamics of automorphism groups of countable structures has led to surprising results by A. Kechris, V. Pestov and S. Todorcevic in the study of continuous actions of topological groups on compact spaces, usually referred to as compact G-flows.



This interest has been the main focus of our efforts over the past several years, focusing on the investigation of Ramsey properties of homogeneous structures, including graphs, metric and ultrametric spaces, vector spaces, and more generally relational structures. Most structures are not indivisible (or divisible), meaning that a

partition of the structure into two or more parts exists such that no copy of the structure resides in one part. A full understanding of the Ramsey properties requires the discovery of its canonical partitions, that is those partitions into unavoidable but indivisible blocks. It is natural that such investigations involves related notions,

including age indivisibility (if the age is partitioned into two parts, one of them contains the full age of the structure) and Weak indivisibility (if the structure is partitioned into two parts and one part does not contain the full age, then a copy of structure resides in the other part. We propose to continue investigating the

exact strength and connections between these properties on well known structures.","Mathematical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Mathematics and Statistics","Laflamme, Claude","RGPIN ","Set theory and general topology","Pure mathematics","Math�matiques pures",1-5

"Our efforts are primarily devoted to the structural characterization of lipid self-assemblies in order to gain a better understanding of the structure-function relationships for lipids in biological systems.  First, we are interested in a family of proteins found in the seminal plasma, which extract selectively, by an unknown mechanism, phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol from sperm membranes, a critical step in the sperm maturation.  We propose that the lipid sorting is based on the local curvature of the lipid membranes.  To examine this hypothesis, we will probe the membrane curvature at the molecular level, using solid-state 2H NMR.  We will also use confocal fluorescence microscopy (with fluorescent labelled lipids) to determine at the microscopic level, the lipid distribution in the self-assemblies resulting from the interactions with these proteins.  Finally we will determine quantitatively the lipid specificity by the analysis of the particles resulting from the lipid extractions by these proteins.  Second, the lipids of the top layer of the epidermis are largely responsible for the skin impermeability, a vital property linked to the significant proportion of lipid in crystalline phase.  We will examine the structure and the dynamics of the formation of this solid phase in order to gain a better understanding of the origin of skin impermeability.  By using an infrared microscope equipped with a focal plane array, it will be possible characterize the formation of the crystalline phases (induced by temperature changes or enzymatic activity) in parallel with the formation of domains with heterogeneous lipid compositions at the microscopic scale.  The role of different molecular components of the stratum corneum will be examined.  Third, we recently discovered the possibility to form non-phospholipid liposomes (NPL) using monoacylated amphiphiles and sterols.  These NPL have a very high cholesterol content, they display a remarkable impermeability and an interesting sensitivity to pH.  We want to develop a detailed understanding of the molecular structure of these novel liposomes and to create an extended family of these NPL for which the release of the entrapped material can be triggered by various stimuli, including pH, temperature, and light.

"Riboswitches are structured motifs that usually reside in the non-coding region of mRNAs, where they bind metabolites and control gene expression. Unlike many other genetic control systems, riboswitches do not directly require metabolite-binding proteins to act as sensors, and thus provide a direct link between the genetic information that is encoded by an mRNA and its cellular environment. Among small riboswitches, the lysine riboswitch exhibit an aptamer domain that is organized around a five-way junction, which is expected to be of primary importance for the global architecture of the RNA structure and function. 



The proposed work will first aim at understanding the aptamer domain folding process that is required to attain the native structure using a variety of techniques and more particularly single-molecule FRET, which provides a unique way of determining folding dynamics of RNA macromolecules. Another aspect of the research will be the characterization of the ligand binding site using SELEX, which enables to obtain novel riboswitch ligand binding specificities. We also propose to study a variety of naturally occurring lysine riboswitches which will give vital information about how structurally different representatives can perform gene regulation.



The characterization of the lysine riboswitch will provide new insights on RNA folding mechanisms, and how it is involved in the formation of RNA-ligand productive contacts. This work may aid in the establishment of new RNA tools used for the creation of small transgenes required to manipulate intracellular levels of the essential amino acid lysine in engineered crops, which naturally contain low lysine levels. Lastly, given that there is very little information about the folding of five-way junctions and the influence that they exert in molecules in which they occur (i.e., ribosomal RNA), any structural information obtained here will be highly relevant as a future reference point.

"Conservation laws are continuum models for many applications such as nonlinear elasticity, shock waves in general relativity and workflow in factories, but, historically they were primarily studied as models of compressible fluid flow. As continuum models, nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws occur as scaling limits of molecular, kinetic (statistical) and higher-order models. Invariably, the resulting models are unstable and some of the physics lost in the scaling needs to be re-introduced, typically with an entropy condition, a kinetic relation and possibly additional closures. 



Following recent advances in the well-posedness theory of conservation laws, by, among others, Bressan, Bianchini, LeFloch, Liu and Yang, the research focus has now shifted towards understanding the scaling limits that relate conservation laws to models at other length scales. In the multiscale methodology of E and Engquist, the physically consistent description of physics across multiple length scales requires modeling and numerical tools to approximate these scaling limits, such as domain decomposition, multigrid, mesh adaptivity and the quasicontinuum method. 



Within the vast field of multiscale modeling, Laforest will address two rich topics that collectively touch upon most aspects of the analysis, numerics and modeling of multiscale problems in the theory of conservation laws. Laforest will develop efficient and accurate schemes for multiscale models of conservation laws. He will also study the impact of kinetic relations on the stability of nonconvex conservation laws, both at the continuum and kinetic level.

"The proposed research will generate a comprehensive framework for assessing the landscape controls over permafrost disturbance and the impact of disturbances on vegetation and water quality. This integrated research is necessitated by the presence of two large natural gas fields adjacent to the Sabine Peninsula on northern Melville Island, Nunavut. Development of these resources will require unprecedented infrastructure to recover gas and deliver it to a liquefaction plant on the south coast of Melville Island for shipping to southern markets.

Prior to industrial development in this High Arctic landscape, a framework to understand and predict the sensitivity of land and water to permafrost disturbances and to regional climate changes is required. The need for this research has been further highlighted by extensive permafrost slope disturbances reported on southern Melville Island in 2007-8, and the impact these localized disturbances have had on land, vegetation, and downstream water quality. This initial work demonstrates the need for integrated landscape research across the different physiographic and bioclimatic gradients that exist where energy resource development will occur.  The absence of systematic land/water systems research in the region is acute, but necessary to establish policies that will ensure the appropriate development of the national-scale energy resources on Melville Island.  The research team combines the expertise of researchers from Queen's University and the Canada Centre for Remote to establish a network of study sites that characterize the range of physiographic and bioclimatic conditions in the vicinity of the known gas fields. The research will generate crucial baseline data, cost-effective and innovative strategies for mapping permafrost disturbance and vegetation cover, and a hydrological modeling framework to evaluate the sensitivity of water quality to disturbances. The research team will contribute an integrated understanding of High Arctic systems, train highly qualified personnel, and provide a comprehensive knowledge base to undertake important resource development.",Environment,"Northern development",Geography,"Lafreni�re, Melissa","STPGP ","Physical geography","Physical geography","G�ographie physique",1-3

"For a long time it was believed that the adult human brain could not make new neurons.  Within the last ten years scientists have discovered the adult brain in many different types of species, including humans can develop new neurons. This was a huge breakthrough in neuroscience since these cells provides great hope for treatments that maybe able to replace dying cells for diseases affecting the brain.  It is believed that these new neurons come from stem cells within the brain.  The stem cells divide to produce progeny, which give rise to immature and then finally the mature neuron that is connected to other neurons and is able to generate electrical signals.   One of the places that these new neurons form connections is a place in the brain called the hippocampus, which is important for learning and memory.  In order to be able to use the new cells for treatments, we need to understand how the dividing cells turn into neurons and what signals the cell requires in order to become a functional new neuron?  We also need to know more about what function the new cells perform? This proposal examines both of these questions and specifically looks at how this protein called doublecortin, which is expressed in the immature neuron may be important to both the development of the new neurons and their role in learning and memory.  In order to do this, we will utilize special transgenic mice that have been created without the doublecortin protein and see how many new neurons they are forming and also determine how they perform in behaviors, such as learning and memory. The results from these experiments will provide us with new insight into how the new neuron is formed and what function it has in the adult brain.

"Biological affinity reagents play critical roles in diagnostics, and their use as therapeutic agents is essential to the treatment of disease.  Unfortunately, current methods for the characterization, selection, and evolution of affinity reagents are serial and time intensive.  Such long time scales are prohibitive to the development of new diagnoses and treatments, particularly for new or rapidly spreading disease.  Microfluidics offers an attractive platform to improve the efficiency of affinity reagent selection processes through more stringent control of selection conditions, resulting in fewer necessary selection rounds.  Furthermore, microfabrication also provides the opportunity to significantly decrease the need for manual labor by integrating multiple process steps in a single device.  This proposal describes methods for fabricating integrated microfluidic systems for rapid characterization, selection, and evolution of nucleic acid aptamers.  This work will also contribute to the development of microsystems for the selection and evolution of a broad array of other affinity reagents, including antibodies, peptides, and small molecules.

"The general objective of the proposed research program is to develop and implement a framework and a methodology for the comparative assessment of alternate agricultural mechanization systems (AMS). The study will focus on three main categories of AMS: 1. Tractor-based systems, 2. Wide-span implement carrier systems and other AMS adapted to controlled-traffic farming systems, and 3. Systems that rely on fleets of autonomous vehicles. More specific AMS within each category (e.g., tractor-based system adapted to controlled-traffic requirements) will also be considered. Taking into account a number of crop production systems typical of North American agriculture (e.g., dairy, fruits and vegetables, grain and oilseed, mixed), the specific objectives of the proposed 5-year research program are as follows: 1. To identify specific criteria or sets of criteria for the evaluation of AMS; 2. To assess the relative importance of those criteria for different agricultural production systems; 3. To characterize AMS adapted to these crop production systems, and 4. To assess the performance of the different types of AMS in regards to each of these criteria or sets of criteria. The proposed research program is divided into three interdependent phases that will result into two Master's and one doctoral theses. The undergraduate and graduate students who will be involved in that work will acquire a unique expertise in the evaluation and assessment of alternate agricultural mechanization systems. These individuals will provide an important support for the future development and diversification of the Canadian and global agricultural machinery industry. Providing both the agriculture and agricultural machinery industries with the knowledge and the technologies that twenty-first century agriculture requires will directly contribute to their sustainable development and growth.

"The past decade has seen rapid developments in the fields of ""nanoscience"" and ""nanotechnology"". Although the potential applications derived from nano-objects are promising, such as bit-elements in super-computers, molecular receptors capable of trapping and detecting air or water pollutants, and drug delivery carriers, the potential nanosciences holds has yet to be fulfilled.  In this context, the characterization of these nano-objects or functionalized surfaces using spectroscopic methods combined with advanced microscopy techniques offers information far beyond that provided by pure imaging techniques as it allows the molecular properties of these materials to be correlated with their molecular structures, sizes and compositions. Our program combines state-of-the-art scanning probe microscopies with Raman and Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopies. Enhancement effects coming from metallic particles or electronic resonances will be used to achieve high detection sensitivities. One goal is to develop new versatile vibrational techniques that surpass conventional optical microscopes in terms of spatial resolution and sensitivity. Such techniques will be used to (i) determine confinement effects in nanomaterials, (ii) dynamically measure the change in conformation of molecular systems under various stimuli, (iii) evaluate chemical interactions and dynamical processes in biomolecules, and (iv) develop an ultrasensitive vibrational technique for single molecule detection.","Materials sciences","Advancement of knowledge",Chemistry,"LagugneLabarthet, Francois","RGPIN ","Physical chemistry","Physical chemistry","Chimie physique",3-3

"My research program will continue with the development of affinity probes, especially molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), in mycotoxic and biomedical applications for both the improvement to human health care and the early diagnosis of animal diseases.  Mycotoxins (such as ochratoxin A, patulin and DON) and abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) probably present a more serious and demonstrable risk to public health and food safety worldwide than man-made chemicals do.  The determination of any single mycotoxin or PrPSc at ultratrace levels is most promising by selective pre-concentration using the molecular recognition property of a tailor-made MIP.  For the determination of several mycotoxins or abnormal proteins simultaneously after selective pre-concentration on MIPs, capillary electrophoresis and microfluidics can offer many analytical separation merits.  Our short-term objective is focused on the preparation of novel MIP nanospheres which can specifically recognize single target compounds of mycotoxic and biomedical significance.  Key contemporary and emerging challenges in analytical sciences will be tackled using MIP nanospheres-based methods in several instrumental approaches.  Our long-term objective is escalating the development of powerful MIP nanospheres-based devices, instruments, methods, facilities and expertise that will one day contribute to mycotoxic and biomedical research in collaboration with science departments, government laboratories and federal research institutions in Ottawa and across Canada.

"The proposed program will investigate the long term contaminant migration performance of different microbial and organic contaminants through engineered barrier systems. The main application of this work will be in the pre-design stage assessment of appropriate barrier systems for contaminated sites or containment facilities in terms of quantitative comparisons with other potential technologies. The knowledge gained from the research will also provide information which could lead to more cost effective, yet equally reliable engineered barrier systems for lagoons, landfills, contaminated sites, etc. The research program is subdivided into two main themes: 1) microbial transport through GCLs, and, 2) organic contaminant transport through soil cement mixtures containing coal fly ash. A literature review of these theme areas found a paucity of information currently exists.



The study into microbial transport through GCLs involves examining the role of ""non-advective"" transport (e.g. diffusion, osmosis, motility) of bacteria and viruses through thin bentonite and GCL samples.  A complementary study will examine the potential for this microbial transport through ""damaged"" GCLs and GCL overlapped seams. The study into organic transport through low hydraulic conductivity soil cement mixtures involves examining the diffusion/attenuation of relatively non polar organic compounds through soil cement mixtures containing coal fly ash. The proposed research in combination with other research projects being performed by the applicant will increase the long term performance knowledge base of both types of barrier systems. It will also provide quantitative parameters for rational assessment of these technologies in the long term. The research program will provide training in the geo-environmental engineering area for graduate and undergraduate students in Atlantic Canada, home to one of the largest soil-cement remediation projects in Canadian history (i.e. Sydney Tar Ponds).

"My methodological research interests are in multivariate survival analysis. It consists on the analysis of recurrent events and the analysis of correlated time-to-event variables.



In recurrent events analysis, my interest focus on dependent censoring. We are developing methodologies for modelling dependent censoring and estimating the mean function under these conditions. Multistates models and IPCW estimators are investigated.



In the analysis of correlated time-to-event variables, my research interest focus on deriving goodness-of-fit procedures to test the adequacy of semiparametric models (Copula, Cox model, ...etc) to assess incomplete data sets. Typically, specific procedures are required for each scheme of incomplete data. Examples of such data include bivariate censored data and data subject to dependent truncation.



Other points of interest include nonparametric measure of association between two time-to-events variables with incomplete data and the applications of the Graphic-Copula estimators

"My research is aimed at answering this question: How do living things tell time? All living things bigger than bacteria, and even some bacteria, have internal clocks that drive daily rhythms in many biological processes. These ""circadian"" rhythms (circa diem = about a day) are important in human health: humans have circadian rhythms in activity, sleeping and waking, hormones, body temperature, etc. The internal clocks that drive these rhythms are found in individual cells of all higher organisms and in nearly every cell in the human body. When we suffer from jet lag, or work night shifts, we experience the negative effects of getting our cellular clocks out-of-synch with each other.

     Because the internal clock can be found in individual cells, we can use simple organisms to study it. We are using the fungus Neurospora crassa, a common bread mould, as a model organism to study the mechanism of the clock at the molecular and biochemical level. This fungus is easy to grow in the laboratory, and has been studied for more than 60 years, so we know a great deal about its biochemistry and genetics. We use mutant strains that have disrupted clocks, and we are studying the biochemistry of these mutant strains to try to determine why their clocks are disrupted. Other labs have identified a small number of genes that are important in the normal clock mechanism, but we have found that the fungus can still be rhythmic even when these genes are defective. We are using a mutant that has an abnormality in the synthesis of lipids, the fatty molecules that make the membranes around cells. When the level of a particular lipid, diacylglycerol, is high in the mutant, the fungus is rhythmic with a slow clock, even when other well-known clock genes are mutated. Diacylglycerol in known to be an important signalling molecule in animal cells, activating enzymes that control many cellular processes. We are looking at the effects of diacylglycerol on the signalling enzymes in Neurospora to try to understand how it affects the clock. This research may help us identify new components of the clockworks, and this can help us understand how the fungus, and possibly other organisms, use their biochemistry to tell time.

"Today's web search is confined to users submitting a keyword search query to a generic search engine and sifting through a large linearly ordered list of answers. While this is satisfactory for many purposes, it ignores the significant trends, spurred by the advent of Web 2.0, toward increased integration of content information that users search for and their social profiles (activities and connections), leading to social content sites. First, sites like del.icio.us and flickr started as social content sites: users can form social ties and tag content items and share them with their friends. Second, more and more, content-only sites like Amazon are now allowing users to tag/rate items and share them with their friends. Similarly, social sites like facebook are allowing users to share content with their friends. Third, there is a definite trend toward virtual social content sites: e.g., most news sites let users share news articles with their friends in, say MySpace. In all these social content sites -- virtual and real -- there is rich structured information on both content items and users as well on user-provided content. Treating social content sites the same way as any other site misses out on leveraging the significant content and social structure present in these sites. We envision a future where domain-specific social content sites will increasingly offer an attractive alternative for users compared to generic search engines. In this program, we will investigate the combination of techniques drawn from information retrieval style search, database style querying, recommender systems, social networks, graph modeling and querying, data analysis and data mining over rich social and content structure, and multi-dimensional querying and OLAP, to significantly enrich and advance user experience in interacting with collections of social content sites. Users will be able to seamlessly shift between heterogeneous groups of answers: these groups may consist of content items at various levels of granularity, or ""similar"" items which ""recommended"" those items, or ""similar"" or expert users who recommended the items and their tags/ratings, or other ""topics"" that may interest the user, leading to a powerful paradigm for information discovery.

"For many positive-strand RNA [(+) RNA] viruses, RNA replication occurs within cytoplasmic membranous vesicles. Over the past years, my research team has shown that the protein linked to the genome (VPg) of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) interacts with several virus and host proteins, notably translation factors. We have found that many of these interactions are taking place in replication vesicles induced by 6K-VPg-Pro, a precursor form of VPg. In this research proposal, I wish to extend our comprehension of the vesicles harbouring the virus replication complex. More specifically, I wish to elucidate their content and architecture and study their genesis and movement within the cell.



This proposal will explore the cellular biology of TuMV. It will use the most recent technologies for cellular visualisation and will provide not only information pertinent to potyvirus biology, but also to virology in general. The project will provide highly qualified personels (HQPs) with skills in molecular and cellular virology and plant biotechnology. The HQPs will develop a better understanding of viral replication: the role of viral proteins and their relationship with host proteins involved in RNA synthesis. They will acquire expertise in DNA recombinant technology, protein expression and confocal microscopy.

"The proposed program focuses on the design, optimization, fabrication and testing of flexible artificial biologically-inspired and biomimetic wings for application to micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) and insect flight studies.  Micro aerial vehicles are being considered for numerous applications in civil defence, critical infrastructure monitoring, disaster relief and environmental studies.  However, the development of efficient and functional MAVs is being held back in part by a lack of low cost fabrication techniques for the thin flexible multifunctional structures required for the flight surfaces.  One possible approach is to turn to nature for biologically-inspired and/or biomimetic solutions.  Using insect wings as a guide, novel composite materials and processing techniques will be developed to produce lightweight, multifunctional and low cost wings with high fidelity and repeatability.  These wings will be used in insect flight studies by the collaborators at Carleton University.  The artificial wings will also be compared to actual insect wings for their relative performance in terms of flexibility, lift coefficient and weight.  Three students will have the opportunity to work on this program to develop the processes and design solutions required for these novel structures.

"Number Theory is the study of questions related to the integral numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...



Two central questions in Number Theory are the resolution of equations involving integral (or rational) numbers, and the distribution of prime numbers (which are the building blocks of integral numbers). An example of the first question is the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, related to arithmetic of elliptic curves. The second question can be answered with high precision by proving the Riemann hypothesis about the distribution of the zeros of the Riemannn zeta function.



Note that these are two of the seven Millennial Problems of the Clay Institute, with a prize of one million US dollars each. Both problems have implications in other fields, like cryptography, for example. 



Our work relates some of the ingredients that compose both of these problems. In fact we obtain examples of conjectures that are generalizations of the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjectures for equations other than elliptic curves. Not much is known about these general conjectures, and even obtaining examples is a hard task. 

The examples also yield information about special values of the Riemann zeta function as well as its generalizations, L-functions.



We combine techniques from many areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, complex analysis, topology, graph theory, differential equations, etc.

"The continued growth of the Canadian (and global) population seems to disproportionately increase the demands on the nation's natural resources and ultimately results in the development greater quantities of waste byproducts. The reuse of biomass to generate a renewable energy source is of critical importance to the Canadian government, research sectors, inudstries, and the public because of our nation's commitment to Kyoto Protocol. The proposed research will investigate the conversion of feedstock chemical produced from agriculture residues and organic municipal waste to H2 and other carbon byproducts.  Hydrogen is a valuable energy source and a potential transportation fuel.  The carbon byproducts could be converted into H2 and CO2 in an electrochemically assisted bioreactor. Note the latter is beyond the scope of the proposed research work. Carbon dioxide can be captured for used in green-houses to enhance plant growth or alternatively used by algae to produce long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) for biodiesel production. In the 1st part of the proposed process, biomass is thermal treated to release valuable sugars and in a 2nd process, these sugars are fermented to produce H2 and carbon byproducts.","Alternative energy resources","Energy resources","Civil and Environmental Engineering","Lalman, Jerald","STPGP ","Chemical engineering","Chemical engineering","G�nie chimique",2-3
"Current research on microbial hydrogen production is focused on using pure and mixed cultures.  Studies with pure cultures have utilized sterile substrates to prevent contamination.  Substrate sterilization is a major disadvantage for processes using pure cultures.  Microbial cultures which are able to utilize non-sterile feedstocks could be more flexible and cost effective.  Low value agriculture residues such as corn stover and wheat stalks are possible sources of non-sterile feedstocks. Mixed cultures containing acidogens, acetogens and methanogens can consume sugars derived from low value agriculture residues.  However, a major concern related to sustained hydrogen production is the presence of hydrogen consuming organisms in mixed anaerobic communities.  The proposed research will focus on using long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) to inhibit the hydrogen consuming population.  The research plan provides an outline for investigating and developing an anaerobic process for producing hydrogen using low value agriculture agriculture residues.  The short-term objectives will identify environmental and process parameters affecting hydrogen production.  Batch studies will be conducted to examine the effect of several long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) on the fermentation of pentose and hexose sugars.  Adding LCFAs will be employed to increase hydrogen production by inactivating non-spore forming hydrogen consuming organisms and selecting the more favorable hydrogen producing bacteria in both batch and continuous flow studies.  The major thrust of the long-term objectives will focus on developing a sustainable continuous system to generate hydrogen.

The spontaneous autosomal recessive reeler mutation causes a disruption of the Reln gene, involved in neural development. The Reln-rl mutant mouse displays cell disorganization with preserved anatomical connections. 

We have evaluated the neurobehavioral consequences of Reln-rl (reeler) mutant mice in tests of exploratory activity, motor coordination, and spatial learning as well as regional brain metabolism and wish to extend this analysis to other mutants involved in the Reelin signaling pathway. For this purpose, scrambler mutant mice will be used, characterized by a deficient Dba1 gene, encoding Disabled-1, an adaptor protein, as well as null mutants for Vldlr and Apoer2 genes, encoding Reelin receptors on which Dba1 binds at the level of their cytoplasmic domains.

Adult mice will be evaluated in tests of exploratory activity, motor coordination, and spatial learning. Exploratory activity will be measured in T-maze, open-field, elevated plus-maze, and emergence tests. Motor coordination will be measured in stationary beam, suspended bar, and rotorod tests. Spatial learning will be measured in the Morris water maze. We will also evaluate the mice during early postnatal development in tests of basic neurologic function including sensorimotor coordination and reflexes.

The mice will be evaluated during development and adult periods for regional brain metabolism as assessed by cytochrome oxidase activity, a marker of neural activity. This high-resolution histochemical method permits the identification of over 200 brain regions. In Reln-rl and other mutants, cytochrome oxidase activity was linearly correlated with behavioral functions. In addition, the FluoroJade method will be used for identification of brain regions undergoing cell degeneration. By such means, we will establish the functional consequences of the Reelin signaling pathway.

The basic technique for enumerating combinatorial objects is a computer-aided backtrack search. Since the unsolved cases on partial geometries are too big to be attacked  directly, I will use the technique of assuming an automorphism in order to reduce the size of the problem.



These problems have been long outstanding. Their solution would lead to better  understanding of the object and to better computational methods.

"The objective of this research program is to develop fundamental understanding and analytical tools to study the reliability of woodframe and post & beam building systems under seismic loading.



Reliability based assessment as a means to define the performance of timber structures is a goal recognized by design code committees worldwide.  Its application is particularly suited to timber structures under earthquake loadings as the material properties of the timber, the seismic event, and the generated lateral forces are highly random.  



The proposed work will focus on the development of a database to study the performance and damage of more realistic taller and irregular timber buildings including: 1) the ""stiffness"" of floor (with perforations) and roof diaphragms; 2) the performance of taller walls with or without perforations; and 3) the 3-dimensional structural behaviour of full size taller structures.  Models linking the semi-rigid diaphragm to the UBC pseudo nail wall analysis tool will be developed; the model will be calibrated and verified against test data, and reliability assessment on the seismic response of more realistic structures will be conducted by using either a fragility or response surface approach.

"Embedded systems are omnipresent, from consumer applications like microwave ovens and automotive control systems, to safety-critical industrial systems for factory automation and avionics. As the reach of embedded systems continues to grow, developers will require better tools for embedded systems software development.



Embedded hardware and software development requires specialized equipment.  We are requesting demonstration equipment and embedded systems development stations, which will let us run simulations and study tools for creating better embedded software and hardware.  This proposal will support practical research in dependable embedded systems development by providing equipment which will enable our research teams to carry out experiments proving our theories and concepts.  For instance, the hardware will provide platforms for us to investigate software abstractions for background/foreground systems as well as complex embedded operating systems (including the eCos and embedded Linux operating systems). We also intend to conduct research in semantics-preserving parallelization of hardware designs for high performance simulation using a Graphics Processing Unit platform.



The equipment will be used by the PI and co-PIs in their joint embedded systems laboratory. It will serve twelve PhD and MASc students and provide the necessary equipment for their studies and training.

"Software systems are notoriously difficult to get right. A key problem is that it is difficult to state just what it means for a software system to be ""right"" in the first place: while it is easy to point out particular undesired behaviours, particularly crashes, it is difficult to specify a software system's desired behaviours.



The first part of my research programme therefore aims to develop new techniques for software developers to specify the behaviour of their systems. I am particularly interested in lightweight specifications, which concentrate on a particular aspect of a system's behaviour. I believe that their tight focus will make lightweight specifications much easier to work with than general-purpose specifications: focussed properties will be easier to state and to understand. To provide an initial set of specifications for already-existing software systems, I will also develop tools for automatically extracting specifications from software systems.



Of course, software users would just like their software to work; they don't care that it has been specified. Hence, the second part of my research programme will develop techniques and tools that enable developers to verify that their software systems actually satisfy their specifications. My expertise in developing program analysis tools and techniques will enable me to develop novel techniques for verifying my proposed lightweight specifications.

"We know from personal experience how easy it is for us to adapt and walk through different environments. We will encounter innumerable types of walking environments and need to cope with changes to the physical properties of our bodies throughout life. How does our nervous system deal with these ever changing demands to ensure that we can move accurately and safely? One idea is that the nervous system takes into account the physical properties of our legs and the surrounding environment in order to produce appropriate adjustments during walking. The long-term goal of my research program is to understand how these neural commands are used to control walking. The short-term goal of my research over the next 5 years is to examine the extent to which these neural commands are transferable across different walking conditions and tasks. A key approach to this research will be to use a robotic gait device (the Lokomat) to generate novel force field environments during walking. Subjects will be trained to walk in these Lokomat-generated environments. Adaptation patterns will be tracked by recordings of leg muscle activity (electromyography) and movement patterns. It is hypothesized that once the nervous system has adapted to the novel force field it can readily transfer this adaptation to other situations. The ability of subjects to transfer adaptations to different walking tasks (e.g. different directions, different speeds) or to transfer adaptations from one leg to the other will be tested. Other experiments proposed here will investigate the role that areas of the brain important for the control of movement are involved in this adaptation process. These investigations will use a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation to temporarily influence neural activity and to examine its effects on walking adaptations. In this research program, a unique approach to studying human walking will be pursued in order to further our basic conceptual knowledge of how the nervous system is able to adapt and cope with the myriad of walking conditions encountered in everyday life.

"Virus infections remain a major health concern worldwide. There is an urgent need for more and better vaccines against a number of human and animal viral infections. Interestingly, most of the available effective vaccines protect through the production of antibodies. However, the mechanisms by which antibodies are efficiently generated and confer protection remain poorly understood. Some virus infections trigger a rapid and efficient antibody response whereas others only induce poor and late responses. We are studying the molecular mechanisms involved in the efficient production of antibodies of high quality that can confer protection against virus infections. This research program will thus aim at identifying the reasons for the poor ability of persisting viruses to induce neutralizing antibodies and ways to improve their immunogenicity. The results from this study will help to improve the design of more effective vaccines against important human viral infections like those caused by HCV and HIV.

"My research program will examine the mechanisms that structure the composition and diversity of plant communities, with an emphasis on the community consequences of plant - soil interactions. My research combines the power of innovative experimental designs with statistical advances to understand the mechanisms structuring plant communities. Using these approaches my lab has the potential to make significant contributions to the field of plant community ecology.

     My Discovery funded research program will focus on two major topics important to understanding the community consequences of plant-soil relationships: 1) the role of the soil microbial community in the network of interactions that structure plant community composition and diversity, and 2) the relationship between the diversity of plant root communities and their associated soil microbial communities. We will use the effects of experimental fire and grazing on fescue grasslands as a model system to study plant - soil relationships. Currently we know how individual components of this system interact, but not how the entire system holistically responds. We will use statistical techniques such as structural equation modeling to disentangle the role of plant - soil microbial interactions in the network of ecological mechanisms governing plant community recovery. An empirical synthesis of the roles of environmental, plant community, and microbial community processes is a crucial step in the development of a general theoretical understanding of the mechanisms structuring plant community diversity and composition.

     Over the next five years, I propose to train one M.Sc. and one Ph.D. student along with 5 undergraduate students in plant community ecology and plant - soil relationships. These students will help me to analyze how burning and grazing influences the soil microbial community and how this in turn, influences future plant community structure. These students will have exceptional opportunities for training in both field ecology and molecular methods, providing them with skills likely to be in high demand.

"Billions of dollars have been spent on the control of nutrient loading to Lake Erie in the U.S. and Canada with the elimination of deep water hypoxia (low oxygen levels) in the central basin of the lake an important goal. In spite of improvements in chlorophyll and phosphorus levels in offshore lake waters, hypoxia appears to have worsened in recent years. There are several hypotheses for the cause of this, including changing climatic conditions, changes in nutrient input from rivers, and the effects of non-native mussels which invaded Lake Erie in the 1980s.

Deep water hypoxia occurs in the lower layer of the lake, called the hypolimnion, which lies beneath a thin layer of rapid temperature change with depth called the metalimnion. The metalimnion represents a barrier for the downward flux of oxygen. In recent years it has become appreciated that breaking internal waves in the metalimnion are an important mechanism for this downward flux. This is one of several ways in which physical processes in the lake have an impact on biological and chemical processes.

In this research data will be used to validate a lake-scale hydrodynamic-biogeochemical numerical model which will then be used to demonstrate the implications of current hypotheses and to explore the possible implications of future climate change scenarios. In order to elucidate the role of breaking internal waves in the thermocline a field program will be conducted to obtain data with high temporal and spatial resolution. This will be the first such study in Lake Erie. Physical, chemical and biological measurements will be made enabling links between various processes to be made and to establish their role in the formation of hypoxic water. Lake-scale and high-resolution numerical simulations will be undertaken to provide a fuller picture of these important processes. This research will result in a synthesized picture of the role of large and small scale processes in the formation of deep water hypoxia and provide useful tools for the future management of this important lake, tools which can also be applied to other lakes.

"Lakes, the oceans and the atmosphere are all density stratified fluids. In lakes the stratification is most often due to temperature variations, with cold dense water lying beneath lighter, warm surface waters. Sometimes the presence of salts can contribute to the stratification. In the ocean variations in both temperature and salinity are important.  One consequence of the stratification is the presence of internal gravity waves which are ubiquitous in the interior of lakes, oceans and the atmosphere. These waves are driven by gravitational restoring forces acting on vertically displaced fluids. At the surface of lakes and oceans, surface water waves are found. Here gravitational restoring forces as well as surface tension forces come in to play. Surface tension significantly modifies the properties of surface waves at length scales less than a few centimeters.



The proposed research focusses on three interconnected projects related to internal waves and surface waves. Ongoing research into the generation of internal waves in the deep ocean and on the generation, evolution and fate of large amplitude, nonlinear internal solitary waves in the coastal ocean will be continued. Mixing associated with these waves has implications ranging from our climate to biological processes. Microscale breaking surface water waves are waves which, because of surface tension effects, break without entraining air. They are common at low wind speeds and significantly modify air-sea gas and heat fluxes. A novel numerical model will be developed, enabling high-resolution simulations of these waves which will lead to an improved understanding of their implications for air-sea gas and heat exchange. The final project is the development of an unstructured grid numerical hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model that can be used to model physical processes in lakes with complicated geometries such as those found on the Canadian Shield. This model will be used to explore a range of issues, from internal wave processes to water quality problems.

"Persistent network activity is thought to form the cellular basis of working memory - the mental ""scratch pad"" which we use to manipulate concepts and to compare incoming information with that stored in long term memory. This cognitive function is disrupted by stress through mechanisms that are not well understood. Since network activity may be fundamental for cognitive function, certain aspects of the mechanisms underlying this network activity are the focus of many recent studies. However, little is known about how network activity is modulated by second messenger systems. The cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, are second messengers that play a major role in the central nervous system and are a point of convergence and cross talk among many different neurotransmitter systems. This research will improve our understanding of the cortical mechanisms by which stress affects cognition and emotional behaviour.

"Nitroaromatic, nitroheterocyclic and nitropolyaromatic compounds are examples of nitrosubstituted compounds (NSCs) that are important genotoxic components of complex matrices such as contaminated soil.  Our work over the next five years will examine the genomics of the microbial communities in contaminated soils that degrade NSCs, and will characterize the enzymes responsible for biotransformation of NSCs.



1) CHARACTERIZATION OF NITROREDUCTASES.  Nitroreductses (NRs) are a group of enzymes that initiate the degradation of NSCs in bacteria.  They are important not only because of their role in biodegradation but also because the intermediates of metabolism are capable of interacting with biological macromolecules, and are responsible for the observed genotoxic and antimicrobial activity of NSCs.  Our studies will characterize NRs from a range of bacteria in order to  more completely understand a) the structural properties of NRs that are important for substrate specificity; and b) the relationships between NRs from different phylogenetic groups.



2) GENOMICS OF CONTAMINATED SOILS.  Our objective in this part of the project will be to identify soil bacteria that contribute to NSC transformation, and also to identify novel pathways that may play a role in NSC transformation.  Since only a small proportion of the microbial population (~1%) is culturable by standard methods, we will focus on the soil metagenome that represents the DNA content of all microbes in the soil.  Microbial diversity of contaminated soils will be determined by molecular methods and this information will help us design PCR primers for the isolation of genes encoding NRs.  In addition we will attempt to identify novel genes associated with NSC degradation using a substrate induced gene expression screen (SIGEX), which is designed to isolate elements that are unregulated by specific NSC compounds or mixtures.

"The proposed research program aims to apply operations research methodologies to some production management problems encountered in energy planning and flexible manufacturing where randomness is present, using a blend of analytical and statistical techniques, numerical methods and Monte Carlo simulations.



In energy planning, we are interested in methods for computation of optimal operating rules for reservoir systems used for producing hydroelectricity over a planning horizon of several years. We are interested in mathematical models of reservoirs with random inflows. In a first approximation, we would analyze models of two reservoirs in series with concave reward functions by neglecting turbine head variations. In a second stage, we will examine how the head variations affect the shape of optimal operating rules. In a third stage, we will use simulation studies to assess the value of more detailed hydrologic information in an optimization model as well as robustness of computed operating rules with respect to forecast errors and climate change.



Current trends in flexible manufacturing are to increase the level of automation in production facilities. In this context, the presence of randomness in the economic life of cutting tools poses some interesting problems in terms of monitoring tool condition and minimizing the need for unplanned human intervention. We will study a dynamic, stochastic optimization model for allocating tool magazine capacity and selecting cutting speed for an automated machine tool, and we will investigate the mathematical properties of optimal solutions.

Understanding these methods is crucial in order to exploit the power of new sensor technologies in manufacturing systems.

"In this research project, I will investigate how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) techniques can contribute to the development of decision modules for dynamic game environments. My objectives are a) to determine the potential benefits of using CBR techniques for capturing and reusing game episodes, b) to study how CBR techniques can contribute to the development of interesting and efficient game AI decision schemes, and c) to address technical limitations of current CBR techniques to make them more suitable for dynamic and uncertain environments like real-time games.  

     Current technologies for implementing nonplayer characters (NPC) in games mostly rely on finite state machines (FSM), a static structure that can be quite extensive and difficult to edit for complex games. We believe that CBR, exploited as a dynamic decision scheme, can significantly contribute to game development by facilitating the design of elaborate behaviours. CBR consists of reusing past experiences to solve new problems. For this project, we foresee CBR as a mean to efficiently store and encode game episodes that can be reused for player modeling or behaviour cloning. However, to be exploited by a CBR system, episodes have to be properly encoded and stored in a case base. Due to the sequential nature of games, some issues have to be tackled for the structuring of the episodes. Technical issues to be addressed in this project are :

   - how to conduct sequences of decisions using CBR;

   - how to adapt the reasoning cycle to different decision timelines; and 

   - how to take into account implicit interactions with human players. 

     This proposal builds on a research effort we are conducting with some industrial partners and is an initiative to investigate longer term issues to be addressed in support of this collaboration.

"The specific objectives of this project are  a) to test the luminescence dating method on Middle to Late Pleistocene loess from Yukon and b) to contribute to the science of Climate Change in the Arctic. Yukon is part of Eastern Beringia, home of one the most extensive and comprehensive loess-tephra lithostratigraphic assemblage of the world. Loess is perfectly suited for luminescence dating, and as such, the Yukon river sections and mining exposure constitute a perfect laboratory to test the feldspar DRC method, a new dating technique developed in Montr�al.



The areas that will be visited in the course of this research program are: Dawson City and Klondike Placer Mining District and the Old Crow area, including the Flats and the Ch'ijee's Bluff, along the Porcupine River. This contribution is to be integrated inside a common research strategy of understanding climate changes and the mechanism of its impact in Western and Northern Yukon. This project will be carried out in collaboration with the Vuntut Gwitch'in Tribal Council.



This research program should contribute to the investigation of this very critical issue of the stability of permafrost at the end of the Last Interglacial. There are a large number of buried thermokarstic features that are presumably related to the intense melting at the end of the regional Koy-Yukon warm event (125 000 years ago), an analogue for the modeling of the apprehended increased warming in the Arctic. This activity will strengthen the Canadian research presence in the Arctic, in full agreement with the recently announced Canadian scientific policies. The IPCC (2007) assessment report have highlighted the climate emergency in the Arctic, as enhanced feedback seems to promote much higher temperature increases in the North, and hence dangers to the infrastructure and to the local communities.

"We are developing a research program in computational enzymology. Computational enzymology is the study of enzymes and the biochemical reactions they catalyze using computer simulations. At present time, the only methods for simulating enzymatic reactions that are sufficiently accurate to reveal the real mechanism of an enzyme require weeks, if not months of calculation on a supercomputer. Our objective is to develop new methods that allow the same simulations to be performed in a few hours, and that enable computational studies at a much larger scale.

    We will initially focus on metalloenzymes, which are proteins that get their biochemical activity from binding a metal atom such as zinc or magnesium. Metalloenzymes are involved in numerous biological functions such as respiration, digestion, tissue growth, and blood-pressure regulation, and are prime therapeutic targets. Some metalloenzyme inhibitors are efficient drugs against hypertension, HIV/AIDS, and cancer.

    First, we will accurately simulate various classes of chemical reactions found in metalloenzymes. The resulting data, generated once and for all, will then be represented with simple yet realistic mathematical models that will allow to simulate and compare the mechanisms of a large number of metalloenzymes with diverse biological functions. We are interested in answering the following questions: Why is a given metalloenzyme more active for a certain metal than for another? In enzymes containing more than one metal atom in their active site, what is the role of each? Which motions of the enzyme are important for its activity? Can these movements be inhibited using a small molecule? In the short term, our work will help to understand the molecular details of numerous catalytic mechanisms. In the long term, it will help to decode the function of an enzyme from its three-dimensional structure, to develop new inhibitors, and to reduce the side effects of already existing inhibitors.

"Our research programs are focused on the interpretation of annually layered lake sediment records to reconstruct long term climatological and hydrological change in the Canadian High Arctic and elsewhere.  This work has generated important insights into the long term record of climate variability to put recent changes in context, and has identified processes that contribute to natural climate variability.  These lake records have also been incorporated into international syntheses of Arctic climate change to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that drive long term climate change accross the Arctic.



We have undertaken intensive river and lake sediment studies to further refine these sedimentary interpretations, and have developed novel new measures to interpret other information from the sedimentary record, including variations in geochemistry and sediment grain size.  Quantifying the processes and signals contained in these new measures requires detailed lake sedimentation field studies, and in particular, understanding how climate and hydrological processes are reflected in sediment deposition.  A core element of our collaborative and individual research programs is the measurement of sediment inflows and deposition in lakes.  To proceed with this research we require a submersible acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) for measuring low velocity sediment inflows at the lake bottom in order to identify processes that link sediment inflows to deposition and advance our interpretation of fine structural and geochemical details in the sedimentary record.  



The proposed research instrument and integrated research objectives will allow us to make significant knowledge advances, provide substantial training opportunities with cutting-edge techniques and equipment, and generate an unprecedented understanding of the sedimentary record for paleoclimatic purposes.

"This research program will develop a comprehensive understanding of the factors that control permafrost disturbances and their effects on sediment erosion and water quality in Arctic rivers.  This information will be vital for planning appropriate Arctic land management objectives, establishing environmental baselines for development, and provide key contributions to studies of related terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem response to climate change.

  These research objectives will be reached primarily by carrying out an innovative, integrated field program at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), Melville Island, Nunavut, that will provide extensive training and field experience for students and a postdoctoral researcher.  The research team will investigate the weather, landscape and vegetation controls over the location and form of permafrost disturbances.  Localized sediment and carbon erosion in streams from surfaces subject to different extent and age of permafrost disturbance will be studied, and scaled up to identify the downstream impact of localized disturbance on sediment transport and water quality.  These impacts will be further investigated in downstream lakes, through detailed characterization of sediment and particulate carbon deposition, and the resulting sedimentary deposits.  Accurate characterization of deposits formed by recent disturbances will allow the reconstruction of past landscape disruptions from annually-layered lake sediments for 1000+ years at multiple locations in the Canadian Arctic in order to understand how climate changes influence permafrost landscape stability. 

  Arctic regions are currently warming at rapid rates, and projections indicate significant changes in permafrost and sediment erosion will occur.  The proposed research will determine landscape controls over permafrost disturbance, provide the knowledge to interpret the water quality impacts of disturbances, and provide a long term perspective to evaluate timescales for land stabilization.

"Ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless transmission collectively refers to a class of radios using signals with an extremely large bandwidth. While UWB has been around since the beginning of all wireless communications at around 1900, it was especially after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's ruling in 2002, which allowed license-free operation of UWB radios, that UWB has been considered as promising physical-layer technology for a manifold of future communication networks. This is because of several features unique to UWB, such as low power and power-spectral density of the transmit signal, high resolution of multipath fading, and low-cost implementation. The huge interest in UWB communication technology is evident from the many major industrial players being involved in the standardization process and the numerous special issues in IEEE journals, as well as IEEE conferences dedicated to UWB. In this project, we will tackle a number of fundamental problems and design challenges that need to be solved before the full potential of UWB can be realized. We will focus on impulse-radio UWB (IR-UWB), which is the original flavor of UWB and the preferred solution for applications with stringent cost, complexity, and energy constraints, as encountered in communication networks for e.g. distributed control, environmental monitoring, tracking, resource management etc. Our research will be directed towards intelligent signal processing algorithms that enable (1) spectrally agile (cognitive) UWB devices for peaceful coexistence with incumbent services, (2) cooperative transmission for efficient communication in UWB networks, (3) high-precision ranging for location-based network applications, and (4) low-complexity modulation and robust detection for UWB transceivers. We have partnered with several industry collaborators in this project, who have a keen interest in exploiting IR-UWB technology to enhance and diversify their products in various markets. The technology transfer to them and other Canadian companies will further be facilitated by testbed and hardware implementation of new signal processing algorithms undertaken within this project.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Lampe, Lutz","STPGP ","Wireless communication systems","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",2-3

"This project proposes to validate a novel microclimate cooling strategy based on the employment of the large latent heat of water evaporation using membrane evaporation technology, which involves a special category of hydrophobic membranes that do not allow liquid water to penetrate its pores when the trans-membrane pressure is lower than its liquid entry pressure. Under controlled conditions, evaporation of water takes place atthe liquid-vapour interface in membrane pores with cooled water staying on the liquid side of the membrane and vapours escaping into the environment. Membrane can thus provide the surface for and the control of waterevaporation, which mimics the function of skin in sweating.        The proposed research study in a broad perspective will promote and support the development of unique research activities that will lead to the development of technological solutions to reduce environmental liabilities and improve worker health and safety in industry. To our best knowledge, no previous studies have examined the use of controlled membrane evaporation in microclimate cooling systems.  The proposed research program will therefore create significant new and innovative research opportunities that will help to fill a significant gap in this area of study.  From a practical perspective, our study program, with the support of our industrial partner Med-Eng Systems Inc., will ultimately lead to the development of a commercially competitive portable microclimate cooling system for civilian and military applications. For example, this technology will help to improve the health, safety, and work performance of personnel to work in hot environments (e.g. deep mine workers), to wear semi-permeable or impermeable protective clothing (e.g. chemical spilling cleanup workers and soldiers and personnel in bio/chemical defence), and/or to wear heavy armouring clothing (e.g. soldiers demining mine fields).","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","Chemical and Biological Engineering","Lan, Christopher","CHRPJ ","Biomedical technology","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",3-3
"My NSERC-supported research contributes to the study of some modeling ordinary differential equations and some second order elliptic inequalities. These modeling equations arise from mechanics, biomechanics and fluid dynamics. For example, they include singular second order ordinary differential equations describing the large deflection membrane response of a spherical cap; higher order ordinary differential equations describing the lateral bending of  human spine under muscle forces and other transverse loads; the Falkner-Skan equation arising in boundary layer theory and describing the steady two-dimensional flow of a slightly viscous incompressible fluid past wedge shaped bodies. A new theory of variational inequalities will be established in order to give a partial answer to an open question in the field of partial differential inequalities.

  The research is of importance in applications. For example, our study on the Falkner-Skan equation is of importance in separation theory of aeronautics because separation of the boundary layer can destroy the bound vortex on lifting bodies such as airfoils.

  The methodologies will include some new singular integral methods, iterative techniques, rigorous analytical techniques and variational approaches. Some softwares like Maple will be applied in the research. These new integral methods can be used to treat some other applied problems like beam models and  the new theory of variational inequalities has potential applications to optimization, control problems and game theory.

  The proposed research contributes significantly to the training and development of highly qualified personnel.

"Many physical systems (aircraft, violins, oceans, vibrators, skyscrapers, etc.) have oscillatory behaviour in some form.  This behaviour may be beneficial, harmless, or catastrophic depending on the applied loads and the environment. However, mathematical models which are used to analyse vibrations have certain common features and, particularly in the regime of small vibrations, linear models achieve extraordinary success in the prediction and modification of oscillations. Theories

have evolved over a period of about 300 years, but new mathematical and computational techniques have developed explosively in the last 50 years. My research has been 

focussed mainly on this problem area, and particularly on control and stability of vibrating systems with their associated computational problems.

"The space between the stars of the Milky Way is threaded by magnetic energy that plays a significant role in the never-ending cycle of star birth and star death. The best way to detect, measure, and visualize the invisible magnetic energy is through observations with radio telescopes because the fields influence the generation and propagation of radio waves in interstellar space. The quantity that must be measured is the polarization of the incoming radio signals, a preferred orientation of the waves. 



The technical challenges of imaging the polarized sky have been met with the DRAO Synthesis Telescope and with ""big-dish"" radio telescopes. A new image, the largest polarization survey ever, is now ready as a resource for a deep investigation of the role of magnetic fields in shaping the Milky Way.

 

A new series of observations with big-dish telescopes in the Northern and Southern hemispheres is underway. Enabled by new signal processing technology, these observations will yield new answers on the role of magnetic fields, and will provide an essential foundation for highly detailed work with the large radio telescopes that are now on the drawing board.



Arriving from all directions is the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, a relic of the Big Bang and of the early development of the Universe. Over recent years we have learnt much from investigating this very faint radio signal. We see this signal through the ""foreground"" of the Milky Way, and to make progress in our understanding of the early days of the Universe we must learn how to subtract Milky Way signals from the faint whisper of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. The research outlined in this proposal will advance this important endeavour.

"Quantification risk management is a key component of a financial toolkit developed to assist insurance companies in their aim to maintain a sound financial situation. An appropriate quantification of the risks associated with a particular block of insurance business necessitates the use of complex mathematical models that incorporate a multitude of factors that may influence (in a direct or indirect way) the claim experience of an insurance company. 



Over the last decade, the development of mathematical tools and the advances in computational capacity have permitted the quantitative analysis of more complex mathematical models, leading to a set of more realistic processes that are available to the insurance community to better understand the risks related to their business. Among the quantitative risk measures available, there are different quantities related to the event of ruin where ruin is defined to occur if and when the insurer has insufficient capital to meet its financial obligations. Indeed, the time at which ruin may be expected to occur, the amount of funds that may be expected to be available at the time of ruin, as well as the expected shortfall when and if ruin occurs are only few examples.



My proposed research consists in examining these complex mathematical models in light of the aforementioned quantities of interest for the insurers. The mathematical concepts required to perform this analysis alluded to above are numerous and are expected to increase in number and in complexity in the future.

"Management decision making in fisheries, oceans, and aquaculture has generally not adopted an integrated and structured approach to problem solving. A fundamental change is needed whereby problem solving is strategic with clearly defined objectives, quantitative evaluation of options and monitoring of performance. This research consolidates work on problem solving in the management of fisheries, oceans, and aquaculture. Research themes include the importance of viewing complex marine problems as a ""system"" requiring a multidisciplinary approach, and developing tools for integrated management. The focus of this research is on the state of Canada's oceans with application to the Atlantic Ocean. 

The long-term objective of this research is to categorize structured and integrated problem solving approaches to operational and strategic issues in the fisheries, oceans, and aquaculture. This approach is highlighted by the fundamental principles that arise in problem situations in this environment, namely, space-time considerations, quasi-property rights to users, shared responsibility and authority, and multidisciplinary decision support with focus on problem resolution. The research categorizes problems in fisheries, oceans, and aquaculture, and examines past, present, and future decisions to characterize the extent by which the fundamental principles apply and are taken (or not) into account in management decisions. The methodology for this research comes from the scientific method of problem solving in the field of operational research. This research extends the ongoing work of the applicant toward improving management of Canada's fisheries and oceans through integrated analysis of the complex ecosystem and human systems.

The research provides a rich background for the development of knowledge capacity for future problem solvers in oceans. The accelerated loss of expertise in oceans know-how in Canada is alarming. This work will expose highly qualified personnel to an area of applied management crucial to Canada and will provide training and experience in integrated systems analysis, problem solving and decision support.

"The research proposed here is important for understanding the role that viruses play in the movement of genetic material between cells.  This phenomenon of genetic exchange has significant consequences for the current state of life on Earth.  It is a major mechanism by which bacteria change their genetic makeup.  It may turn out to be important for higher organisms as well.  To address these larger questions, I use a specific model system, the Gene Transfer Agent of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus.  This model microbiological system is amenable to many essential molecular genetic techniques, facilitating this research and making it a suitable study system.  The short-term goal of this research is to characterize how one virus-like gene transfer system functions, and to assess the prevalence of this and related systems in natural environments.  Understanding the Gene Transfer Agent is an important and realistic step towards determining the prevalence and importance of virus-mediated gene transfer, the long-term goal of this research.  This research uses modern techniques in the areas of microscopy, genetics and bioinformatics.  The knowledge gained from study of this specific system falls within the general category of bacterial genetics, but the research aims to ultimately address the larger global involvement of viruses in gene flow.  This research will contribute to our understanding of microbial genetics and diversity.  It will also benefit Canada through the training of students and scientists who can then use their training for careers in health sciences, industry or academics.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Biology,"Lang, Andrew","RGPIN ",Microbiology,Microbiology,Microbiologie,3-5
"This proposal describes a research program which will investigate and develop novel methods for the acquisition of physical models of our environment. Increasingly, consumer applications on game consoles to cell phones utilize 3D models because of the ubiquity of performance graphics hardware. The computational power in displaying 3D models is currently not supported by an efficient process to acquire these physical models. Automatic model acquisition methods are often still too cumbersome, too specific and their results are hard to control. Most models to date are created by artists. Artistic modelling is suitable for characters in entertainment, games and advertising, but is inefficient for large-scale models and does not result in accurate physical models.

My goal is to ease the acquisition of computational 3D models by integrating the human modeller into an interactive measurement-based process. Interactive methods allow direct human control of the acquisition process which will make the results of the measurement-based acquisition process predictable. Measurements of the physical world will lead to realistic models of our environment. Although 3D models are concerned with shape, the growing demand for high-quality images, animations and multimodal display requires that physical parameters are acquired as well. I propose to conduct research into interactive acquisition of 3D shape, physics-based deformable models and appearance models applied to virtual training environments, navigation and entertainment. Real-time interactive acquisition will greatly simplify 3D physical modelling and make it available to the non-expert.

"    )	My overall research interests lie within the field of insect neurobiology/physiology.  I am interested in the means by which the reproductive system, and indeed, other insect visceral muscle systems, are regulated and integrated by both neural and hormonal signals.  To this end my research laboratory has developed model systems in which we have identified the motor and modulatory input onto tissues associated with the reproductive systems of the agricultural pest, Locusta migratoria, and in the medically-important vector of Chagas' disease, Rhodnius prolixus.  Neuroactive substances have been identified associated with the innervation of the reproductive system and have also been shown to be associated with the digestive and the circulatory system. There is an integral link between these systems since the nutritional state of the insect influences the reproductive state, and the heart circulates nutrient and neurohormones throughout the insect.

    )	Our research concentrates on four main areas: 1) integrative control of reproductive structures (oviducts, spermatheca, testes, and oviposition muscles) in Locusta and Rhodnius; 2) integrative control of the digestive tract, involving neuromodulators and midgut endocrine cells; 3) integrative control of microcirculation of haemolymph and neurohormones; and 4) molecular characterization of G-protein coupled receptors and their ligands (peptides and amines) associated with these visceral systems.

    )	The integrative activities of peptide and amine neurotransmitters and neurohormones are fundamental to the biology of all regulatory systems throughout the animal kingdom.  Many neuroendocrine/modulatory processes display features which make them amenable for modification for pest control.  Physiology may serve to rationalize existing procedures or discover new areas of attack against an insect pest.  Therefore, a study of the physiology of insects can furnish the means of controlling insect pests by the development of new pest control agents.

"The coordination of aerosol drug delivery with the breathing pattern of individual patients is one of the greatest challenges in developing the next generation of smart aerosol delivery devices. Accurate numerical simulation of aerosol deposition is essential for the optimal design and development of these new devices. The presently existing deposition models cannot capture the effect of transient breathing pattern and cannot predict the time dependent local deposition rates. The goal of this project is to develop novel deposition functions for the instantaneous, transient deposition rate of aerosol particles. 



The research will start with the development of new analytical deposition functions on highly simplified geometries to obtain functional forms that can be used in realistic flows. To adapt the analytical functions to realistic geometries, such as the mouth-throat and lung bifurcations, a novel experimental system will be developed. The working principle of this validation experiment is based on measuring electrical charge accumulation at surfaces to obtain the deposition rate of particles previously charged with a known unit charge. This setup will be the first of its kind to enable real-time measurement of local deposition rate of aerosol particles with high accuracy. An important feature of this experimental setup will be its ability to measure instantaneous local deposition rate at multiple locations simultaneously. 



The outcome of this research will greatly advance our ability to understand and to predict transient deposition rates of aerosols in different regions of lungs. This will help development of the next generation of smart nebulizers, which will offer a more efficient and better controlled, targeted delivery of drugs in human airways.

"Lors de nos activit�s quotidiennes, nous accomplissons des actions et soumettons notre corps � des contraintes m�caniques pouvant induire la d�gradation des tissus conjonctifs mous (TCM), notamment les tendons, ligaments et fascias. Les tissus endommag�s sont remodel�s et r�par�s par les cellules qu'ils contiennent. Toutefois, si la d�gradation d�passe la capacit� de gu�rison, l'�quilibre structural est menac�. Ce ph�nom�ne simple pourrait expliquer en partie la progression des l�sions caus�es par des mouvements r�p�titifs. Par mes recherches, je vise � mieux conna�tre la physiologie et la pathologie des TCM. J'�tudierai la m�canobiologie de ces tissus, c.-�-d. leur r�ponse � des stimuli m�caniques, plus sp�cifiquement, la dynamique comp�titive d�gradation/r�paration

     L'�tude de cette dynamique est toutefois complexe. En effet, l'�quilibre structural et l'�volution temporelle des tissus sous chargement m�canique seraient r�gis par une boucle de r�troaction (un m�canisme de r�gulation). Pour ajouter � la complexit�, cette boucle serait affect�e par diff�rents facteurs individuels, environnementaux ou encore associ�s � l'activit�. Bien que cette boucle ait une influence majeure sur la physiologie, la pathologie et la gu�rison des tissus conjonctifs mous, elle n'est encore qu'au stade de concept dans la litt�rature. Par ce projet, je propose une premi�re caract�risation de la boucle et l'investigation de l'effet de l'alimentation, de l'�ge et de l'�tat du tissu sur ce m�canisme de r�gulation.

     La m�canobiologie des TCM rev�t une grande importance car elle apportera de nouvelles pistes pour am�liorer les strat�gies de pr�vention et de r�adaptation associ�es aux troubles musculo-squelettique TMS tels les tendinoses. Ces nouvelles strat�gies sont essentielles � l'am�lioration de la sant� et de la qualit� de vie des Canadiens, mais elles auront aussi un impact �conomique important. Une meilleure compr�hension des processus de l�sions et de gu�rison permettra d'am�liorer la gestion de certaines affections musculo-

squelettiques qui, dans l'ensemble, repr�senteraient un fardeau pour le Canada de plus de 16 milliards $.

"In the study of systems of mathematical equations, Bifurcation Theory explains how small changes in the parameters of the equations can lead to disproportionate changes in the solutions of the equations.  Bifurcation Theory tells us that this ""cause and effect"" relationship is not arbitrary, but is most likely to occur only in a few typical (or generic) ways, called bifurcations, which mathematicians are beginning to understand fairly well.  In the present work, the equations under study are nonlinear systems of differential equations;  that is, equations that determine how a system evolves with time.   Equations of this kind are widely used in science, and help in the understanding of many kinds of real systems, for example in physics, engineering and biology.  



This research program has two objectives.  In the field of mathematics, it will contribute to the growth of Bifurcation Theory, by adding new types of bifurcations to the knowledge base.  Outside of mathematics, this research program will advance the application of ideas of Bifurcation Theory to real-world systems, with the goal of better understanding how these systems are likely to change.  Some examples of the systems currently under investigation from this perspective are:  global climate change, patterns of vibrations in heat exchanger arrays (as found in nuclear reactors), onset of certain cardio-respiratory diseases in humans, and sustainable biodiversity in ecology.

Currently, the dominant Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) paradigm capitalizes on pairs of sequences of words, namely phrases. Despite its success, phrase-based SMT has several well-understood shortcomings among which: no (or little) syntactical or semantic sensitivity, bad generalization capabilities, and a strong dependency on large parallel data. This severely limits in practice the deployment of SMT as a standalone technology. In this NSERC Research Program, I want to tackle these limitations by investigating three avenues.

 

In the first theme, I will investigate ways of building translation engines based on dependency n-grams: a head word (called governor) and the set of its dependents in a sentence, as identified by a dependency parser (DP) or a comparable device. DP-ns have several advantages over standard phrases including a better compromise between lexical expressiveness and generalization power.



The second theme of this research proposal is intended to solve part of a key challenge in the MT community: demonstrating that semantic information benefits SMT. As intuitive as this might appear, we have yet to demonstrate this empirically.



The third and last avenue pursued in this proposal is the one of alleviating the strong dependency current SMT technology has on the availability of parallel training material. Parallel corpus enrichment as well as improved parallel data mining will be investigated.

"The proposed research program centres on the development and assessment of techniques and algorithms for positioning and navigation using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS - including the U.S. Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS); the Russian GLONASS system; and Galileo, the European system now under development) and is a continuation of my NSERC-supported research in this field. The work over the next five years will be targeted to significantly improve the performance of real-time, high-accuracy GNSS positioning techniques that can used for establishing reference points for a host of surveying tasks, for machine control, for monitoring the stability of walls and benches in open-pit mines, and for use in other areas needing the combination of high positioning accuracy and high integrity.

 Although real-time high-accuracy systems based on GPS do currently exist, they suffer from limitations in areas of coverage, susceptibility to certain types of measurement errors, and poor performance in sub-optimum environments such as urban canyons, industrial areas, and in mines. The proposed research program will address these limitations by developing new techniques and procedures for using GPS measurements as well as in combining GPS measurements with those from GLONASS and the prototype Galileo constellations.

 A new signal for civil users is now available from the most recently launched GPS satellites. And starting with launches in 2009, a new class of GPS satellites will transmit a third additional civil signal. Although behind schedule, the Galileo program already has one test satellite in orbit with more to come within the next few years. The proposed research program will take advantage of these new signals.

 The Canadian Space Agency has identified satellite navigation and positioning as one of the key Canadian space-sector markets. The proposed research will lead to the development of a high-performance real-time positioning system which could have significant economic benefits to Canadian industry and for our export markets.

"The purpose of this on-going research program is to develop methodology and simulation-based tools for investigating the behaviour of dynamic systems operating in prescribed deterministic and pseudo-random motion environments.  Attention is specifically focused on two representative systems: the helicopter/ship dynamic interface and human postural stability.  Three short-term objectives are planned for the period covered by this grant application. (1) A computational model of a helicopter/ship system will be refined and integrated, along with a sea state weather model and pseudo-random ship motion generation approach, into a versatile Monte Carlo simulation such that risk-based probabilistic methodology can be used to discover elusive details relating to interface load spectra.  The load spectra will effectively quantify life cycle interface loading, probability of exceeding various design peak and fatigue load limits, and allow frequency-domain correlations between platform motions and interface forces. (2)  Rotor blade sailing, the phenomenon of large blade deflections occurring at low rotational speeds as the result of ship motion and unsteady aerodynamics, will continue to be investigated computationally and experimentally to discover how various conditions affect blade sailing and the extent to which the phenomenon can be attenuated using actively-controlled smart materials.  Both rigid-segment and continuous beam modelling approaches are used to provide accurate computationally-efficient solutions well suited for parametric studies. (3) Postural stability research will continue to develop articulated dynamic models of humans on moving bases to determine the relationship between model complexity and fidelity and use the results to establish an accurate motion-induced interruption model.  Inferences from these interrelated projects will be considered and generalized if possible in the context of the prescribed motion interface problem.

"Organisms have diverse ways and schedules to survive and reproduce, referred to as their ""life history strategies"".   This research addresses differences in life history strategies between species of small shorebirds, and also among individuals within species.  When characters have strong effects on an organism's survival or reproductive success, population biologists are challenged to explain why genetic variation for such characters persists.  This research explores mechanisms that permit coexistence of competing forms of such traits.  I work primarily with differences in reproductive behaviour and migration behaviour of sandpipers, small shorebirds.  Most of the research on reproductive behaviour involves a peculiar old-world sandpiper, the Ruff (Philomachus pugnax), in which three distinct types of males occur during the breeding season: (1) territorial males that fight for mating courts, (2) ""satellite"" males that do not fight, but are instead recruited to join with the normally territorial males on their courts, and (3) rare ""female mimic"" males, which neither flight nor display to females, but nonetheless do mate.  We are studying how these three kinds of males maintain themselves in populations, how they obtain matings with females, how behaviour is regulated hormonally, and what genetic differences exist among types.  Studies with related shorebird species ask why some females mate with several different males during a single breeding attempt.  We are testing theories about how females may gain from having more genetically diverse offspring.  In a final species, the Western Sandpiper, we are determining how migration distance affects future survivorship and reproductive rates.  It appears that birds that migrate farther have higher survivorship, but breed less often, than those with shorter migrations, which would represent a ""life history tradeoff"".  Understanding how different life histories persist helps us predict how adaptable species will be in the face of environmental changes.","Wildlife management",Environment,"Biological Sciences","Lank, David","RGPIN ",Behaviour,"Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",2-5

"The vast majority (>75%) of Earth's biosphere exists in permanently cold environments, including polar regions (14% of surface area) and deep ocean (90% by volume). However, the mechanisms by which organisms adapt to survive and thrive in these widespread environments are not well understood.  These systems are being disproportionately affected by global climate change and the impact of these changes on their microbial inhabitants is unclear. Understanding how these microorganisms adapt to these conditions is critical for predicting and comprehending the effects of climate change on Northern ecosystems and will provide insight into fundamental molecular and evolutionary adaptation mechanisms.  Furthermore, enzymes and microorganisms that are adapted to these conditions have been of great interest for industry and biotechnology.  My research program will focus on examining the diversity and dynamics of microorganisms and their mechanisms of adaptation to these extreme environments.  I will use advanced molecular biology and genomics based methods to obtain gene sequences from uncultured microorganisms from the Kaskawulsh Glacier in the Icefield Ranges of the St. Elias Mountains in southwest Yukon. One approach, stable isotope probing, will allow me, for the first time, to link the identity of the microorganisms to their environmental function. I will analyse gene sequences to determine microbial diversity, function, and evolutionary adaptations to the cold. These studies will provide insights into microbiology of extreme environments and adaptation to temperature extremes.

Les travaux propos�s sur le pin gris s'int�ressent aux m�canismes de d�veloppement de diverses fractions de fibres qui varie en fonction du type de fibres (bois d'�t� ou bois de printemps), mais aussi de leur longueur et morphologie respectives. Nous proposons un fractionnement suivi d'un traitement m�canique ou chimique des fractions individuelles. De cette fa�on, il sera possible d'optimiser le d�veloppement de certaines fractions en �vitant de sur-traiter les fibres qui ne peuvent se d�velopper. Un premier projet visera le traitement essentiellement m�canique des fractions, pour une utilisation dans le papier journal. En �vitant d'utiliser des produits chimiques, nous prot�geons les propri�t�s optiques (opacit� et coefficient de diffusion de la lumi�re). En appliquant sur chaque fraction diverses intensit�s de raffinage associ�es � une quantit� optimale d'�nergie, il sera possible de produire une p�te de meilleure qualit� avec un minimum d'�nergie sp�cifique. Le deuxi�me projet vise la fabrication d'une p�te chimico-thermom�canique puisque nous utiliserons divers produits chimiques pour faciliter le d�veloppement des diverses fractions obtenues par fractionnement. En appliquant ces produits uniquement sur les fractions n�cessitant un traitement, il en r�sultera une �conomie de produits et un meilleur contr�le du bouffant et de l'opacit� puisque certaines fractions pourraient demeurer non trait�es. Notre objectif est de remplacer une partie de la p�te kraft, plus dispendieuse, qui entre dans la fabrication des papiers � valeur ajout�e.

"In Canada, the number of total knee joint replacement (TKR) surgeries performed per year has increased dramatically over the last decade and will continue to increase as the population ages.  Although TKR surgery is generally effective in alleviating pre-surgical pain, a significant percentage of recipients don't recover full mobility and many continue to have difficulty with daily tasks.  This reduces quality of life while placing an ever increasing burden on the health care system and is the impetus for this work.



The driving research question behind this proposal is:  ""What are the biomechanical determinants of successful and unsuccessful functional outcomes of TKR procedures?"".  Many of the variables of interest in answering this question - such as muscle and joint contact forces - are difficult to measure directly in patients.  To overcome this, computational modelling approaches have been developed which use simulation techniques combined with subject data to estimate these values.



The goal of this proposal is to develop and enhance computational modelling tools that will allow investigation of the effects of factors such as implant design, surgical placement, patient physiology, and rehabilitation procedures on the functional outcomes for TKR patients.  The proposal will focus on advancing two modelling approaches; (i) a finite-element model developed by the applicant to look at design and surgical variables and (ii) adapting current leading edge gait analysis models to study lower-limb muscle forces in TKR recipients.

"This research program deals with the automatic analysis and generation of  texts building on our long experience in the area of Natural Language Processing. In particular, it emphasizes the need of taking into account semantics in the context of five projects, each corresponding to a three year Ph.D. thesis project. 



* Automatic Summarization: I want to explore the possibilities of a full syntactic parse to get at the underlying meaning of a text in order to summarize it. I intend to use the explicit relations between the components of a sentence in order to transform the syntactic tree and create abstractive summaries.

* Ontology building: I want to create ontologies directly from text through the use of a syntactic parser. I will start by extracting RDF triples which can be viewed as a simplified ontology and then go on to higher levels of abstraction.

* Semantic tagging of French: I intend to study how syntactic parsing and the detailed lexical information from the electronic dictionary of Dubois & Dubois-Charlier can be leveraged in a text mining or information extraction setting. 

* Document engineering: I will study the role documents play in different settings and the information contained in these documents from a management and strategic point of view.

* Principled real-time information display: in the light of the new possibilities offered by the dynamic Web pages that combine compelling user-interface techniques (e.g. SVG or Flash) with powerful server-side processing power, I will study how information can be conveyed appropriately in real-time.

"The automotive and paper industries are two of the largest in Canada.  In recent years they have sometimes contributed to more than half of Canada's balance of trade, and a lot of sub-activities (e.g. suppliers) depend on them.  Because of their spread, they are also industries in which global turbulence in international markets have a profound influence.  Factories at different sites over the globe, including Canada, are the ""products"" that managers work with, so their decisions (close or expand a plant) have large social impacts.  

What actually happens is that global markets and their sometimes inherent turbulent behaviours have changed the way profitability targets and shareholders' goals are met.  As a result, in addition to the traditional cost, quality, productivity, safety, environment and sustainability performance measures, new important metrics such as Flexibility, Agility and Evolution (FAE) now have to be considered.  The long term objective of this research program is to study these metrics, formalize them, and synthesize them into prediction simulation models enabling their assessment in an integrated manner.  

In light of new and acknowledged research evidence that FAE is indeed a key to profitability and survival, it is believed that the research in this proposal will help managers and engineers, at all levels of production, to stay focussed on what really needs to be done, such that Canadian plants, mills and processes maintain or even increase their profitability in the global market.

"Dairy farming has to be profitable and yet sensitive to environmental concerns. Both can be achieved through a lower input of dietary protein if feeds were better balanced to provide the correct mixture of amino acids (AA: the building blocks of proteins) needed to synthesize milk protein. Our project will examine two major issues of AA metabolism that could be incorporated in the predictive models of milk protein yield, such as NRC (2001). First current use of a fixed transfer of absorbed AA to milk protein leads to underestimation of milk protein yield at low supply and overestimation at high supply. Using a sophisticated experimental approach, we will identify key regulators of the losses of AA across the gut, liver and mammary gland. This will quantify the magnitude of the losses of AA in relation to supply and enable us to derive the variable efficiency of transfer of AA from absorption to milk. This will better represent the situation 'on farm' bringing as well a better understanding of intermediary metabolism. Second, we will assess how AA metabolism is affected by energy supply, i.e. could we decrease AA catabolism and then protein intake with a better supply of energy? In addition to complementing our knowledge on AA metabolism, these results can be rapidly transferred to the dairy industry and have an immediate impact on farm practice, with benefits to both the environment and farm economics.

"The Sun is the most abundant source of renewable energy, but the low efficiency and high cost of solar cells do not make them competitive with other energy technologies, particularly fossil fuels.  This proposal will develop a disruptive technology, namely semiconductor nanowires, which are expected to improve the efficiency and reduce fabrication costs of photovoltaic (PV) cells.  Our nanowires are one-dimensional rods, several microns long, 50 to 100 nm wide, and composed of Group III-V compounds such as GaAs.  Their unique geometry enhances light trapping and current extraction in PV cells, and they enable inexpensive and flexible substrates.  These benefits have not been realized in practical cells due to the complexities of nanowire fabrication.  This proposal will draw on our existing strengths in the fabrication of III-V nanowires to advance the state-of-the-art in photovoltaics.  The technology developed in this proposal will be commercialized in collaboration with Cleanfield Energy, an Ontario-based renewable/alternative energy company.

"This proposal seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in the field of nanowire (NW) research by developing novel device architectures with an emphasis on large-area (""macro-electronic"") applications, including: (1) Development of a cost-effective device platform based on NW ""nets"", with an emphasis on sensor applications;  (2) Development of core-multishell heterostructure NWs, with an emphasis on single photon sources; and (3) Development of a cost-effective device platform for flexible electronics based on the growth of NWs on carbon nanotube ""mats"", with an emphasis on photovoltaic applications.  Insight into the electron transport mechanisms in single NWs, bundled NWs, and NW networks will be provided by voltage-, frequency-, and temperature-dependent conductivity studies.  In addition, the optical properties of single NWs will be investigated by micro-photoluminescence for applications in photovoltaics, photodetectors, and light sources.  Finally, the influence of nanowire structure will be studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy.

"Fibre-reinforced composite materials have become an important class of materials used in diverse applications due to their high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. However, there is still some concern about utilizing composites in structural applications due to some uncertainty about their durability when they are exposed to high humidity levels.

One of the most common failure modes in composites is delamination, which is often initiated by low velocity impacts and propagates under cyclic mechanical loading until complete failure. Much research has been devoted to the degradation of composites in wet environments, but there is conflicting information in the literature on the effects of moisture on delamination resistance due to the complexity of the underlying phenomena. Published results indicate that the delamination resistance depends on moisture concentration, testing temperature, fiber orientation and the nature of the composite system. These parameters will be controlled in the proposed work.

The proposed research program will experimentally investigate the effects of moisture on the delamination growth in unidirectional and cross-ply AS4/3501-6 graphite-epoxy composites. Test coupons will be exposed to controlled high humidity levels and tested for delamination resistance and delamination growth rate. This research will determine the effects of humidity on the durability of the studied composite system, a widely used material in the aircraft industry. These results will provide valuable data for composite structure designers. Also, in parallel to the testing, the research program will aim at modelling the delamination growth process after exposure to humidity. This constitutes a first step in developing models to estimate the life of composite structures subjected to cyclic loading in humid conditions.

"With the growth of genome-wide data in phylogenomics, new methods are becoming available to combine gene trees defined on overlapping sets of taxa (supertrees), analyze multi-gene alignments with incomplete data (supermatrices) or resolve conflicts among different genes by allowing reticulations in phylogenetic trees (supernetworks). I want to investigate the methodological and theoretical aspects of such approaches, and then apply these methods to address important questions in evolutionary biology.



METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS: In this proposal, (1) the accuracy of supertrees with branch lengths will be assessed with simulations, (2) a conditional-combination test will be developed to determine whether different genes should be combined in a supermatrix prior to phylogenetic analysis, and (3) various statistical procedures will be proposed to measure the reliability of supertrees. We also want to make further comparisons to (4) assess the effect of missing data in supermatrices, with ways to circumvent with this problem, and (5) investigate the use of consensus networks and supernetworks to combine independent phylogenies and represent incongruence among a collection of gene trees.



APPLICATIONS: In this proposal, (1) we will use the methods developed to combine trees defined on overlapping sets of taxa to test specific hypotheses in comparative phylogeography, (2) determine the conditions under which this approach may be used in population genetics, and (3) assess the stability of various mammalian supertrees with respect to the corresponding total-evidence trees.

"The ability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to survive and dominate in such diverse anaerobic ecosystems as the intestinal tract and our food can be attributed to competitive advantages such as their fermentative metabolism, which creates acidic conditions not tolerated by all microorganisms. They also compete by excreting other extracellular products such as antimicrobial compounds and exopolysaccharides (EPS). These polymers, which are very diverse in structure, have been attributed a role in protecting the bacterial cell against physical, chemical and biological stresses of the environment. They are important in forming biofilms on substrates and host tissues, in countering predation and avoiding host defence mechanisms, as well as in overcoming pH and nutrient limitations. Surface oligosaccharides of probiotic bacteria may contribute to inhibiting pathogen binding in the gastrointestinal tract, thus preventing infection. The biosynthesis of EPS involves diverting sugar precursors away from glycolysis and sequestering them in an extracellular polymer. The necessity of maintaining a balance between energy production, cell constituents and other endproducts implies a complex regulatory mechanism for exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, thus providing an ideal model system for studying gene regulation and environmental sensing mechanisms. Ultimately, this knowledge can be applied to optimising or selecting novel activities useful to the food industry and to human health. Polysaccharide structure and size modulate their functional activities. Even though advances have been accomplished on the physiology of EPS production, little is known on the regulatory mechanisms for lactic acid and probiotic bacteria. Now that more is known about EPS gene clusters of lactobacilli, lactococci and bifidobacteria through the work of our group, future research will concentrate on the role of growth phase and oxygen in controlling gene expression as well as the polymerisation process itself. Understanding gene regulation and protein function in lactic acid bacteria is essential for improving yogurt and cheese starter microorganisms, as well as for preventing food spoilage and improving human health.

"In 2007, dairy products sales were evaluated at $11.6 billion, accounting for 15% of the Canadian food and beverage sector. Cheddar production continues to increase, hitting 67,127,000 kg in 2008 for Quebec alone, which is 46.5% of Canada's production of Cheddar cheese. Cheeses represent 24.6% of Canadian dairy product exports, but these exports make up only 1% of dairy products on the international market. The large quantity of lactic starter cultures required for making this amount of cheese represents an important investment and any problems with quality control can lead to considerable losses due to fermentation or ripening failures. For Cheddar cheese, starters are composed of mixed strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and there is a strong relationship between cheese quality and flavour and the technological aptitudes of the lactococcal strains used. However, not all strains are compatible in mixed culture and may produce undesired effects such as bitter or off-flavours in the cheese that are only detected after the costly ripening period, resulting in cheese downgrading and loss of consumer confidence. Many strains become sensitive to phage attack, and must be replaced. Thus, considerable effort in time and money is put into characterization and evaluation of the performance of lactococcal strains by conventional methods in terms of their metabolic activities. A rational choice of industrial strains must be founded on objective criteria of technological aptitude and performance, which could be facilitated using innovative predictive modelling issuing from a deeper understanding of strain stability and compatibility that will be revealed through gene and protein expression. The aim of this project is to predict milk fermentation performance by classifying gene and protein expression profiles as indicators of

metabolic activity in order to evaluate and select the best starter culture mixes for Cheddar cheese obtaining the highest classification. The molecular methods developed will be available to dairy scientists and could be offered as services to the dairy industry in order to facilitate the management of starter strain rotation and thus to ensure the highest quality Cheddar cheese.

"This project involves 8 university researchers with a range of biological and hydrological expertises. It aims to study the physical controls and biological significance for salmonids of localized, cool water refugia sites along rivers in southern Quebec and New Brunswick. Under a 21st century regime of warming summers, such thermal refugia may become key, limiting habitats for the survival of our dominant cold water sport fish, salmon and brook trout, at the southern limits of their population range. Cool thermal refugia are both heterogeneous and visually inconspicuous: they range widely in dimensions, spatial distribution and physical controls: some are associated with groundwater upwellings along river beds, others with the mouths of particular tributaries and some, with small hyporheic seeps. The typical separation between these cryptic habitats along salmon or trout rivers systems is poorly known as is the ability of salmonids to detect and migrate significant distances to such sites, or fish mortality rates as a function of distances and temperature patterns. Moreover, under likely scenarios of future temperature, rainfall and snow cover conditions for the later 21st century, the relative dimensions and value as thermal refugia of major types of in-stream groundwater upwellings is also unclear. This project will apply thermal IR detection combined with fish ecology field surveys to study the spatial distribution and support capacity of these habitats. Generic hydrogeological models will explore a range of in-stream groundwater upwelling settings in context of regional climate scenarios. Our industrial partner Hydro-Quebec needs our state of the art tools and models to monitor and predict effects of river flow modifications (and deep reservoir releases) on fish habitats (including thermal refugia) on the river ecosystems they impact. Broad environmental benefits for Canada can be expected in terms of adaptations to climate change of Boreal river ecosystem management and optimisation of future fish conservation investments, by clarifying to what extent future thermal regimes can limit the productivity or the survival of cold water species in individual rivers, as a function of its particular refugia spatial distribution.","Wildlife management",Environment,Geography,"Lapointe, Michel","CRDPJ ","Aquatic ecology and limnology","Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",1-3
"Salmon fisheries play a role in the regional economies along both coasts of Canada while trout angling is an important recreational industry in the Canadian interior. Substantial funds are currently spent on the rehabilitation and management of freshwater salmonid (salmon, trout) habitat, under threat from damming, improper forestry and farm practices, highway construction, etc.  To minimize habitat degradation or to be more effective in rehabilitation, it is important to understand where the most productive or most sensitive habitats  are located along a river. This research proposes to apply novel models of river landscape structure (sedimentary link models) to better answer these questions. 



Salmon production in freshwaters can critically depend on a complex juxtaposition of different stream habitat types within a  watershed: lakes, pool-riffle cobble reaches, boulder rapid reaches etc.; insuring, within distances that individual fish can  swim as they grow, clean, gravel-cobble reaches for reproduction and fry rearing, boulder-rich sections for rearing of older salmon parr, and finally thermal refugia and backchannel zones that allow survival through periods of heat stress in summer and ice-related stress in winter. The proposed research program uses novel geomatics, air photo and field techniques to understand the geomorphic controls on salmonid habitat acting across these spatial scales and applying this knowledge to habitat management and conservation. A major research focus is to test hypotheses concerning the effects on salmon abundances of details of riverscape structure (length  and organisation of 'sedimentary links' along valleys, spacing and distribution of bedrock canyons, of boulder rich zones, of   cool water tributaries, etc).

"During an event of a radiological/nuclear (R/N) nature, many of the steps in the various phases (early, intermediate, and late) will be strongly impacted by the quantities and qualities of the analytical results provided to first responders. For this reason, many organisations have invested in the development of automated radiodetection systems designed for specific event detection which enable higher analytical throughput, more reliability in the analytical process and reduce the reliance on highly qualified personnel which might be reluctant to work during any type of events. However, the development of automated tools

suited for the detection of radionuclides and sources can only flourish through the synthesis and commercialization of selective functionalized materials suited for the harsh environment in which they might be subjected. Features such as high-selectivity, chemical/radiological stability, and reusability are highly regarded in the nuclear industry.

This proposal is aimed at developing two new types of functionalized materials for the concentration/purification of prime candidates (i.e. radiocesium, actinides) during an R/N event. Siliceous materials will be functionalized using various synthesis strategies and characterized to determine the sucess of the approaches chosen. Materials based on immobilized ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP) and multi-functionalization of mesoporous inorganic and inorganic-organic composite supports will be developed and subsequently tested using an automated flow injection system (AFIS) to ensure their compliance with

predefined parameters relevant in emergency situation response and with conditions pertaining to CANDU technologies. In addition to fulfilling a critical gap in event detection, the new materials will also have strong beneficial outcomes for the Canadian nuclear industry which also has to perform radiochemical analyses for regulatory purposes.","Nuclear energy","Energy resources",Chimie,"Larivi�re, Dominic","STPGP ","Materials structure, properties and testing","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",1-3
"The renewed interest in nuclear energy as an environmentally-friendly alternative to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel while sustaining the growing global need in electricity brings new challenges to radioecologists, scientists that study the behaviour of radionuclides in the environment and their impact on the biota, including humans. The expected growth in nuclear activities worldwide must be accompanied by technological innovations that will enable a better evaluation and monitoring to ensure the proper use of these installations and the safety of the surrounding populations and environments. 



     In order to perform such task in a prompter and more cost-effective manner, new radioanalytical methodologies (e.g. preparation of sample, measurements, automation) are required. This proposal will investigate and develop new chemical and instrumental approaches to facilitate the detection and quantification of actinides, by-products found in spent nuclear fuel (SNF), in industrial and environmental matrices. Such analytical innovations will provide the nuclear industry with faster, accurate and cost-effective tools to assess and minimize the impact of its activity. This proposal use these novel analytical tools to study the environmental behaviour of naturally-occurring actinides (i.e. Uranium) and the change in its isotopic composition to better understand its impact on population. This information will generate new knowledge necessary to better model the biological and environmental behaviour of this omnipresent radioelement. Both technical and scientific knowledge generated throughout the lifespan of this proposal will impact directly on our ability to detect and quantify possible emission of radionuclides in the environment at ultra-low levels and provide data concerning the protection of the flora and fauna with respect to ionizing radiation.

"The research program of this proposal is divided into two parts: 1) Nonparametric methods for clustered/multilevel data and for one-sided alternatives, 2) Tree and ensemble based methods for survival, clustered and multivariate data.



Situations involving clustered and multilevel data are often encountered in practice and some typical examples of clusters are schools, families, strata (in survey samples) and, repeated measurements on a subject. It is well-known that ignoring the intra-cluster correlation leads to erroneous inference (usually the tests and confidence intervals are too liberal).  The main long term objective of the first part of the research program is to develop extensions of nonparametric methods, mostly rank and sign based methods, for multivariate multilevel data and for one-sided and ordered alternatives. 



The objective of the second part of the research program is to develop tree based methods for new problems. Tree based methods have been successfully applied to many problems and are tools that can be easily understood by non-statisticians. The recent development of ensemble methods, like Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests, has renewed the interest towards these methods. Tree based methods have mainly been developed to handle a univariate categorical outcome, a continuous outcome or a censored continuous outcome (survival trees). However, the literature is sparse for other situations. In the next few years, the goal will be to develop methods for an interval-censored outcome (measured on a continuous or a discrete scale), for a clustered right-censored outcome and for clustered univariate and multivariate outcomes (continuous, categorical and a mix of both).

"To better quantify the changes of temperature through time, a model will be created to quantify temperature using the larvae of insects (chironomids) preserved in lake sediments. These larvae will be sampled in 190 lakes from southern Quebec to Ellesmere Island. Each taxa will be attributed a temperature optimum and these optima will be used to create a quantitative model for temperature reconstruction. Sediment cores will be extracted from many lakes in a north-south transect to reconstruct the temperature during the last 10 000 years using the communities of chironomids preserved in the sediments. The data will indicate the natural variation of climate through time, as well as the changes observed since anthropogenic activities have started.

"Tree-ring analysis (dendrochronology) can address many scientific questions regarding past environmental conditions, and at an annual resolution. Most regions of Canada have been investigated to some degree using dendrochronological methods, but by far the least studied is the Atlantic Coast.

    )	The primary goal of this research is to continue to fill the gap that currently exists in the Canadian dendrochronological databank. Owing to the limited old-growth forest that remains in the region, samples will be collected both from centuries-old historical structures and from the few remnant populations of old trees that remain in the region. This approach has proven to be the only means of extending tree-ring records to produce the type of long-term, annually resolved paleoenvironmental models that long-lived trees have allowed us to develop elsewhere in Canada.

    )	Data from this project will be used to explore past temperature and precipitation patterns in Atlantic Canada, including the North Atlantic Oscillation, and to develop and map paleoclimatic reconstructions. 

    )	Specific objectives are to (1) continue to locate and sample any remaining remnant populations of old-growth forest in the region to establish their annual growth records; (2) use historical wooden structures to extend the growth records of individual species in the region; (3) use the extended tree-ring chronologies from multiple species along with historical climate records to develop robust paleoclimatic approximations for both terrestrial and oceanic phenomena; and (4) map the paleoclimatic history of Atlantic Canada at micro and macro scales.

    )	As human atmospheric impacts become better understood, the need for reliable regional and global climate models has never been as great. Creating robust approximations of past climatic conditions is fundamental in calibrating and verifying these models, which help us to understand past climates and to forecast future climate fluctuations in Canada and around the world.

"Objectives:    The objective of the proposed research is to improve the understanding of the flow mechanisms behind the generation of aerodynamic drag for bluff bodies with complex three dimensional shapes and in particular for cases where Reynolds number effects can be dominant.  The research will focus on Olympic sports and surface vehicles applications.  By improving the understanding of the load generation mechanism it is believed that drag reduction can be achieved as well as improvement of the aerodynamic performance and the overall energy efficiency.  

Summary of scientific approach:  Automobiles, alpine skiers, speed skaters, bobsleighs are bluff bodies with somewhat similar aerodynamics where regions of separated flow govern the generation of drag.  Also, when such bodies reach a certain threshold speed, aerodynamic drag forms the main resisting force to motion.  Wind tunnels are generally used to study their aerodynamics where the relative speed between the air and the body is often well simulated but the relative speed between the body and the ground is not well simulated.  The proposed research will continue to use wind tunnels as the main tool for the investigations of the fluid forces on such bluff bodies.  However, it is proposed to simulate as closely as possible in the wind tunnel the conditions that could have an impact on the aerodynamics in-situ, i.e. in the field of play for an athlete or on the road for a surface vehicle.   The wind tunnel facilities of the Aerodynamics Laboratory of NRC's Institute for Aerospace Research will be used for the research including the new ground motion simulation systems.   Drag reduction strategies will be investigated in an effort to improve energy efficiency and aerodynamic performance.  Through modelling and simulation of a typical event, the drag reduction will be converted in direct time saving for an athlete or in fuel economy for a production car.

"The human body is composed of various tissues, which in turn consist of cells that have specialized functions. The coordinated regulation of the human cell functions involves biochemical processes mediating the modification of the activity of cellular proteins. One such important modification that affects protein activity implicates the phosphorylation of these specific proteins by specialized enzymes that are defined as protein kinases. Our laboratory is interested in the basic study of protein phosphorylation and in the identification of the protein kinases participating in this process. As a working model, we focus on the small protein Nck that we have found heavily phosphorylated in various stress conditions known to activate a specific subset of protein kinases. Our research will benefit the whole scientific community by providing a detailed understanding of fundamental mechanisms regulating the human cell functions.

"The main goal of this project is to understand the role of alloy composition in the formation of defects in welds, taking into account the fraction liquid evolution and the morphology of the microstructure during solidification. The research will focus on the development of an algorithm predicting the temperature where new phases start to crystallize and calculating their specific growth rates. Since cooling rates are very fast in welding, the algorithm will have to take into account phenomena associated to liquid-solid interface moving at high velocities. Experimentations will be conducted in controlled conditions by using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), which measures the heat released during solidification. The cooling curves obtained with this instrument will be analysed using an original mathematical treatment so that it will be possible to compare theoretical and experimental heat rate extraction. This work will be used to investigate hot cracking in welds, which is caused by residual stresses exceeding the strength of the not completely solidified butt weld. Experimentations of hot cracking in welding will be conducted to know the critical stress and critical temperature where the alloy is prone to crack. The role of iron in the fusion zone will be particularly investigated in two alloys of the 6XXX series. It seems that intermetallic phases containing iron could play an important role in the initiation of hot cracking.","Materials sciences","Advancement of knowledge","G�nie des mines, m�tallurgie et mat�riaux","Larouche, Daniel","RGPIN ","Materials science and technology","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",2-5

"The coalescent process, a stochastic process used to simulate population genealogies, has attracted much  attention recently, mostly due to the numerous applications in human genetics research. We have developed a  method, which uses the coalescent process with recombination (Larribe et al. 2002, Larribe 2004) to estimate  the location of a genetic mutation influencing a disease, e.g. to do genetic fine mapping. After having  improved the stability of the estimates using ""windows"" of genetic marker and composite-conditional-likelihood strategy (Larribe and Lessard 2008), we propose to develop further the method in the context of complex genetic disease, which is of major interest in human genetics today. The goal is to be able to estimate parameters of a genetic model (incomplete penetrance and phenocopy), to take these estimated  parameters into account in the method, to be able to model complex schemes of interactions between genes, to be able to treat quantitative trait and to develop the method at the genome scale.



Moreover, we would like to be able to take into account non-random selection of cases and controls (over representation of cases in the sample) by model the frequency of the disease mutation backward in time. Finally, we will propose a new way to estimate to make inference in the context of the coalescent.

"We are currently witnessing the growth of a new paradigm of open computing systems, as embodied by the Internet.  The heterogeneous participants in these systems (which we call agents) often have diverging information and interests.  In particular, in many situations these agents are self-interested and will act to further their own goals, irrespective of the desires of others, nor is it reasonable to assume that a system designer is able to force these agents to behave in some socially optimal way. Interesting applications with these properties range from new electronic marketplaces and auctions, to differentiated scheduling for Internet service provisioning.



The fields of game theory and mechanism design have significantly influenced  formal models for self-interested multi-agent systems, by providing a set of tools for addressing coordination problems. However, computational issues have meant that in many interesting settings classic game-theoretic  approaches are not robust. For example, classic assumptions made in game theory and mechanism design are that the agents are fully rational, they know which outcomes they prefer, they can easily communicate their preferences and they have infinite computing power.  Additionally, in many mechanism-design settings, it is assumed that the mechanism is able to efficiently process large amounts of information and optimally solve complex optimization problems in order to determine the desired outcome.  When these assumptions fail to hold, a potentially hazardous gap arises between what the classic approaches predict and what happens in reality. Resolving the conflicts between the game-theoretic and computational constraints, as well as developing appropriate models of the participating agents, are key research challenges which I intend to pursue. A driving application for this research program is the design of electronic marketplaces, however, this research will also provide a foundation for studying and using game-theoretic and approaches in other computer systems.

"The proposed research program seeks to examine macroevolutionary changes of palaeoecological and anatomical evolution. While macroevolution is broadly considered as evolution above the species level, the proposed research program will focus on multiples scales within ecological and anatomical evolution to work toward bridging the units of change underlying each scale. Research at the palaeoecological level will examine how external factors, such as area, climate and latitude, correlate with changing terrestrial community composition, provinciality, and fragmentation throughout different temporal scales throughout the Mesozoic Era (250 - 65 million years ago) and spatial scales within Canada and throughout the Americas. Research of anatomical evolution will estimate the tempo and mode of morphological transitions of the radical skeletal transformations of the appendiculum (arm and leg) across the fish fin to tetrapod limb and dinosaur arm to bird wing transitions and what developmental mechanisms may have been responsible for those morphological changes. By combining research at the community and lineage level, these approaches to macroevolutionary change strive to discover what forces shape macroevolutionary events, derive new methods to integrate macroevolutionary changes at their many temporal and spatial scales, and provide an interdisciplinary environment for graduate student training.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Redpath Museum","Larsson, Hans","RGPIN ","Evolution and ecology","Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",2-2

"Two quite different perspectives can be taken on the problem of species evolution. The historical perspective consists in reconstructing the evolutionary history of all living species (the tree of life), based on fossil evidence and molecular sequence comparisons. This is the task of phylogenetics. Recently, it has motivated important statistical efforts so as to provide reliable tree reconstructions. The demographic and mechanistic perspective, on the other hand, is more concerned with understanding how the intricate interplay between mutation, selection and random drift determines the mode of evolution of extant species, down to the molecular level. It also tries to understand how the ecological factors experienced by a species (such as its population size) influence this interplay. Population genetics provides the theoretical framework for such an understanding. Classical population genetics achieves its aims mainly by observing the distribution of intra-specific genetic diversity (polymorphisms). However, it is progressively understood that very valuable information can also be derived from the large-scale comparative analyses performed by phylogeneticists. This information is less detailed than that derived from polymorphisms. However, it reaches much further back in time, raising the exciting possibility that by reading it out, one could reconstruct the evolution of essential ecological factors experienced by species along the tree of life.



Our long-term research program will contribute to a theoretical synthesis of the historical and mechanistic perspectives proposed by phylogenetics and population genetics. Our short-term research will more specifically consist in performing large-scale phylogenetic reconstructions of the ecological factors driving global evolutionary trends. We expect that this merging of the two perspectives will greatly advance our understanding of the link between the geological context (e.g. continental drift, global temperature, etc.) ecological behaviours (parasitism, sexuality), and the evolution of biological diversity.

"The purpose of the proposed research is to study electrocatalytic reactions of hydrogen adsorption, absorption and evolution, mechanism and kinetics of metal hydride formation, and modeling of porous electrodes. This study will lead to a better understanding of these reactions and to develop better electrode materials for hydrogen storage and water electrolysis. This research includes:

1. Mechanism and kinetics of hydrogen absorption: Our earlier studies suggest that the direct absorption mechanism is the main reaction path and that going through adsorbed hydrogen is much slower. This process will be further studied on other Pt alloys as Pd-Rh, Pd-Ru, etc., which are very important from the electrocatalytic point of view. Adsorption of H and the influence of different poisons on the H absorption processes will be studied. Adsorption isotherms and the kinetics of hydrogen adsorption and absorption will be determined. It should be stressed that several poisons of hydrogen adsorption act as promoters of hydrogen absorption increasing the kinetics of this process. These processes, studied initially in the presence of sulfuric acid will be extended to the non adsorbed perchloric acid and to alkaline solutions.

2. Kinetics and thermodynamics of adsorption processes: Hydrogen adsorption reaction is the simplest electrocatalytic reaction. Its kinetics already studied in our laboratory on polycrystalline Pt will be further studied on other noble metals (polycrystalline Rh, Ru, Ir), alloys (Pd-Rh, Pd-Ru, Pd-Ir) and monocrystalline metals using the twin electrode technique developed recently in our lab.

3. Modeling of porous electrodes: The kinetics of simple redox reactions will be studied on porous electrodes characterized by the well defined porous geometry (e.g. brush electrodes) to test the theory.

"The past decade has witnessed explosive growth in interest and research on lake sediments. The bottom deposits of lakes can provide a very detailed record of changes that occurred both within the lake itself and in the surrounding catchment. Because lakes occupying topographically closed basins are more sensitive than other depositional systems to climate-induced fluctuations, it is no surprise that the sediments of these closed basins are attractive targets for paleoenvironmental research. However, before we can 'read' this important archive of past environmental change, we must first understand the processes by which the sediments are brought into the basin, deposited and changed. In short, we must understand the modern lakes before we can interpret the preserved ancient records. Much of my research over the past decade has concentrated on understanding the complex interactions and sedimentary processes occurring in modern closed basin salt lakes. Although significant advances have been made, there is still much to do. I propose to conduct research on the sedimentology and paleolimnology of closed basin salt lakes in 3 areas of the world: (i) Northern Great Plains of western Canada, (ii) western Volcanic Plains District and Eyre Peninsula of southern Australia, and (iii) Galapagos Islands in the eastern Pacific region. These three areas were chosen because of specific environmental concerns as well as the complementary nature of the lacustrine systems in each region. My long-term scientific objectives of this research are to (i) quantitatively describe the modern sedimentary processes operating in selected basins, (ii) understand the origin and post-depositional changes that have occurred in the deposits in these lakes; (iii) decipher the environmental conditions of carbonate mineral formation in selected basins, with particular emphasis on the enigmatic minerals dolomite and monohydrocalcite in the Canadian and Australian lakes, and finally (iv) interpret the environmental changes that have occurred in the lakes during the past 10k yrs, and relate these changes to any natural evolutionary trends, regional climatic fluctuations and anthropogenic modifications.

"Large earthquake is recognized as the greatest natural hazard in major urban centres across Canada. A research program is proposed to develop advanced seismic assessment methodology and tools for more accurate evaluation of the seismic performance of complex bridges, and innovative techniques and cost-effective solutions for mitigation of the seismic risk of reinforced concrete shear wall structural systems.  The goal of the research program is to enhance the safety and security of Canada's critical infrastructures, contribute toward the development and advances of performance-based earthquake engineering and design of safer and more loss-resistant infrastructures.  The research program consists of three parts: (i) Seismic modeling and analysis of bridges; (ii) Network hybrid testing of large structures; and (iii) Seismic repair and strengthening of reinforced concrete shear walls using a novel FRP-tube anchor system.

      The concept of hybrid testing and simulation is developed to overcome the difficulty of high cost and physical limitation in testing more realistic full size structures. In a multi-site hybrid test, the test structure is divided into substructures tested or simulated at a different laboratory. Internet-based virtual laboratory testing facilitates more efficient utilization of test facilities at different laboratories by giving researchers around the world the flexibility and means to conduct large scale experiments through sharing of equipment and computing resources.

      The research will help to tackle the very complex and costly problem of renewal of deteriorated bridge infrastructure in Canada.  It will help to identify the truly dangerous structures from the adequate ones, those fail but not collapse. For example, a partially damaged bridge may still have the capacity to function as an emergency route bridge or for evacuation purpose without the need of costly retrofit. The assessment tools would be very useful for prioritizing and allocation of limited resources for reducing the seismic risk of existing bridges.

"This proposal aims at further lifting the scientific understanding and technological impact of our research in novel chemistry induced by hyperthermal collision. Since 2004, we have shown with many examples that when adsorbed organic precursor molecules are bombarded by 5-10eV protons, generally only their C-H bonds are cleaved because the kinetic energy transfer is merely effective in H---H collisions. The recombination of the carbon radicals leads to cross-linking the molecules into a stable molecular network having the desirable chemical functionalities of the precursor. A ""green"" technology requiring little chemical reagents other than hydrogen is thus invented to produce a cross-linked molecular film with tailor-made properties for surface modification or membrane applications. In 2008, we successfully developed a production prototype reactor to show that neutral hyperthermal molecular hydrogen can be generated to replace protons, for surface modification of electrically insulating substrates such as polymers or biomaterials. Grafting molecules with desirable chemical/biochemical properties on a polymer in a large area (>300 cm2) with a high throughput (< 1 second of exposure time) has indeed been demonstrated. Technology commercialization is under way.

To learn more about the basic science in this powerful technology of using kinematics to break C-H bonds, we will use CH3-Si(111) as our model sample to study the nature of the collision-induced reactions as a function of the energy and collision angle of hyperthermal hydrogen projectiles.  We will use our scanning tunneling microscopes and high resolution electron energy loss spectrometer to study the surface chemical changes induced by the bombardment. To expand the scope of this novel kinematics-driven chemistry, we will use our high flux of hyperthermal hydrogen and inert gas to prepare practical quantities of fullerenes encapsulating these species, and compare the experimental results with our computation data. This new means of producing practical amounts of fullerene derivatives will significantly advance fullerene chemistry. One PDF and two graduate students will be trained per year.

"Lie algebras are mathematical objects that describe the symmetries of certain physical systems.  Since many such systems have infinitely many independent symmetries, it is natural to study infinite-dimensional Lie algebras.  For example, one of the most important families of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, called the affine Lie algebras, come from symmetries occurring in string theory.



Even more important than the Lie algebras themselves are the ways in which they act as symmetries of spaces, called representations.  A Lie algebra typically has a great many representations, and understanding them can give more information about the Lie algebra, or even about the physics of the system from which the Lie algebra arises.



The goal of this research program is to investigate the structure and representations of generalizations of the affine Lie algebras, with special emphasis on multivariable analogues of these Lie algebras.  In particular, we expect to give the first description and classification of several such representations, and we will use internal symmetries (called automorphisms) to draw conclusions about the structure of these objects.

"Our research has initially focused on fundamental problems in geometric modeling of man-made objects from range (3D) data for off-line model building. We then addressed the problem of interactive modeling. The concept of vector field was proposed and has led to both scientific and commercial achievements. Over these years, the power of off-the-shelf computers has increased drastically and fields such as computer graphics, virtual reality, distributed computing, and simulation have made significant progress. We are now witnessing a convergence of these fields with the field of computer vision. Today, workteams rarely design complex systems or plan operations in complex environments without simulating them. Adding dynamic behaviour to the geometric models, making these models interact in realistic simulations, and providing users with flexible tools for exploring the simulations are challenging topics that motivate the program presented in this proposal whose long term objective is to develop an integrated framework for supporting physics-based simulation in complex 3D geometric environments.The program is comprised of two components: i) a vision component which aims at building geometric models of very large structures (buildings, towns, etc.), and ii) a virtual reality component which aims at developing an approach for adding behaviours to these geometric models and for exploring these behaviours in immersive virtual reality environments. This program expands our current line of research, addresses the convergence between fields, and opens promising tracks of investigation. To reach this long term objective, the research will first focus on four short term objectives: 1- in the vision component, expand the vector field framework to the problem of geometric modeling of very large environments; 2- in the virtual reality component, develop the foundations of a framework for interactive visual exploration of simulations in immersive environments; 3-train highly qualified personnel; 4- publish the research results and transfer the technology to the user sector.

"The future generations of aircraft will be designed with an increased emphasis on energy efficiency, which calls

for reductions in weight and air drag. In this context, the transition from an aluminum to a lighter-weight

carbon fiber-based composite fuselage undertaken by major industry players such as Airbus and Boeing is

probably the most significant in terms of impact on aircraft engineering. From an electromagnetic point of

view, the paradigm of highly effective shielding and grounding provided by the aircraft skin becomes highly

questionable. Consequently additional cables and shields might be needed, which may jeopardize the desired

weight reduction.

The objective ofthis proposal is to address these questions by first studying electromagnetic material properties

and propagation ofradiofrequency waves in complex composite structures found on aircrafts. Analytical

solutions and electromagnetic simulation tools capable ofmodelling such structures will be developed and

validated. Based on these studies, novel aircraft antennas adapted for operation on a composite ""ground""

environment will be designed. To reduce air drag and vibrations, this project will aim at combining several

antennas into single multi-band units. Another approach consists in making them conformal with the fuselage.

In this case, the potential ofusing recently developed artificial magnetic conductors as a substrate in low

profile dipole-like structures will be investigated. Finally, in order to minimize weight associated with the

bulky equipment and numerous radiofrequency cables connected to these antennas, new integrated

architectures of compact radio transmitters and receivers will be studied, in view of in-situ implementation, i.e.

as close as possible to the antennas mounted on the fuselage. The use ofa multilayer integrated circuit

technology such as the low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) will be favoured for such an application. This

research will be in support of developments toward a new composite aircraft undertaken by Bombardier

"Long range present day weather radars, whose color images are often seen on television, provide forecasters with information concerning incoming or developing storms. Accurate forecasting is essential to increase our preparedness and reduce the costs of such severe weather. Existing systems do not make good measurements close to the surface because weak weather echoes are hard to pick up when they compete with strong echoes from ground and the earth curvature bring the radar beam well above ground at ranges beyond 60 km. Obtaining better information calls for denser radar networks as well as a new radar technology, known as electronic beam steerable antenna systems. These systems are currently too expensive to be used for weather applications.

In this project, we want to explore the possibilities to design relatively low-cost radars based on such antennas, by using clever simplifications to their design. The partnership between engineering and meteorological expertise allows for a design in which technological characteristics are tailored to users.

They key component of the radar is an antenna capable of scanning rapidly and accurately a very narrow beam over a sector of 360� in azimuth and 30� in elevation. The objective is to achieve this with a purely electronic steering mechanism, but hybrid electronic/mechanical solutions will also be examined. A variety of concepts including combinations of reflectors, direct radiating arrays, reflectarrays and transmit arrays will be studied. Antenna's phase controlled radiating elements based on MEMS and diodes will be designed in order to allow experimental investigation of the most critical design aspects and predict performance. In parallel, control algorithms and their digital hardware implementations will be developed in order to perform beam calibration and real-time steering.

The project is supported by industry partners active in radars and in high-gain antenna design.","Climate and atmosphere",Environment,"G�nie �lectrique","Laurin, JeanJacques","STPGP ","Microwave and millimeterwave devices, circuits and technologies","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",1-3
"The program covers two areas in microwave engineering. The first area addresses novel reconfigurable spacecraft antennas. Once a telecommunication satellite is in orbit, a reconfigurable antenna would allow the coverage region to be modified as a function of market demand, thus providing re-use capability of a payload in different missions over a the satellite's lifetime. Reconfigurability is also needed in remote sensing antennas used for earth imaging. In this case, the main antenna beam can be modified at a very high rate. For small satellites, an attractive antenna technology consists in using flexible membranes to make reflectors and directly radiating arrays. Membranes are lightweight and can be folded to reduce stowage volume during launch, which considerably reduces mission costs. Feasibility of reconfigurable membrane antennas will depend on new devices with tunable response and availability of low-loss transmission lines. The program will propose new tunable devices designed specifically for implementation on membranes. Reconfigurable lens and reflector structures will also be studied.

The second area of the program is covering microwave tomography (MT) techniques applied to the detection of breast cancer. This type of cancer is the most common among Canadian women. Due to the high permittivity contrast of tumors, MT appears as a potential complement to X-ray mammography. The aim of the project is to develop a low-cost and radiation-free test system comprising transmit antennas, a probe array and a breast confinement structure that are optimized to favour tumor detection. To improve resolution, the system will use near-field inverse scattering techniques with measurements taken at only a small fraction of the wavelength from the structure under test. The program will also include the development of new techniques to improve the computing efficiency of the inverse problem algorithms used to recover breast permittivity distributions from scattered near-field data. These algorithms will have to be fast and work with discretized three-dimension models having a spatial resolution better than five millimeters.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","Information and communication services","G�nie �lectrique","Laurin, JeanJacques","RGPIN ","Antennas and propagation","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",2-5

Par ailleurs, l'eutrophisation continue des milieux aquatiques cause une prolif�ration des cyanobact�ries nocives, pouvant �tre exacerb�e par les CC.

"The goal of my research program is to better understand major elemental cycles in aquatic systems.  Nitrogen loading to aquatic systems is the most pervasive form of chemical pollution in these ecosystems.  Some fraction of this nitrogen can be removed by denitrification (reduction of nitrate to N2), thus denitrification has the potential to improve water quality. However, a byproduct of denitrification, N2O, is a potent greenhouse gas.  Aquatic systems are already a significant source of nitrous oxide and this source is projected to increase as global use of nitrogen fertilizers, and therefore nitrogen pollution of aquatic systems, increases.  



The end-products of denitrification are gases, making it challenging to measure rates of production in the field. As a result, most research on denitrification and N2O production is bench-top scale, lacking the ecological complexity of natural systems.  At this scale, it is not possible to determine the importance of higher-level physical, biological, or chemical factors that affect denitrification. We, therefore, know little about how important lakes are as sinks for nitrogen and sources for N2O.  This makes it difficult to devise effective watershed management plans for nutrients, or to constrain the global budget for greenhouse gas production in global warming models.



I propose an approach to measure denitrification and N2O production in lakes at the whole-system scale. This approach is based on high-precision measurements of dissolved gases (N2 and N2O), lake mixing models, and modeled atmospheric flux. This approach should make possible construction of very accurate budgets for annual production and emissions of these gases from lakes. Students in my laboratory will use this approach to study the roles of various biological (community structure), chemical (elemental ratios), and physical attributes of lakes as potential determinants of denitrification and N2O production rates.

"Despite Canada's abundant supply of fresh water, understanding and careful management of this resource for its many users is crucial.  The proposed research focuses on the description of transport processes within lakes and reservoirs, which form the major reserves of Canada's fresh water supply.  A description of transport processes such as circulation and irreversible mixing is essential for an understanding of a variety of water quality issues.  Examples include trapping of nutrients behind upstream reservoirs, nutrient supply to the photic zone supporting phytoplankton and fisheries food supply, effluent dispersal, and the path of contaminants (such as E. coli, Giardia and Cryptosporidium) to drinking water supply intakes.  In addition, changes to reservoir operation, to balance competing demands for water, require an understanding of the impact of these changes on lake circulation, nutrient pathways, and productivity.



The proposed research combines unmanned, untethered, underwater robot development and application with conventional field data gathering techniques to collect data that will be used to describe the circulation in ice-free and ice-covered lakes. These data will be used to develop and validate three-dimensional numerical models.  The end result of the proposed research will be an understanding of the circulation and transport dynamics of targeted lakes, as well as a thoroughly tested numerical hydrodynamic model of those lakes.  Results from targeted lakes will enhance numerical hydrodynamic modeling capabilities.  Furthermore, these hydrodynamic descriptions can be used as high quality input to numerical water quality and ecological models.

"Cancer is expected to become the number one cause of death in Canada within the next five years. During the

past few decades, the puzzle on many molecular and cellular processes involved in cancer has been elucidated,

but establishment of effective therapies for the eradication of cancer has lagged behind. Chemotherapy is still

the treatment of choice for most advanced cancers. However, it is rarely curative and mostly becomes

ineffective by drug resistance. Moreover, emergence of intolerable toxicities by chemotherapeutic agents

lowers the quality of life, significantly, in cancer patients. Immunotherapy is the more recent and

unconventional form therapy for cancer, which is also rarely curative. Recent research has provided a strong

case for the potential benefit of combined immuno and chemotherapy in the eradication of cancer. The

objective of this proposal is to design smart vaccine and drug delivery systems that can enhance the efficacy

and reduce the toxicity of immuno and chemotherapy in cancer patients and eventually lead to the eradication

of this growing disease. In this context, smart biomaterials guided by specific ligands for targeted anticancer

"Design and development of novel synthetic biomaterials that adequately solubilize therapeutic agents, release them in an appropriate rate and location, and at the same time, are safe for application in humans is the main purpose of this research. Such compounds are expected to mimic the function of biological transport systems: be recognized as self within the body, carry adequate quantities of the drug to its site of action, release their therapeutic cargo in the vicinity of their cellular and molecular targets and degrade to biocompatible components afterwards. In this context, synthetic biomaterials may be advantageous to their biological counterparts due to the ease of structural modifications, stability and safety of administration. In the first part of this project, we have developed novel self associating block copolymers consisting of poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(ester)s bearing pendent carboxyl or aromatic groups on the poly(ester) block. The developed block copolymers are bio-compatible due to the poly(ethylene oxide), biodegradable due to poly(ester),  can self associate to nanoscopic micellar structures due to the amphiphilic nature of the polymer, and allow chemical conjugation  and/or physical interaction with hydrophobic  or hydrophilic molecules within the micellar core due to the presence of different side groups on the poly(ester).  These biomaterials structurally and functionally are close to natural drug carriers in blood, i.e., lipoprotein, but have the advantage of chemical flexibility. In the second part of the project, we will pursue development of artificial viruses for the delivery of nuclearic acid based therapeutics. Development of polymeric nano-carriers that can incorporate DNA and RNA structures by electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions and deliver them to appropriate intracellular targets will be pursued. The proposed structures will be based on biocompatible and biodegradable poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(ester) block copolymers bearing targeting ligands on the poly(ethylene oxide) shell and hydrophobic and cationic groups in the poly(ester) core.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science, Faculty of","Lavasanifar, Afsaneh","RGPIN ","Biomedical engineering","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",2-5

The purpose of the magnetic field is to exert forces on the molten steel and cause it to rotate within and below the mold.  The motion of the molten metal, particularly along the solid/liquid solidification front, will act to significantly improve the quality of the solidified product.  This specific modeling goal is challenging in that it encompasses state-of-the-art methodologies taken from widely disparate fields  Specifically, the electromagnetic fields are 3-dimensional, time varying in a complex fashion, and are modified by the motion of the molten metal.  Additionally, the flow of the molten metal in the casting system is highly turbulent and prone to pulsations that cause instabilities at the free surface of the molten steel in the casting mold.  The first objective of this research is to understand, describe and electromagnetically control the flow pulsations so that the molten steel free surface can be stabilized.   The second objective is to develop electromagnetic means of increasing the amount of turbulence in certain critical  regions such that the quality of the solidified steel will be significantly improved.



This research has to potential for significant spin-offs in other application areas where the need to control molten metal flow is of paramount important.  The area of silicon crystal growth is one such area.

"La rupture du ligament crois� ant�rieur (LCA) est un traumatisme fr�quent. Le LCA gu�rit tr�s mal, comparativement aux autres ligaments du genou. Les options de reconstruction ou de remplacement du LCA sont fort limit�es et impliquent des probl�mes fonctionnels permanents au genou. Il est cliniquement tr�s justifi� d'explorer d'autres strat�gies de remplacement du LCA. Nous avons form� une �quipe � expertise multidisciplinaire, pour d�velopper un substitut du LCA par g�nie tissulaire, et �ventuellement l'implanter chez l'humain. Nous avons �tabli une technologie unique au monde (brevet�e) de production d'un LCA, enti�rement reconstruit par g�nie tissulaire. Le LCA est fait de cellules autologues vivantes, ensemens�es dans une matrice de collag�ne, ancr�e par 2 blocs osseux � ses extr�mit�s. L'exp�rimentation chez la ch�vre a r�v�l� un taux de succ�s de 100% en termes de survie et de remodelage des implants. La seconde phase d'exp�rimentation animale doit se faire chez le chien, mod�le clinique qui pose un d�fi biom�canique, car le LCA canin se rupture aussi fr�quemment que l'humain. L'int�gration permanente de notre substitut du LCA chez le chien, serait une assurance de son succ�s potentiel chez l'humain. Un projet-pilote d'un an (R�seau Canadien de l'Arthrite), nous a permis d'adapter notre technologie pour produire et greffer un substitut du LCA canin. Les objectifs sp�cifiques du projet sont: 1) Produire des substituts du LCA canin par g�nie tissulaire, 2) Comparer leurs propri�t�s histologiques et biom�caniques aux substituts de LCA de ch�vre in vitro, 3) Implanter les LCAs

canins pour 1 � 12 mois, et 4) Evaluer leurs propri�t�s histologiques et biom�caniques ex-vivo et les comparer au LCA naturel. Ce substitut pr�sente plusieurs avantages. Sa greffe sera effectu�e par arthroscopie, plut�t que par arthrotomie, sans risque de rejet. On �pargne les tendons sains du patient pour remplacer son LCA rupture, et on r�duit aussi la p�riode de r�adaptation post-op�ratoire. Il s'agit d'un projet qui va �largir nos connaissances sur la reg�n�ration et le processus de gu�rison du tissu conjonctif et dont les retomb�es cliniques seront fort utiles pour des milliers de patients au Canada et fort possiblement partout dans le monde.

"Miz1 is a transcription factor that contains 13 Zinc Fingers (ZFs). It activates the transcription of key cytostatic genes such as p15INK4b (p15) et p21CIP1 (p21) by binding to their core promoters. These two genes are cornerstones of  the cell cycle arrest program. However, in the presence of the oncoprotein c-Myc, Miz1 is unable to activate the transcription of p15 and p21. As a result, the cell cycle arrest program is abrogated. Despite the critical role of Miz1 in the expression of p15 and p21, it not known which of the 13 ZFs bind to the core promoters, how the specific binding promotes activation of transcription and if (and how) c-Myc influences this process. On the other hand, it has been shown (DNA foot-printing) that the p15 and p21 core promoters possess two Miz1 binding sites each. However, it can be shown from simple modeling that these sites are too far remote to allow the binding of one Miz1 molecule without bending or coiling of the core promoters. Alternately, it is possible that activation of the promoters necessitates that two molecules of Miz1 bind to the core promoters. the interaction of multiple ZF transcription factors has also been shown to bend core promoters. In this context, we propose a research program with the following general Objectives: 1- Determination of the Miz1 ZFs that interact specifically with the p15 and p21 core promoters, 2- Elucidation of the structural determinants of the specificity and 3- Characterization of the effect of Miz1 binding (with and without c-Myc/Max) on the topology of the p15 and p21 core promoters. Such a research program will generate the necessary data to unveil how Miz1 interacts with the p15 and p21 core promoters and if c-Myc affects Miz1-core promoter interactions.  In order to reach these objectives, we will use proteomics (enzymatic digests coupled to mass spectrometry), Circular Dichroism, NMR and Atomic force Microscopy. Such a list of experimental approaches will allow for a thorough characterization of the Miz1-core promoter interactions and provide a unique setting for the training of highly proficient structural biologists.

La protection auditive individuelle compl�te la premi�re approche car elle permet soit d'avoir une solution en attendant la r�duction du bruit � la source soit d'ajouter une r�duction de bruit suppl�mentaire quand la r�duction de bruit � la source est insuffisante.  La premi�re approche de r�duction du bruit � la source vise le probl�me du bruit d'impact g�n�r� dans des cloueuses et agrafeuses utilis�es comme outils portatifs pneumatiques par les charpentiers pour des assemblages de diverses natures ou dans le cas de machines fixes utilis�es par exemple pour l'assemblage de palettes.

"This program of research belongs to Machine Learning,  a subfield of Artificial intelligence. More specifically, this work is related to the Classification theory (also called Pattern Recognition), and to Reinforcement Learning theory  (a theory of sequential decision making under uncertainty). My long run objective is to contribute to mathematical fundaments of Machine Learning, using my expertise in other fields.

In the last decades, Machine learning has produced spectacular advances of Computer Science. One can think of Neural Nets, Support Vector Machines, the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm.

Despite these advances that come from very interesting ideas, there is a lot left to do for the  mathematical fundaments of Machine Learning.   I  think that such fundaments not only will improve our comprehension of the efficiency of actual methods, but it will provide  tools that will allow us to invent more methods or improve the ones we have. In Classification, some of our new results already permit to obtain a novel explanation of state-of-the-arts algorithms, the objective now is  to imagine  new algorithms that could come out of these new results.

The second objective of the program is to generalize those results to the RL framework. Theoretical guarantees are difficult to obtain here, because we turn from a single decision framework, as faced  in classification, to a sequence of decisions. It is possible to obtain a reduction from the latter to the former if, in the RL framework, we can get rid of the notion of the states of the process at a given time.  

Defining a stochastic process without the notion of state  involves duality theory, which says that states can be equivalently  expressed as a set of properties that they possess. Some results already exist in that direction (e.g.: Predictive State Representation (PSR)). Moreover, such notions of duality exist in a variety of areas (namely in Mathematical Topology).  In those areas, duality ideas have proven to be useful already.   We expect to obtain a theoretical general framework of the notion of duality for probabilistic processes.

"Ce programme de recherche propose la poursuite de l'�tude de la r�gulation de l'hom�ostasie glucidique, plus particuli�rement sa r�gulation au cours du je�ne et de l'exercice. Nos travaux ont montr� que les changements de la r�ponse du foie au glucagon s'accompagnent d'une augmentation du nombre de r�cepteurs au glucagon � la suite du je�ne et de l'exercice aigu et chronique. Pour ce faire, nous voulons �lucider les m�canismes et r�gulateurs responsables de la modulation des r�cepteurs au glucagon et par le fait m�me de la resensibilisation (Axe 1), m�canismes qui demeurent � �tre investigu�s.   Les voies de signalisation de ce r�cepteur et l'activit� de la prot�ine kinase AMP d�pendante (AMPk) seront �valu�es.  L'AMPk est maintenant reconnue comme un senseur m�tabolique incontournable permettant l'ajustement pr�cis des besoins et disponibilit�s �nerg�tiques cellulaires.  Au niveau h�patique, l'AMPk bloque la production h�patique de glucose (PHG) mais son r�le et les m�canismes pr�cis restent � �tre approfondis, en particulier avec le je�ne et l'exercice. Sur la base de l'expertise acquise dans la r�gulation de la PHG par le glucagon et l'insuline, un des axes de ce programme vise � caract�riser la modulation de la PHG suite au je�ne et � l'exercice en tenant compte de nouvelles hormones, les adipokines. Utilisant les adipokines comme outils majeurs de communication, les adipocytes affectent une multitude de tissus, dont le foie. Ces derni�res interviennent dans la modulation des m�tabolismes glucidique et lipidique. Peu d'�tudes � l'heure actuelle ont toutefois mis en lumi�re la r�gulation de la PHG ainsi que les m�canismes d'action impliqu�s par 3 diff�rentes adipokines: leptine, adiponectine et r�sistine.  L'exercice et le je�ne demeurent totalement � �tre explor�s.  Ainsi, nous v�rifierons si les situations physiologiques telles que le je�ne et l'exercice modifient la r�gulation de la PHG et documenterons les m�canismes.  L'apport de ces nouveaux m�canismes d'action par le glucagon et les adipokines nous aideront assur�ment � mieux comprendre les d�r�glements retrouv�s dans la perte ou la trop grande contribution du foie � l'hom�ostasie glucidique.

"On trouve de plus en plus de roseau commun (Phragmites australis) dans les marais et sur les emprises routi�res du Qu�bec et de l'Ontario. Le roseau est une gramin�e tr�s envahissante qui peut former des populations denses lorsque les conditions d'humidit� sont propices � son �tablissement. La forte production de biomasse de la plante constitue une menace potentielle pour le maintien des fonctions �cologiques des marais et pour la survie d'une flore et d'une faune diversifi�es. Le groupe multi-universitaire PHRAGMITES a �tudi�, dans un projet strat�gique ant�rieur, les modes de diss�mination de la plante. Il propose, dans le cadre d'un nouveau projet, de r�pondre aux questions suivantes qui restent sans r�ponse. Quel est la contribution relative des deux modes de diss�mination (v�g�tatif et sexu�) de la plante dans les marais ? Quel est l'impact v�ritable du roseau sur la biodiversit� des marais d'eau douce ? Cet impact est-il � ce point remarquable qu'il soit n�cessaire d'intervenir pour restaurer les sites envahis ? Si oui, de quelle mani�re les marais envahis par le roseau doivent-ils �tre restaur�s ? Les objectifs principaux de ce projet sont de quantifier les cons�quences de l'invasion d'un marais d'eau douce par le roseau sur la biodiversit� et la reproduction et de d�velopper des m�thodes de ma�trise de la plante propres � ces marais. Pour r�pondre aux objectifs, on fera 1) une �tude g�n�tique discriminant les modes de propagation dans les marais, 2) des �tudes sur la biodiversit� et la reproduction des plantes vasculaires, des poissons, des amphibiens et des oiseaux, 3) une tentative de ma�trise du roseau combinant une technique alliant la fauche � l'inondation des populations et 4) une exp�rience de lutte au r�-envahissement des marais o� le roseau aura �t� �limin�, exp�rience faisant appel � des v�g�taux comp�titeurs. Ce projet implique neuf organismes parrains directement touch�s par le probl�me du roseau envahisseur.

"Transition metal complexes play a very important role in the chemical industry through their use as catalysts. Catalysts are in fact essential for the manufacturing of more than ninety percent of the chemicals produced today, leading to much reduced energy consumption for large-scale productions. In many cases, some organic transformations and materials would also be inexistent or proceed in poor yield and selectivity without such catalysts. It is therefore critical to further develop our understanding of the requirements for catalysts to achieve high activity without decomposition at relevant process conditions. 



We are especially interested in the activation and transformation of small inert molecules, such as molecular nitrogen, the major component of air, into useful derivatives that subsequently find use in many areas, including the pharmaceutical, materials and plastic industries. A new strategy based on a new ligand family is presented. The new ligands will be used to constrain the resulting transition metal complexes into a geometry that promotes reaction through proper molecular orbital interactions. Model compounds for intermediates present during catalytic cycles will be prepared to gain insight into their chemistry. This knowledge will be used to develop new catalysts.","Physical sciences","Advancement of knowledge",Chemistry,"Lavoie, Gino","RGPIN ","Metal and organometallic chemistry","Inorganic chemistry","Chimie inorganique",2-3
"Our main objective for our next research program is to understand how the liver gets infiltrated with fat under nutritional circumstances (westerner high-fat diet) and after menopause. We also try to understand how regular physical exercise contravenes these effects. There are three approaches that we privilege. We are first interested in understanding on a molecular basis how the synthesis of new lipids and its oxidation are respectively stimulated and reduced in liver under high-fat diets and following withdrawal of estrogens in rats. We are also interested, in a second approach, in testing specific hypotheses related to exportation of lipids from the liver. This is an important consideration since it determines circulating blood lipids. In a third step, we are interested in evaluating the impact of a reduction in estrogens (i.e. menopause) on a specific pathway involving oxytocin hormone and atrial natriuretic peptide liberated from the heart. We postulate that these two hormones have a protective effect on the liver. Withdrawal of estrogens will reduce the action of this pathway and causes deleterious effects such as inflammation. On the whole, our next research program should lead to new information regarding how diets enriched in fat leads to accumulation of fat in liver and how and why withdrawal of estrogens, as seen in post-menopausal women, also leads to infiltration of lipids in liver.

"Eukaryotic cells, including human cells, are divided into compartments called organelles that have evolved to perform specialized functions while protecting the rest of the cell from potentially harmful activities. This partition into distinct organelles presents cells with big challenges in terms of coordination of cellular activities with cell division and with changes in their surrounding environment. Such coordination requires the presence of specialized circuits that relay extracellular signals to intracellular organelles. These intracellular signaling circuits are composed of protein hardware that conveys signals through reversible protein modifications, including protein phosphorylation. Hence, protein kinases, the enzymes that catalyze protein phosphorylation, act as molecular switches to transduce signals. Most of our knowledge regarding signaling mechanisms is limited to the initial signal reception and integration at the plasma membrane. However, similar signaling devices reside on intracellular membranes of organelles, notably those involved in the regulated transport of membranes and macromolecules via vesicle-based membrane traffic (endosomes), but their role in coordination of membrane traffic is not understood. This research program seeks to understand how human cells coordinate membrane traffic in order to cope with cellular needs and adjust to changes in their surrounding. We will investigate key tyrosine kinases residing within a specialized compartment called the perinuclear recycling compartment. Their role in regulation of membrane traffic will be addressed during fundamental cellular processes requiring the regulated delivery of membrane components to specific regions of the cell, including cell division. The proposed research aims at understanding a basic unresolved issue in cell biology with potential links to human diseases characterized by an inability of cells to properly respond to external cues, including proliferative and degenerative diseases.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Health, education and social services","Biologie m�dicale","Lavoie, Josee","RGPIN ","Signal transduction","Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",1-5

"Context: Emotions have been shown to influence recognition memory concomitantly with Event-Related Potentials and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) techniques. These studies have brought interesting discoveries in that field, showing that both pleasant and unpleasant images evoked amygdala activity during encoding, correlated with later enhancement of recognition memory. Despite these recent advances ERPs and fMRI have mostly been utilized independently. In the current research program, we are proposing to merge these two techniques to better track the temporal dynamic (ERP) as well as the structural (fMRI) dimension underlying emotional memory.

Goals and hypotheses: Our general aim is to study the brain activity that underlies the processing of emotions and memory performances. Our specific goal is to investigate if a particular type of emotional material activates brain activity differently in different types of memory tasks.  

Methodology: Sixty female participants will be assigned to three experiments. In the first experiment (explicit memory), participants will have to detect images that were present (old) and also the images that were not present (new) during the study phase.  In the second experiment (implicit memory), the same protocol will be administered but they will need to evaluate the emotional content of each stimulus. In the third experiment, another cohort of 20 participants, not previously exposed to our photographic material, will be instructed to categorize remembered pictures (old) as living being or non living thing with one of two button press (test phase). The ERPs will be recorded during the presentation of the slides with 64 tin electrodes mounted in a nylon cap. After the ERP recordings, the subjects will enter the fMRI to repeat an analog task.

Impact and implications: The present program will allow investigating whether some stages are more affected by emotional valence and arousal. This will allow merging and, then, correlating ERP with fMRI results in order to understand the cortical as well as the subcortical generators involved in emotional memory.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge",Psychiatrie,"Lavoie, Marc","RGPGP ","Behavioural neuroscience",Psychology,Psychologie,2-5

"Recently, there has been an increasing amount of social and political pressure placed on transport industries, in particular aviation, to reduce their impact on the environment and contribution to global warming. Active flow control has been identified as a key factor to produce the paradigm shift required to meet increasingly stringent environmental standards on emissions, while sustaining growth. The focus of the research to be supported by the proposed equipment is to investigate the fundamental flow dynamics of separated and wall-bounded shear layers, and how such phenomena can be manipulated to improve flow characteristics in order to reduce drag and harmful emissions. The overarching aim is the development and implementation of active flow control strategies, either open or closed-loop, in an experimental framework, with a view to deployment in industry.



In the present proposals, an additional working section is requested for the new state-of-the-art low turbulence intensity wind tunnel located in the Flow Control and Experimental Turbulence (FCET) laboratory at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS). This proposal requests funds to purchase a second working section that is interchangeable with the present one. This upgrade will permit more students to perform experiments in this unique facility since apparatus setup, alignment and/or modifications can be performed in the second section, whilst experiments on another model can be ongoing inside the wind tunnel. The proposed equipment is critical to the continued and timely advancement of the research program of the applicant and his team. It is anticipated that the proposed equipment will involve 4 Ph.D. and 8 M.Sc. students over the next five years. These students will gain important skills and expertise that are in high demand in many technological sectors in Canada, in particular the aerospace industry.

Active flow control has been identified as a key factor to produce the paradigm shift required to meet increasingly stringent environmental standards on emissions, while sustaining economical growth. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to investigate fundamental fluid mechanics, dynamical systems and control issues in order to improve flow characteristics (e.g. lower drag) via feedback control. The primary focus of the present proposal is concerned with actuation issues for the purpose of cancelling the instability that leads to bypass transition in a laminar boundary layer. This control will be performed using an array of

single-dielectric-discharge plasma actuators designed to induce pairs of counter rotating vortices of known strength and duration on demand inside a transitional boundary layer. This type of actuators offer a number of attractive features that make them ideal for the implementation in an experimental framework and for eventual deployment in industry.

The aim is to identify important basic flow dynamics and instabilities in these flows as a precursor to their control. This aspect of the work is closely linked with the development of sensors, actuators and controllers necessary to enable a favorable alteration of the characteristics of these flows. Particularly, the following desirable flow control objectives are sought; 1) control of separation to increase lift-to-drag ratio or base pressure of aerodynamics and bluff bodies such as airfoils, backwards facing steps, and cavities; and 2) delay of boundary layer transition.



The proposed research program will involve 3 PhD and 5 MSc students. These students will gain important skills and expertise that are in high demand in many technological sectors in Canada, in particular the aerospace industry. Canadian companies such as Bombardier, and Pratt and Whitney Canada will benefit directly from the proposed research and the highly qualified personnel that it will train.

"The proposed research is important to all disciplines that use spatial data because it will develop new and improved methodologies for analyzing spatial data, and thus make effective use of spatial data that have been collected routinely across disciplines.  Research that applies spatial analysis has increased remarkably in many disciplines as more geographically-referenced data are becoming available.  Traditional spatial analysis adopts a frequentist statistical approach, which has the limitation of inability to fit complex spatial models.  One important development of spatial analysis in recent years is to use a Bayesian statistical approach to analyze spatial data, referred to a Bayesian Spatial Analysis (BSA).  Research has shed lights on the capability of this new approach in fitting more complex spatial models to tackle traditional problems of spatial analysis including missing data, data uncertainty, measurement errors, spatial dependence, and data integration.  Compared to the UK and US, BSA is rarely used in Canada.  The long term goal of our proposed research is to advance methodologies of BSA to improve our ability to analyze geographic data reliably, provide BSA training to students, promote the applications of BSA, and improve the overall standard of geographic research in Canada.  Our short term goal is to develop BSA methodologies that would enable the integration of geographically-referenced individual and aggregated data in small-area research to improve the reliability of geographic studies.  We will focus on developing methods for research in the fields of public health and crime, which are currently most in need of improved spatial methodologies for understanding geographic variation of disease/crime outcomes.  Our research findings will be shared with two regions of public health and police in Ontario who have expressed interests in and agreed to provide data for our research.  However, the BSA methodologies developed will be applicable not only in public health and crime, but also in environmental science and other applied science research.",Environment,Environment,"Planning, School of","Law, Jane","RGPIN ","Geographical information","Geographical information","Information g�ographique",1-5

"Increasingly public safety is dependent upon the safe operation of computer control systems in anti-lock brakes 

on cars, fly-by-wire controls on airplanes, medical devices and other systems. These systems rely upon the 

correct operation of their software to provide previously unimaginable benefits to humanity. Therefore we 

would like to have some sort of ""proof"" or ""formal verification"" that the software will operate correctly and not 

endanger the public. Unfortunately, construction and formal verification of safety critical real-time software is 

very costly, requiring significant time of specially trained personnel. As a result, mathematical proofs of 

software correctness are typically only used by industry in the most safety critical control software when it is 

mandated by a regulatory body to insure public safety. To make the construction of provably correct real-time 

software less labour intensive and more cost effective, the proposed research will create a library of 

pre-verified software components that meet commonly occurring real-time requirements. The library will 

consist of software components and portable theorems about their properties. By leveraging the proofs of the 

properties of the individual sub-components, engineers will be able to easily prove properties of larger 

components as they are constructed from the sub-components. The portable theorems will appear in an XML 

based standard to allow the use of multiple verification environments so that the most appropriate environment 

can be used to establish a property of a design. Theorem provers can be used for proofs of the software's logical correctness while computer algebra systems can be used to check how the software will interact with a 

controlled system's continuous dynamics. By allowing the designers to reason at a higher level, using the 

appropriate tools, the pre-verified real-time software library will open up the possiblity of creating formally 

verified software systems to more companies at a more reasonable cost.

"Organizations of all sizes rely on networks for their operations. Network monitoring is the real-time collection

and analysis of network resources, traffic, and capabilities in order to maximize the security, availability,

reliability, and performance of network resources and the interconnected systems. Network monitoring in this

proposal involves the collection of network traffic data using network monitors, data warehousing, and the

analysis and user interface to the data to detect and respond to issues. Network monitoring allows an

organization to reduce its network costs, improve performance, and reduce maintenance overhead.

This proposal investigates data warehousing optimization for an organization that provides a network

monitoring service. The data generated by the network monitors are real-time data streams that must be

filtered, archived, and analyzed in real-time. The organization currently uses an open source database system

for archiving the data and several optimizations to store and query it efficiently. For each client that uses the

network monitoring service, dedicated or virtualized hardware is allocated for data processing. The costs for

data processing represent a significant business cost and limit the scalability of the approach. The goal is to

improve the organization's data warehousing performance in order to allow for more efficient processing, larger

network clients, and reduce the operational hardware costs. These improvements will be realized by

technology transfer of research on real-time and stream databases to improve the current system.

Undergraduate and graduate students will conduct the research and implementation. The research

collaboration will result in potential improvements being proposed and evaluated on company data which will

then be implemented in the production system by organization engineers. Improved data warehousing

techniques will make this company more profitable and competitive, and allow the technology to be used in

larger network installations.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Advancement of knowledge","Okanagan - Psychology & Computer Science","Lawrence, Ramon","EGP   ","Database management","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",1-1
"Organizations are drowning in data. The basic question is how can we manage all this data and turn it into valuable information?  Data is scattered around different systems, in different formats, and controlled by various organizations. It is like a giant jigsaw puzzle.  In order to answer questions, you need pieces from various places, and only when the pieces are put together can meaningful results be produced.  The key to turning data into information are the tools that allow you to construct the whole picture from the individual pieces.   This proposal aims to develop the algorithms and associated tools to help all users find, query, and integrate data from many data sources.  The approaches are applicable to the integration of medical information, business data, and the dissemination and integration of the vast amounts of scientific data.

   Database integration is the process of combining data from multiple data sources into a single unified information system.  Although advances have been made including integration architectures and schema matching algorithms, database integration remains a challenging and human-intensive problem.  One of the major challenges is the construction of an integrated view combining the information in all data sources. 

    The proposed research is to develop techniques for supporting rapid, dynamic integration of database systems.  The research is in two areas: query processing and optimization for integration systems and ontology-based schema matching and merging.  Evaluating and ordering joins in distributed query processing is critical to achieving high performance.  Research will be performed on how to improve the hash-based early join algorithms and utilize them with optimizers specific for the integration environment. The second area of study is using ontologies (domain representations suitable for computer processing) to improve the accuracy of matching schemas.  The goal is to support iterative schema merging and refinement to produce an integrated view.  The research will use the previously constructed Unity integration architecture for experimentation and evaluation of join algorithms, query optimization heuristics, and schema merging approaches.

"The use of a vast array of organic chemicals in modern society has led to a significant increase in the level of organic contaminant concentration levels in wastewater streams, and, ultimately, drinking water sources. Xenobiotics are a class of chemical compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylphenols, organotins, volatile organic compounds, pesticides and heavy metals, foreign to the body of living organisms and resistant to environmental degradation. A number of xenobiotics, characterized by increased risk for the environment and human health, are listed as priority substances of the EC Water Framework Directive and are on the US EPA Contaminant Candidate List. Some of these substances are endocrine disrupting compounds.



UV technologies are playing an increasing role in removing xenobiotic contaminants of drinking water through UV photolysis (UVP) and advanced oxidation processes (AOP), with some research focusing on the use of UVP/AOP for wastewater. UVP is the process where chemical compounds are broken down by UV photons. UV-based AOP refers to the process where UV light photolyzes a pre-dissolved oxidant, typically hydrogen peroxide or ozone, to create hydroxyl radicals which oxidize organic contaminants into less toxic compounds. While the chemical mechanisms for UVP/AOP have been studied significantly, the coupled dynamics of the processes in a UV reactor are complex and key parameters impacting overall system performance are not well understood. Practical implementation of this promising technology is hampered by this lack of understanding. For a given water quality and performance target, system engineers have few tools for making design decisions such as peroxide dosing levels and UV reactor sizing. The objective of this study is to develop numerical models of the nonlinear dynamics of UVP/AOP within full scale reactors to better characterize the systems. It is hoped that improved characterization of the systems for contaminant treatment will facilitate acceptance of the technology, with the holistic benefit of improved protection of the environment and public health.",Water,"Transportation systems and services","Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry","Lawryshyn, Yuri","RGPIN ","Chemical engineering","Chemical engineering","G�nie chimique",2-4

"Volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits contain some of Canada's most significant sources of copper, lead, zinc, gold and silver, and are thought to have formed within submarine volcanoes similar to those presently forming on the modern seafloor. This proposed research will examine deposits hosted within ancient seafloor volcanic rocks and will investigate mineral and chemical changes associated with the interaction of hot metal-rich fluids with seawater, sedimentary and volcanic rocks.  This research will focus on the origin, formation and setting of these submarine sedimentary and volcanic rocks.  By improving our understanding of VMS deposits and their associated rocks, I will be able to provide predictive methods for the discovery, exploration, and exploitation of these important metal resources. 

This research would establish one of very few laboratories quantitatively analyzing trace elements in sulfide minerals from VMS deposits. Additionally, this proposed research will help establish the World's only laboratory routinely measuring Se, Cu, and Te isotopic ratios in geological material from ore systems. It is anticipated that through the application of these new laboratories by my students, collaborators and I, coupled with traditional geological methods of fieldwork, petrography and traditional isotope systems, we will provide an immediate growth in our knowledge on the distribution of trace elements in VMS systems on the seafloor and those in the geological record. As in most new method development, it is anticipated that the knowledge gained in this research will be applicable outside ore deposits research and pertinent to Earth System Science as a whole.

"It is well recognized that male infertility represents a major problem for mammalian reproduction and, in turn, can endanger numerous socio-economic areas of human activities. In this context, the sustained efforts towards improving animal breeding and both the size and quality of our livestock are reinforced by the global pressure on increasing feeding capacities. Thus, it is essential that a better description of the components of the fertilization process be acquired so as to relate it to the spermatozoa fertilization capacities and to its potential for successful breeding endeavors. Surprisingly, relatively few proteins at the surface of the spermatozoa have nowadays been conclusively identified as playing a definite role or displaying a pivotal importance for successful reproduction. In this application, we will take advantage of new powerful molecular approaches to identify known and novel components in or associated with the membrane of freshly ejaculated bovine spermatozoa. This identification ultimately will be applied in the breeding industry through allowing the determination of the semen fertilization potential enabling one to select higher quality sperm. Concomitantly, in addition to better understanding this biological process, it is also our goal to identify proteins positively and negatively contributing to the process of sperm cryopreservation (cold storage), an area of great economic importance considering that, nowadays, most breeding is accomplished through artificial insemination using frozen spermatozoa. To do this, we will focus on economically important species such pig, sheep, horse or bovine species. Taken together, reaching these objectives could contribute to an increased knowledge which could directly benefit breeding and rearing of cattle.

"Interactions between DNA and proteins are responsible for many biological processes in the cell. The affinity and specificity of these interactions can be exploited for bioanalytical assays that make use of DNA-protein binding. The primary objective of this research is to develop novel bioanalytical technology combining DNA-protein affinity recognition, capillary electrophoresis separation, and laser induced fluorescence detection. Both established and novel affinity probes, including antibodies, DNA damage recognition proteins, and short synthetic DNA molecules (aptamers), will be examined for their ability to bind with the target molecules. To assay for DNA damage, for example, DNA will be isolated from cells and incubated with a fluorescent probe recognizing the damage. The complex of the affinity probe with the damaged DNA will be separated from other molecules by capillary electrophoresis and its concentration will be quantified by laser induced fluorescence. 

      The concept and strategy of the innovative combination of affinity DNA-protein interactions with CE/LIF are not limited to assays for DNA damage and proteins. They are also applicable to many other groups of compounds of biochemical, environmental, and clinical importance. The proposed research presents significant analytical advances, addressing several important issues in affinity DNA-protein interactions, electrophoresis separation, and fluorescence detection of biomolecules. The innovative analytical technologies will significantly impact research on cancer, molecular biology, and toxicology. The research program provides excellent training opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows.

"The overall objective is to develop multivariate methods for modelling environmental processes where available data include both monitoring measurements and output from deterministic (physical) models. Although data from both sources attempt to replicate reality, they have very different characteristics. The monitoring data attempt to replicate the micro environment whereas the physical model represents the macro environment (eg. MAQSIP: 6km x 6km grid cells). The environmental fields under consideration may include multiple pollutants (ie. Multivariate responses), and generally have both spatial and temporal correlation structures as well as being non-stationary and non-Gaussian.  A variety of research problems will be studied to incorporate these features in the modelling of environmental space-time processes. 

The significance of the research would be new general statistical theories for environmental processes which can have a wide variety of applications. These include improved exposure assessment for health impact studies; improved network monitoring to best protect human population; and enhanced environmental risk management through, for examples, forecasting drought and flood, as well as extreme climate conditions such as hurricanes. It is also possible to provide different scales of resolution for the deterministic model output, thus avoiding the computational burden.

"High energy processes can be studied by studying neutron stars. Neutron stars are numerous in our galaxy and are significant generators of high energy particles and radiation. This is due to their strong magnetic fields (up to several thousand billion Gauss), strong gravity, and fast spin rates (up to 600 times per second). Observations of high energy radiation from neutron stars are carried out using x-ray telescopes in Earth orbit. These are then compared to theory by means of making computer models of the gas, radiation,

gravity, and magnetic fields around the neutron star. The observations are of enough detail that the properties of the neutron star and its environment can be deduced from the models. For example, in the binary system Hercules X-1, the accretion disk shape has only been recently understood, and the pre-eclipse dips are not understood, so are currently being investigated: this is inspiring new theoretical work. In addition to neutron stars, observational consequences of quark stars are being studied with possible applications to soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGR), anomalous X-ray pulsars (XRP) and gamma-ray bursts (GRB).



Another location where high energy processes are important is in a supernova remnant: the stellar ejecta, hot cavity and outer dense shell produced after a massive star explodes. A few hundred to several thousand years after the explosion a supernova remnant of a few to tens of lightyears across shines brightly in radiowaves and x-rays. The properties of supernova remnants are now being much better understood using new observations with radio telescopes and x-ray telescopes. Only with the latest x-ray telescopes have the instruments been good enough to get detailed information on the properties of the million degree hot gas and of the relativistic particles which also emit x-rays. Modeling of physical processes in supernova remnants is leading to a new understanding of these objects, and also of the gas and relativistic particles in our galaxy.

"Chemists and many other scientists use techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate molecular motions in solutions at uniform composition. The proposed diffusion research is different. We study gradient diffusion processes driven by changes in chemical composition. This kind of diffusion is important in a wide range of practical applications because it provides mass transport and mixing on the molecular level, and therefore controls the rates of many physical and chemical processes, such as chemical reactions, crystal growth and dissolution, gas absorption, detergency, chemical signaling, and the spread of pollutants. We measure diffusion by monitoring the dispersion of solution samples injected into flowing carrier solutions of different composition. This proven technique will be used to study multicomponent solutions of polymers, electrolytes, proteins, detergents, microemulsions and other materials of scientific and technological interest. Diffusion in these systems is strongly coupled. A diffusing protein molecule, for example, can transport hundreds or even thousands of salt ions. Protein diffusion will be measured at different pH values to provide new information about transport in biological systems, such as proton-coupled transport. To help understand why diffusion is strongly coupled, osmotic pressure measurements will be used to determine the fundamental thermodynamic driving forces for diffusion. Another goal is to accurately describe propagating chemical waves by including migration in the electric field generated by the transport of ions of different mobilities. Laser light scattering is frequently used to characterize polymers, proteins and other colloids by analyzing microscopic concentration fluctuations produced by diffusion. Our work will establish the correct interpretation of popular light-scattering measurements by comparing light-scattering and gradient diffusion data for a series of well defined multicomponent solutions. To solve the longstanding problem of measuring gradient diffusion in many-component systems, infrared spectroscopy will be used for solute-specific detection across diffusion profiles, which has considerable advantages over conventional bulk refractive-index profiling.

"For over 3 billion years, microbes have dominated the planet in terms of pure abundance and diversity, yet the fundamental and innovative properties of microbes are the least understood of all extant organisms. Micro-eukaryotes are morphologically and genetically complex, having nuclei, endomembrane systems, symbiotically acquired organelles and elaborate cytoskeletons supporting a vast array of specialized cell extensions and behaviors. Despite being composed of only a single cell, each micro-eukaryote is a universe in itself, and recent advances in our understanding of these organisms have dramatically altered long-held views about the diversity of cells. Accordingly, the proposed research program is designed to explore this foreign world in order to help unravel the total composition, interrelationships and history of life on earth. Individual projects will span an extremely broad sampling of eukaryotic diversity in order to resolve large-scale patterns of cell character evolution. The research program will continue to study, in parallel, four main groups of micro-eukaryotes that encompass what are arguably the three most dissimilar modes of eukaryotic life on the planet: predation, photoautotrophy, and parasitism. The independent but corresponding patterns of morphological change in marine predatory flagellates, such as euglenids, dinoflagellates and cryomonads, represent an ideal comparative system for investigating the constraints and reoccurring innovations in cell evolution. The fourth group of micro-eukaryotes offers compelling insights into one of the most enigmatic evolutionary transformations in the history of life: the origin of obligate intracellular (apicomplexan) parasites from free-living, photoautotrophic ancestors. Despite being infamous as pathogens of humans and livestock (e.g. Plasmodium and Toxoplasma), most of apicomplexan diversity is thriving in the world's oceans. The origin and early evolution of apicomplexans will be addressed by exploring the diversity and molecular phylogeny of marine gregarines, which are large and dynamic parasites that inhabit the extracellular spaces of marine invertebrates and insects.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Botany,"Leander, Brian","RGPIN ",Cytoskeleton,"Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",1-5
"Cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks, strokes, aneurysms and valvular disorders are believed to be partly a cellular response to biomechanical forces.  My laboratory has developed the techniques to use three dimensional tissue culture models to better investigate the response of endothelial cells, leukocytes and platelets to realistic hemodynamics. Currently these models are limited to the study of shear stress as a stimulus owing to our assumption of rigid wall mechanics.  In vivo, the artery wall is compliant and, particularly in the case of coronary arteries, pulled and stretched by surrounding tissue during the cardiac cycle.  The objective of the proposed work is to add cyclic strain and compliance to our existing dynamic cell culture models. Specifically, we will answer the questions: 1. Does vessel compliance and cyclic strain alter the local response of endothelial cells?  2. Is the tethering and attachment of blood components to the endothelium affected by compliance and cyclic strain?  This research will provide a better understanding of atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to better treatment options.

"The cytoplasm of the vertebrate oocyte plays a key role in regulating or modifying early gene expression by an embryo that develops from that oocyte, and can influence the phenotype of post-embryonic stages.  Despite decades of intensive research in mammals leading to the development of reproductive biotechnologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) the epigenetic influences of the ooplasm factors are still poorly understood; embryo deformity rates in IVF-derived mammalian embryos remain high.  Much less is known about the role of ooplasm in the early ontogeny of fishes, but since the embryo of most fish species is totally reliant on nutrients in the egg yolk, the influence of the ooplasm is likely to be significant.  Moreover, some maternal hormones and some contaminants that are known to disrupt endocrine physiology in adult fish are transferred from maternal blood to the oocytes during the maturation of fish ovaries; this uncontrolled delivery of biologically active hormones and endocrine disrupting compounds may have significant consequences for the early development of the embryo either by acting on hormone receptors, or by inhibiting the clearance of native hormones.  We propose to examine the impact of the stress hormone, cortisol, on the expression of key growth-related genes during early embryogenesis; egg cortisol content varies with the maternal plasma hormone levels (and hence stress levels) of the brood-stock, but its actions on embryo development is poorly understood.  In addition, we propose to examine the effect of two classes of endocrine disrupting compounds, a xenoestrogen (bisphenol A) and an activator of the hepatic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (TCDD) on the expression of the same genes. The effects of these factors on the acute stress-response, and the expression of growth related genes will be examined in embryos and early stage juveniles.

"Global human population has doubled since 1950, largely due to the green revolution in which a 10-fold increase in agricultural application of fertilizer has doubled food production. These farming practices have also raised soil phosphorus (P) content by 200% or more and have created conditions in many sentinel ecosystems in which agricultural soils are now saturated with P, will remain so for centuries, and supply freshwaters with excess P.  Under these conditions, supplies of nitrogen (N) and light energy (E) appear to regulate lake production, water quality degradation, and the development of toxic algal blooms.  Unfortunately, because N fertilization has also increased 15-fold since 1970, and because more than half of this N is added as urea, a chemical form of N which selectively promotes toxic cyanobacteria, there exists the possibility that continued agricultural development will lead to continental-scale outbreaks of toxic and possibly carcinogenic algae.  Given that ~1 billion people already lack clean water, we seek substantial funding to develop a predictive understanding of the consequences of these changes for humans and freshwaters throughout Canada and the world.

          We propose to develop a new paradigm for future lake eutrophication based on three component projects.  First, we will add growth-saturating levels of urea-N to a P-rich experimental lake to test the hypothesis that this form of N preferentially stimulates both growth and toxicity of cyanobacteria.  Second, we will investigate how N diversion from a chain of P-rich, N-limited lakes may improve water quality and reduce outbreaks of toxic algae.  Finally, we will combine whole-lake and catchment-scale mass balances of N and P with high-resolution paleoecological analyses to determine how the physical structure of lakes (thermal stratification) may affect N control of eutrophication over a large landscape.  Together these components will provide managers, scientists and the public with a new understanding of the controls of future water-quality degradation.

"The global scientific objective of this project is to develop new tools for the elaboration of important nitrogen-containing molecules, using one-pot and transition metal-catalyzed processes. The creation of C-N bonds is one of the important challenges in synthetic organic chemistry, as these bonds are found in many molecules possessing important biological properties. Although a number of methods have been previously reported, improvements of the existing technologies as well as developments of novel approaches are still highly desirable.  Our goal is not only to develop more efficient synthetic strategies, but also to converge towards greener processes, by using new catalyzed-reactions, and new multicatalytic strategies, which considerably decrease the amount of required reagents and solvents, thus producing less waste and byproducts.  

The success of this proposal will afford novel strategies based on transition metal-catalyzed reactions for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing molecules. Many aspects of catalysis, including working with transition metal complexes and developing new green processes will be studied, thereby providing important scientific advances in this area.  More specifically, the successful outcome of the proposed research will afford new methodologies to access to a wide variety of valuable molecules, including chiral amines, aziridines and other heterocycles.

"Summary

In Canada, wildfire control costs a total of more than $ 3.3 billion, with over $ 135 million of property losses between 1970 and 1998. Up to now, fire monitoring has been conducted primarily using weather data, which are point-source measurements. A promising alternative is remote sensing. The short-term objective of the proposed research is to define remotely-sensed indices to map Fire Weather codes and indices from MODIS optical and thermal infrared images as well as RADARSAT-2/ALOS-PALSAR SAR images in the case of grasslands, boreal forests and Mediterranean forests. The long-term objective is to model the relationship between the fire indices and image variables. The remote sensing derived FWI codes and indices maps will be applied to fire behaviour models for determining ignition probability and fuel flammability. Ultimately, they will be correlated to fire occurrence maps. The grassland study will be coupled with J. Buckley's research at the Royal Military College. Using the same study areas (Grassland National Park and CFB Shilo), RADARSAT-2 images will be used by J. Buckley to map grassland cover types and by me, to map FWI indices and codes. Collaboration with J. Wilmhurst (Parks Canada) will also occur. The Mediterranean study will be coupled to a larger project called FIRE PARADOX that I am invited to collaborate to. It is funded under the 6th European Union framework program. The boreal forest study will be done in collaboration with two U.S. laboratories in the frame of a larger project on the use of remote sensing for fuel consumption and emission mapping. RADARSAT-2 SAR images will be provided by the Canadian Space Agency. ALOS-PALSAR images will be provided by the collaborating US laboratories. The research addresses priorities of Parks Canada, of the department of National Defence and of the Canadian Interagency for Forest Fire Committee, and FIRE PARADOX. The research is novel because it is the first time that polarimetric SAR images will be used for mapping FWI codes and indices.",Aerospace,"Transportation systems and services","Forestry and Environmental Management, Faculty of","Leblon, Brigitte","RGPIN ","Remote sensing","Geographical information","Information g�ographique",3-5

"Climate change and its consequences are one of the most important issues humanity will have to face in the coming decades. Reliable modeling can only come from an accurate knowledge of the composition of the atmosphere. This program is aimed at the development of a powerful in-situ instrument to detect pollutants in the atmosphere using a variant of tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. The miniature dimension of the instrument will allow an easy deployment on small balloon payloads or aircrafts for atmospheric measurement campaigns. Additionally, this new instrument will find many applications in industry (e.g., leak detection, process control systems, etc), in agriculture (e.g., emission from soils, livestock, etc) and in forensic science (e.g., detection of explosives, narcotics and other chemical substances, etc). 

Standard in-situ technique consists of a set of tunable diode lasers, an absorbing medium and a detector. When the laser frequency is tuned over the absorption lines of a gas, a part of the laser intensity is lost when the laser beam passes through the gas. The remaining intensity is measured by the detector at the exit of the absorbing medium and analyzed to obtain the concentration, temperature and velocity of the gaz. Despite its great sensitivity, the deployment of this technique for atmospheric measurements has been limited because it requires a long path length through heavy multi-pass cell.

My plan is to use a new spectroscopic technique based on the whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) of silica micro-resonators to develop a portable sensitive infrared spectrometer for in-situ detection of trace gases.  The WGMs are resonance modes in which light is confined, by internal reflection, at the surface of a circular micro-resonator. When the resonator is set inside a gas vapour and its WGM tuned over an absorption frequency of the gas, an energy loss occurs by a non-radiative transfer between the resonator and the neighbouring molecules. As this non-radiative transfer rate is considerably higher than the radiative absorption rate, we can obtain, by analyzing the energy loss, a sensitivity equivalent to those obtained by a bulk device.","Climate and atmosphere",Environment,Physics,"LeBris, Karine","RGPIN ","Atomic and molecular studies",Physics,Physique,1-1

"The many ecoregions across the Canadian landscape provide the diversity underpinning our natural heritage.  The fundamental visual and biological character of any ecoregion is set by its vegetation, from barren tundra through expansive grasslands to dense forests.  Plant ecology has a long history of descriptive studies classifying native vegetation into different plant communities arrayed along gradients in light, water and nutrient availability.  Through studies of plant function and adaptation, we understand to a lesser degree why particular species prosper in some environments and die out in others.  This knowledge is critical to developing well-founded policies for the sustainable management of our forests and wildlife habitat, and for protecting endangered plant and animal species. Descriptive studies unfortunately do not prepare us well for predicting how plant communities will respond to climate change and invasion by non-native species.  Plant ecologists now are challenged to develop objective, quantitative methods for predicting the responses of plant communities to changes in their environment and in the regional species pool from which species in the community are drawn. These challenges organize my research program.

     I will use plant communities in a tract of old-growth, northern-hardwood forest reserve that has exceptionally high plant and habitat diversity(www.mcgill.ca/gault/) to test and refine two models predicting the distribution and abundance of plant species along environmental gradients in the forest understory.  One model predicts the distribution and abundance of species in a given environment or habitat based on the value of key traits that characterize the adaptations of species in the region.  The other predicts the ability of specific non-native trees to colonize environments in the reserve in response to ongoing changes in climate, especially the seasonal conditions that determine when trees leaf out, flower and fruit.  Our studies in this floristically rich protected area will advance scientific understanding of plant adaptation and community dynamics and also serve as a bellwether to stimulate policy discussions in the areas of climate change and biodiversity conservation.

"Self-assembly of the papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) coat protein (CP) into a highly ordered and crystalline flexible rod is a complex process that involves several conformational changes and interacting domains within the CP subunits. 

We propose to elucidate the mechanism of self assembly of the coat protein of this virus. 



The long term objectives of this research program are: 1) to reinforce our understanding of the self-assembly process of the PapMV CP; 2) to unravel the mechanism of virus self-assembly in planta and; 3) to translate our understanding of the platform into topical antimicrobial applications for commercial production by specific engineering of the PapMV CP. 



The development of anti-microbial molecule could be used as an alternative to antibiotics. The novel nanoparticle could be used for topical use to improve (wound) healing by decreasing the risk of infectious contamination. Due to their increased stability, antimicrobial NLPs could probably be stored for long periods at room temperature and still provide long lasting anti-bacterial activity. The PapMV platform is a good example of a made-in-Canada nanoparticle that has potentially useful commercial antimicrobial applications that fulfill an unmet need for the Canadian and world populations seeking alternatives to antibiotics.

"Conjugated polymers combine the interesting electrical and optical properties of traditional semiconductors with the processing advantages and mechanical properties of traditional synthetic polymers. This research field is aiming to set up the so-called plastic electronics where micro-electronic devices are printed on flexible substrates. Such applications include the fabrication of light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells, electrochromic devices but the present project will focus on the development of new printable, low-cost, field-effect transistors. We will investigate a particular class of conjugated polymers, namely poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives, which has been invented by this research team. New poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives will be designed and synthesized to optimize their hole and possibly, electron mobilities as well as keeping them air-stable and processable. The most promising polymers will be scaled-up in collaboration with an industrial partner and will be tested by this research team. This project should therefore lead to the develop of highly efficient and printable polymeric transistors that should compete with the existing and relatively costly silicon-based technologies.","Manufacturing processes and products","Manufacturing processes and products",Chimie,"Leclerc, Mario","STPGP ","Materials science and technology","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",1-3

"Optical, Electrochemical, and Electrical Properties of Novel Conjugated Oligomers and Polymers.



Conjugated polymers have received a lot of attention from both academic and industrial laboratories since they combine the best features of metals or inorganic materials with those of synthetic plastics. This synergy not only makes these new materials useful in existing electronic and optical devices (light-emitting diodes, transistors, solar cells, etc.) but also creates completely new opportunities. Along these lines, we intend to synthesize and characterize new electroactive and photoactive polymeric supports for the direct and specific detection of proteins, cells, etc. This project should lead to the development of novel efficient and simple tools for biomedical research. In another project, we plan to develop ionic nitrogen-containing conjugated polymers.  It is anticipated that these usually amorphous materials may self-assemble through non-covalent interactions to yield well-organized pi-stacked supramolecular structures.  Pi-stacking is an important feature to improve the electrical transport in these organic materials. For instance, these studies should contribute to the design of more efficient transistors and solar cells. Finally, we propose to design, synthesize, and characterize completely new conjugated oligomers and polymers incorporating unusual heteroatoms (B, Ga, In, etc.). These hybrid polymers should exhibit interesting and tunable physical properties. In particular, stable negative charge carriers should be created upon electrochemical or acid-base reactions.



All these studies should therefore shed some light on the physical properties of new conjugated oligomers and polymers within different integrated molecular systems. This work should pave the way to the development of novel biosensors and plastic electro-optical devices.

"The brain cells called neurons extend two types of long processes, dendrites and axon. The dendrites are the receptive compartment where communication between neurons occurs through a specialized structure, the synapse. The axon is the transmitter compartment that propagates electrical impulses to other neurons. Neurons undergo dendritic and axonal morphological changes during memory, learning and adaptation. These changes involves two phenomena : 1- a reorganization of the architectural elements of the neuron called the cytoskeleton 2- membrane supply to the new processes. Our research aims to understand the molecular events that coordinate these two phenomena. In particular, we investigate the role of the cytoskeletal element called microtubules in the morphological  changes of a neuron. Our reseach should lead to a better comprehension of the molecular mechanisms underlying memory, learning and adaptation.

"Hydropower companies throughout the world increasingly realize that they must deal with issues of climate change. A better knowledge of the nature of climate change impacts will allow water resource managers to make better planning and operation decisions.  



The main objective for the research project is to assess the long-term impact of climate change on the variability and availability of water supply for watersheds of primary interest to Manitoba Hydro and Hydro-Qu�bec, two major Canadian hydro-energy producers.  Specific objectives are: to develop future climate scenarios at the watershed scale; to use the climate scenarios to simulate future river flows for watersheds of interest to these agencies; to evaluate the uncertainty of flow estimates; and to assess the climate change impact on hydropower facilities and explore potential adaptation strategies.



In this project, sophisticated statistical techniques and hydrological models will be used along with global and regional climate model output to generate climate scenarios and simulate river flows.  Adaptation strategies will be investigated through numerical modelling experiments to existing/proposed and hypothetical hydropower systems.



The project will allow the consolidation and development of expertise at Hydro-Qu�bec and at Manitoba Hydro in the area of climate change impact on water resources. Tools and techniques developed in this project are expected to be advantageously transferred to Canadian hydropower companies, water resources agencies and engineering firms concerned with climate change.

"Humans are born with two sets of mental tools for reasoning numerically. One mental tool captures number by creating mental tallies in working memory.  The other works like a noisy ""mental ruler for numbers."" For example, if it represents a set of 4 with a ""mental magnitude"" of size x, it will represent a set of 8 with a mental magnitude of size 2x. While they can be used to reason numerically, the representations created by these systems are cumbersome. For example, representations of the number of stars in the Milky way created with mental tallies or mental magnitudes would be so large that it would be impossible to manipulate them in short-term memory.



Humans overcame the limits of the infant systems by creating systems of arbitrary number symbols like spoken numerals (""ninety-eight"") and Arabic digits (""98""). Arbitrary symbols increased the power of our numerical reasoning by providing compact representations of arbitrarily large numbers. However, even after they master systems of arbitrary symbols, human adults continue to rely on the infant representations to reason numerically. For example, damage to the brain area for the mental ruler greatly impairs the sense of numerical size, even in adults. This suggests that the acquisition of mature numerical representations involves two processes, namely the acquisition of arbitrary number symbols, and the integration of these symbols with infant representations.



My research is dedicated to understanding how these processes unfold in childhood. In particular, I study (1) how children are able to make sense of verbal counting by using the infant representations of number; (2) how deaf children acquire the symbols for numbers in sign language; and (3) when children begin to reason numerically without thinking about particular numbers; i.e. when they begin to reason algebraically.

"This project concerns the simulation and optimization of complex stochastic systems (that involve uncertainty). Stochastic modeling and simulation are primary tools in science, engineering, economics, management, and several other areas. Simulation has become more attractive and less expensive than experimenting with the real systems, due to the decreasing cost of computing and the improvement in simulation methodology and software in the last decades. Simulation is often the only practical tool to deal with realistic models of complex systems, which are typically dynamic, stochastic, and nonlinear. However, designing efficient and reliable simulation methods, and using simulation to optimize decision/operation strategies in these systems, remains very difficult. Random number generators are a fundamental ingredient for stochastic simulation. They are also needed for computer games, gambling machines, and cryptology, for example. Their quality criteria differ across areas of applications, whence the need for different types of designs and for theoretical studies from different viewpoints. Quasi-Monte Carlo methods replace the vectors of random numbers used in a simulation by points that cover the space more uniformly than random points, to improve the accuracy of the simulation results. Other ways of improving efficiency include concentrating the sampling adaptively toward the most important events. My research focuses on the design and analysis of methods for: (1) random number generators for various types of applications, (2) high-dimensional numerical integration via randomized quasi-Monte Carlo, (3) improving the efficiency of simulations (e.g., by designing estimators with smaller variance) and dealing with rare events, (4) optimization of stochastic systems via simulation. These methods are applied in several areas such as finance, risk analysis, telecommunications, management, and so on. Both theoretical aspects (e.g., convergence analysis of algorithms and mathematical analysis of the structure of random number generators) and practical ones (e.g., empirical experimentation, software implementation) are covered.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Advancement of knowledge","Informatique et recherche op�rationnelle","LEcuyer, Pierre","RGPIN ","Modelling and simulation studies","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",2-5

"The current proposal addresses the role of brief initial contact in perceptual organization by touch, a form of human processing never comprehensively addressed by touch scientists before. Perceptual organization is fundamental to the key question for human perception: How do we move from initial incomplete or inaccurate information derived from our sensory receptors to percepts of the world that are most often accurate, unambiguous and apparently complete? Our objectives are: i) to quantitatively assess key principles for tactually grouping and segmenting simultaneous contacts based on how the areas contacted move under the fingers when force is applied (kinetics), as well as on their geometric and/or material contact properties, and ii) to assess their consequences for tactual perception and tactually guided grasping. To initially assess the influence of perceptual organization on tactual perception and tactually guided grasping, participants will perform a series of brief contacts or ""glances"" using from 2 to 10 fingers to explore tabletop scenes of unfamiliar 3-D objects that vary in their kinetic, geometric, and/or material properties. Relevant perceptual and grasp responses will be required in these simple but ecologically natural experiments. In later expts, we will permit more limited but carefully controlled initial contact with 2-finger custom-designed touch displays. In Perception expts, participants will estimate the probability of perceiving 1 object, as opposed to 2. In the Grasp expts, they will do so indirectly by selecting where to position their thumb to form a stable grasp following earlier brief contact with index and middle fingers. The results will raise important questions about tactual perception and tactually guided grasping, and complement current research on perceptual organization by vision and audition scientists. They will also contribute to the quantitative assessment of extent of impaired tactual perceptual organization in stroke patients. Finally, they will improve the design of: i) telerobotic systems for touch sensing and tactually-guided grasping, ii) tangible graphics (e.g., maps, graphs) for blind users, and iii) virtual touch environments for blind and sighted users.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge",Psychology,"Lederman, Susan","RGPIN ","Sensory systems and perception",Psychology,Psychologie,3-5

"Probiotic and prebiotic products as ""quality of life and managing biological resources"" are on the market in the forms of milk based drinks, yogurts and capsules. Intake of probiotic bacteria is associated with beneficial health benefits to the human and animal hosts, but current understanding of how the bacteria actually illicit these effects is not very good. Although the genetics and molecular tools of more common dairy lactic bacteria like Lactococcus and Lactobacillus exist, knowledge is lacking behind with closely related Bifidobacterium genus, which is phylogenetically and physiologically (bifidus shunt) distinct. After the molecular tools and mechanisms are elucidated, a more rational approach to the therapeutic use of probiotics could be possible. The current focus of my research program is centered on the hypothesis that one can study fundamental scientific knowledge and improve the performance of probiotic strain by genetic manipulation of its expression of certain proteins. As genetic tools become available for bifidobacteria, more work can be done on understanding their physiology and metabolic activities important for survival in food as well as for understanding their beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal system. The short term objectives are to (1) develop food grade cloning and expression systems, (2) construct new over-expression systems for production of a heterologous protein like bile salt hydrolase (BSH) to validate BSH hypothesis for cholesterol lowering effect of Bifidoabcterium lactis strains (BSH mutant, native and over-expressed) in hens and mice models, and 3) demonstrate the hypothesis that one can improve the performance of probiotic strains by cloning the genes of interest in the respective BSH negative mutants. An air and acid tolerant industrial strain, Bifidobacterium lactis clearly identified as probiotic traits that currently used in probiotic yogurts and this presents a challenge as very little genetic expression work has been done. The concept of developing an innovative Bifidobacterium food-grade vector and expression system to advance our understanding of the metabolic activity, gene function, and expression is a novelty that will be useful for researcher and industries to evaluate the probiotic effects.

"Firms selling perishable goods or services face a challenging problem of pricing limited capacity of their goods or services over a finite period. Due to the limited availability of the supplies in terms of time and quantity, customers are often willing to pay premium. This creates the opportunity to sell the product to customers in different situations for different prices. 

   Revenue management can be defined as the scientific approach to making decisions on price and allocation of perishable goods or services with an objective to maximize the total revenue. Revenue management has been a big success in passenger airlines since the 1970's when deregulation of the fares led to high competitions.

   We propose to implement revenue management for the freight transportation industry, which has consistently contributed to around 60 percent of the total logistics cost in the US. Revenue management in freight transportaion is challenging for many reasons: Freight can follow more complex routes; Demand uncertainty is multi-dimensional; Transportation capacity is easy to adjust.

In this research we will tackle both static and dynamic versions of revenue management in freight transportation. The static problem is more toward contract-based business customers, whereas the dynamic problem is for spot-market customers who arrive randomly over time. Decisions to be made include capacity allocation and re-allocation to different types of customers, pricing of services for different types of customers, workload-based adaptive pricing, and optimal overbooking with consideration of surplus capacity allocated to contract-based customers. 

   Mathematical programming-based and dynamic programming approach would be suitable for static and dynamic revenue management, respectively. In both cases, heuristic approaches will be developed to address practically sized problems.

"Genetic information is stored in the form of DNA found in a cell compartment called the nucleus.  This genetic information has to be transported out of the nucleus into the extra-nuclear cytoplasm where gene products or proteins are made.  Messenger ribonucleic acids or mRNAs are the bio-molecules that carry the genetic information from DNA in the nucleus to the cytoplasm.  mRNAs which carry the genetic code for each gene are then used for the synthesis of proteins.  The proteins then carry out most of the important biochemical functions of the cells.  The amount of proteins is directly dependent on the amount of mRNAs.  Excessive or insufficient amounts of certain proteins due to changes in mRNA levels can lead to diseases.  The amount of mRNA is in large part determined by the rate of its degradation.  An understanding of how mRNA is degraded is therefore important for generating basic knowledge of how mRNA degradation machinery works, as well as for revealing information on the pathogenesis of some diseases.  It is widely believed that mRNAs from eukaryotes, including mammals, are degraded primarily from ends of the molecule.  mRNA is also known to be degraded via cleavage in the middle of the molecule - a process known as endonucleolytic cleavage.  However, little is known about the enzymes (endonucleases) that cleave mammalian mRNAs endonucleolytically and what role they play in controlling mRNA abundance in cells.  Our laboratory has recently purified, characterized, and identified at least two mammalian endonucleases, syntaxin18 and RNase1, that can cleave c-myc mRNA in test tubes.  Syntaxin18 is involved in the mechanism of protein movement in cells but it has not been previously described as an endonuclease.  The major goal of our research is to determine whether syntaxin18 and RNase1 can control mRNA abundance in cells.  This will help us in understanding the significance of endonucleolytic cleavage in controlling mRNA abundance.  In addition, such knowledge has the potential in leading to the use of these enzymes or their properties in applied research.

"The governments of Canada and Ontario announced the Windsor Gateway Action Plan in the year 2002 which aims at improving traffic flow at the border crossings between Windsor and Detroit. The plan includes improved border processing, advanced traffic management, and widening of existing roads or construction of new roads. Although the plan suggests important guidelines for future improvement, more detailed assessment of existing traffic conditions and more theoretical and experimental analyses need to be performed to improve congestion and safety on this corridor near the border crossing. In this regard, the study of traffic phenomena under different patterns of traffic flow interruptions and interactions between car and truck movements can help suggest more specific solutions for cross-border traffic on urban streets. 



The study will develop analytical methods to identify the factors associated with traffic delay and accident risk on urban streets with interrupted traffic flow and high truck volume. The study will also provide insight into how to improve traffic flow and reduce vehicle conflicts through intelligent traffic management. Given that traffic delay at the border crossing causes a significant loss to economy and environment in Canada, the study can potentially have a broad impact on promoting international trade between Canada and U.S. and the productivity of Canada's export industry by reducing delayed shipments while also reducing negative impacts on air quality and health.

"One hundred years have elapsed since the term 'heterosis' was coined to describe the phenomenon of the superiority of the F1 over the parental genotypes. After more than 60 years of inbred/hybrid breeding resulting in a 7-fold increase in hybrid grain yield, a 2- to 3-fold difference in grain yield between hybrids and inbreds still exists and the magnitude of heterosis remains unchanged. Heterosis fundamentally changes many aspects of the biology of the maize plant, including at the transcriptional level as expression array results have demonstrated differential expression of genes due to both cis- and trans- effects in hybrids as compared to their inbred parents. In this proposal my research group will be exploiting the phenomena of heterosis to identify a set of candidate genes and processes (i.e., regulatory networks) involved in determining potential kernel number in maize. Kernel number is maize is directly proportional to grain yield and this developmental process is referred to as 'sink establishment'. In addition we will be examining several paradigms that involve or influence sink establish: yield stability, G�E, leaf number, and flowering time.



This research will lead to a greater fundamental understanding of one of the major regulatory networks governing ecological adaptation - seed number.  It will be the basis for training four HQPs in a highly sought after field - plant breeding.  And finally it will enhance our understanding of several developmental paradigms and what has proven to be a highly recalcitrant phenomena - heterosis.

"Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter that is involved in various neurological systems that affect movement, reward, learning and memory.   Release of DA from the presynaptic neuron can bind to postsynaptic receptors to facilitate neurotransmission. To ""turn off"" the DA signal requires clearance of DA from the synapse, which is largely mediated by dopamine transporter (DAT), thus implicating the importance of understanding how the DAT works.  Improper DAT function can lead to states of hyper- or hypo-dopaminergic activity, which has been associated with various brain disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, drug addiction, Parkinson's disease).  DAT-mediated re-uptake of synaptically released DA is largely dependent on DAT cell surface localization.  This proposal will examine the relationship between dynamic neuronal structural proteins and the DAT.  Protein-protein interactions between DAT and cytoskeletal proteins may facilitate DAT localization to specific subcellular areas or cell surface domains.  We will specifically focus on the interaction between DAT and tubulin, which are proteins involved in forming microtubules within cells.  In addition to a previous report showing an association between DAT and tubulin, we have preliminary evidence to suggest a direct interaction between the DAT and tubulin.  Therefore, to investigate the interaction between DAT and tubulin this proposal will pursue the following objectives: (1) characterize the interaction between DAT and tubulin; (2) identify the functional effects of the DAT-tubulin interaction; (3) examine the behavioural effects of disrupting the DAT-tubulin interaction.  This proposal will comprehensively define and identify the physiological significance of the interaction between DAT and microtubule proteins.  These studies may reveal a general mechanism for the regulation of biogenic amine transporters by cytoskeletal proteins.  In addition, understanding how the DAT is regulated by tubulin may provide insight into the molecular mechanism of dopaminergic hyperactivity/hypoactivity implicated in various brain disorders.

"The cell division process is tightly regulated and closely coordinated with copying of its genetic material (DNA). Derangement of this process can be fatal or result in genetic instability. Protein kinase known as Cdc7 plays a critical role in this regulation by connecting the cell cycle engine (i.e., cyclin-dependent kinase) and the replication machinery (i.e., the enzymes copying DNA). To perform its function, Cdc7 must enter the nucleus and then bind to chromatin (i.e., DNA) where DNA replication starts. By mutation analysis, we previously found that the amino acid segment 203-370 contains the signal for the Cdc7 nuclear import. We also found that the segment 306-326 contained a signal for the Cdc7 nuclear retention, probably by binding to chromatin where new DNA synthesis begins. This nuclear retention signal is apparently antagonized by two small segments at the carboxyl terminus of Cdc7 protein, which we collectively term a nuclear export sequence. At present, we do not know: (a) if the signals for the nuclear import and retention are one integrated or two separate elements; (b) how the 21-amino acid segment (306-326) of the nuclear retention sequence regulates the interaction of Cdc7 with DNA (by which DNA synthesis may be activated or inactivated); and (c) how the amino acid modifications of Cdc7 is involved in the regulation of Cdc7 interactions with chromatin. We here propose to carry out an in-depth study of Cdc7 protein domains and critical amino acid residues within each domain. Data from this work will shed important new light on the regulation of DNA replication, and will help to unravelling the regulation mechanism as to how a cell maintains genetic stability.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Medicine, faculty of (East Campus)","Lee, Hoyun","RGPIN ","Intra-cellular targeting","Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",2-5

"The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum is an important and widely distributed pathogen causing the enteric illness cryptosporidiosis.  When infective C. parvum oocysts are swallowed, they excyst into sporozoites which become attached to intestinal epithelial cells.  Here, the parasites multiply by various sexual and asexual stages, and oocysts are formed and passed with feces.  Cryptosporidiosis is an acute but self-limiting illness in immuno-competent patients who typically present with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and fever.  Immuno-compromised persons experience a more severe and chronic infection, which may lead to death.  There is currently no known protective vaccine or treatment for cryptosporidiosis.  Water is a common vehicle for transmission of Cryptosporidium spp.  Routes of transmission for human cryptosporidiosis include zoonotic, environmental and person-to-person contact via the fecal-oral route.  For the water industry, low-level contamination should at least indicate the need for caution and enhanced control measures.  Assessing the threat of waterborne Cryptosporidium is complicated by the dynamic life cycle of the parasite itself.  Even if oocysts are found in drinking water, it is difficult to determine their source, viability and infectivity towards humans. To implement an action level for Cryptosporidium, sensitive methods for detection and quantitation of infective oocysts in drinking water must be researched and brought into common use.  The long term objective of our Cryptosporidium research program is to develop improved methods for the effective detection of Cryptosporidium.  In the short term (5-year funding period of this grant), we plan to focus on the development, assessment and improvement of recombinant antibodies (rAbs) for detecting the presence as well as the viability and infectivity of Cryptosporidium oocysts.  We will do this by selecting for, and improving the binding properties of, rAbs against several oocyst and sporozoite surface proteins.  We will then test the ability of the rAbs to detect the presence of infective and viable C. parvum oocysts in water samples.  Effective and early detection of C. parvum can ultimately lead to the safeguarding of drinking water supplies.

"Nanopore analysis enables the investigation of single molecular events. A single pore (either of bacterial origin or solid state) is inserted in a membrane and isolated between two chambers. When a voltage is applied a constant current will flow through the pore. If a molecule bumps into the pore or translocates through the pore a blockade current (I) will be observed for a particular time (T). Structural and sequence information is embedded in the parameters I and T. More recently, some preliminary investigations of the translocation of peptides (alpha-helices) and proteins (HPr, 86 amino acids) have been completed in Saskatoon. Here I propose to extend these studies to investigate:

1. Peptides. [a] Bent alpha-helix. [b] Helix-turn-helix with disulphide linker. [c] Antiparallel �-sheet. [d] Insulin, before and after reduction of the disulphide bonds. [e] Zn-finger peptide with and without Zn ions (34 residues). These studies will provide a more complete understanding of the relationship between translocation parameters and peptide structure.

2. Proteins. [a] Further mutants of HPr. [b] Ubiquitin (76 amino acids). [c] Lysozyme and RNase A before and after reduction (about 120 amino acids with multiple disulphide bonds). [d] Calmodulin before and after treatment with Ca ions. [e] Solid state pores. They are being fabricated in the Department of Engineering and will allow larger proteins to translocate without unfolding. These studies will provide a basic understanding of which types of proteins might be studied by this technology and what structural information might be elucidated.

3. Protein/protein interactions. 

    )	As a model system, the interaction between HPr (and its mutants) and three monoclonal antibodies will be studied. It is predicted that very weak interactions between proteins which are difficult to analyze by other techniques will cause significant changes to the translocation parameters.

"The proposed research program is a continuation of the research that I have been carrying out under NSERC support since 1965. My interest is primarily concerned with the investigation of the detonation, shock waves and explosion phenomenon. The ultimate goal is to achieve a quantitative description of the complex propagation mechanisms of high speed combustion waves and the non steady propagation of shock waves from chemical explosions. The key problems in detonation research is the understanding of the unstable cellular detonation structure. Once a knowledge of the structure is achieved, empirical correlations and analytical theories can be developed to predict the other dynamic detonation parameters of practical interest (e.g. dependence of velocity on the boundary conditions, detonation limits, critical energy for direct initiation, failure diameter, conditions required for the transition from deflagration to detonation, etc.). Quantitative knowledge of the detonation phenomenon is essential for realistic risk assessment of hazardous facilities, and to the prevention, suppression, and mitigation of accidental explosions in the chemical industries, nuclear reactors, energy transportation and storage facilities. Explosion research also addresses the defense needs of Canada. The investigation of the fundamental mechanisms of detonative combustion also contributes to the understanding and modeling of high speed turbulent reacting flows, an area of fluid mechanics which is currently not well understood.

"Actin fibers hold normal cells together in much the same way that wooden joists and beams hold a residential house together. When cells grow and move, they must quickly change their actin structures, a process aptly described as remodeling. We are studying two proteins that control this remodeling, cyclin B1 and Filamin A (FLNa). Cyclin B1 controls cell division. FLNa is important to a cell because it controls the assembly of actin fibers. Using the house construction analogy, FLNa proteins are the cellular nails and screws that attach actin fibers to each other and other parts of the cells.  We believe that cyclin B1 and FLNa co-operate to control actin structures and are thus likely to have important roles in controlling cell shape and rigidity. Understanding the molecular mechanism by which cyclin B1 and FLNA control of actin structures is the overall goal of this grant. We believe that understanding this process will aid in our ability to characterize and ultimately engineer cellular mechanical structures.

"In today's dynamic market and complex manufacturing environment for chemical process industries, operating conditions of all units of a plant must be carefully coordinated in order to remain near an economic optimum. Real time optimization (RTO) solves the problem of coordinating various plant units and has attracted the attention of process industry. The conventional RTO system is based on a steady-state flow-sheet model of a plant, and its formulation can be extremely limited for most integrated plants with their units interacting across different time scales. Other approaches utilizing dynamical behaviour of an entire plant are unlikely to scale to real plant-wide problems in any foreseeable future because of exorbitant computational requirements. Contrary to the paucity of scalable plant-wide dynamics and dynamic optimization scheme for practical systems, the rapid growth of distributed control systems and data acquisition tools has resulted in the availability of massive and high dimensional data. Such data capture the history of various operation modes and events. The objective of my research is to develop fundamental theories and computational frameworks for deriving an improved plant-wide operation strategy by extracting valuable information from historical plant operation data without constructing a plant-wide dynamic model. It would be expected that applications of the suggested framework to the decision hierarchy in process industry will result in significantly improved process and economic performance.

"Penetrant transport in glassy polymers has played a major role in traditional engineering applications such as membranes, packaging and barrier materials. More recently, this phenomenon has become increasingly important in applications ranging from micro and nanofabrication to the design of swelling-controlled hydrogels for drug delivery. In the latter case, the presence of a substantial volume swelling and the diffusion of entrapped solute may further complicate the overall rate process. Such swelling and diffusion generally do not follow a Fickian diffusion mechanism. Although the case of a single penetrant transport in glassy polymers has been studied extensively, the effect of initial solute concentration level in the polymer on the solvent penetration characteristics has not been properly studied, and the role of the swelling process in relation to the observed solute release behaviour from glassy polymers, in particular hydrogels, has not been conclusively resolved. 



The long-term objective of the proposed research is to fully elucidate the mechanisms of solute and solvent transport in glassy polymers. Our immediate objective is aimed at elucidating the effect of sample size and geometry as well as initial solute concentration on anomalous penetrant transport, and gaining an in-depth understanding of the kinetics of solute diffusion from glassy polymers undergoing extensive solvent swelling.

 

The results from the proposed research will bring new insights into the generally overlooked effect of local solute concentration on the characteristics of penetrant transport, and provide conclusive resolution regarding the effect of solvent swelling on the kinetics of solute release from glassy polymers. Information gained will be of critical importance to the design and selection of glassy polymers for applications ranging from micro and nanofabrication to drug delivery.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","Pharmacy, Leslie Dan Faculty of","Lee, Ping","RGPIN ","Biomedical materials","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",3-4

"In recent years, nanosatellites have increasingly been recognized as valuable tools for demonstrating new technologies in space as well as being an effective means to educate space engineering professionals due to their relatively low cost. This recognition has come alongside new advances in miniaturized technologies that have boosted the capabilities of nanosatellites.



Capitalizing on these trends and on our research strengths in atmospheric science at York University, we have initiated the York University Space Engineering Nanosatellite Demonstration (YuSEND) program. We have focused on the development of enabling nanosatellite technologies that will allow important missions to measure niche changes in earth's atmosphere. At the same time, more students will gain the irreplaceable experience of working on a space mission with tangible deliverables.



This proposal aims to establish the space environmental testing facility wihtin the YuSEND program. The equipment will allow us to build sufficient capability to  develop missions to support Earth observation, in particular, the pollution monitoring. 



We believe that nanosatellites will provide cost-effective yet efficient ways to perform Atmospheric and space science to provide global coverage. In order to provide meaningful science from such small platform, we need significant effort in developing space technologies. This proposal will support the engineering research to build the groundwork for future science.

"Nanosatellites, a class of satellites with mass less than10 kg, have become extremely popular as a means to educate and demonstrate new technologies in space. Recently, advancement in Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) has enabled the nanosatellite community to broaden its research to space science and Earth observing missions. To support future missions that require higher degree of control, we propose to develop a suite of low-cost, high-performance attitude-control components for the next generation of nanosatellites.

          The research focuses on the advanced algorithm in attitude sensor and actuator design. We are investigating ways to improve the performance of a star tracker by improving the sub-pixel interpolation technique. By implementing an adaptive Kalman Filter with a compensation algorithm, we are also seeking an alternative method to determine the spacecraft attitude using low-cost sensors. We plan to design a low-cost actuator suite that will control nano-spacecraft to an arc-minute level accuracy. The proposed method focuses on the modeling and simulation required to achieve the most cost-effective methods. We will also study a robust-control method that will compensate for unforeseen events such as an actuator failure or misalignments. With the proposed design and advanced algorithm, we are confident we can achieve (1) better than 10 arc-minute accuracy, (2) 1 arc-minute knowledge accuracy, (3) a robust control method and (4) an adaptive determination algorithm. To combine the above components and algorithms together we propose to develop a semi-autonomous control strategy. We are investigating a new approach to monitor the health of the components and make intelligent decisions about them. 

Recently, the National Science Foundation announced a long-term program to support nanosatellite missions for space and atmospheric research, which will require much better accuracy than conventional educational nanosatellites.  The proposed research will allow us to develop uniquely Canadian technology to enable nanosatellite missions and pursue a niche global market for enabling technologies that are much in demand.

"Over the past several decades my laboratory has studied the evolution of genomes in green algae, the group from which land plants arose. The main focus of our work is on organelle genomes, i.e., those in mitochondria and chloroplasts, the sites of respiration and photosynthesis, respectively; the presence of genomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts is normally essential to the functioning of these organelles. The overriding theme of our efforts has been to document and explain the diversity of organelle genome features, like intact vs. fragmented; circular vs. linear, GC-rich vs. AT-rich, and compact vs. bloated (i.e., high vs. low fraction of the genome has a coding function). The proposed work for the next grant period focuses on three main activities: (1) testing the mutational-burden hypothesis as an explanation for the compactness variation in mitochondrial, chloroplast and nuclear genomes in selected unicellular green algal species; 

(2) confirming and explaining the origin of mitochondrial genetic disease in the Oogamochlamys-clade of green algae; and (3) testing the hypothesis that the degenerate chloroplast in the green alga Polytomella parva, which contains no chlorophyll and no longer performs photosynthesis, has lost its genome and gene expression system. In recent years there has been an increased interest in green algae as a possible source of renewable energy, so basic knowledge about these organisms, especially when it concerns their mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, could be valuable in unexpected ways. Finally, the association of deleterious changes in mitochondrial DNA with aging and certain genetic diseases in humans is now well established but the cause or causes for these mutations is less clear. Studying genetic dysfunction in green algal mitochondria is technically much easier than in humans and other mammals and may yield knowledge of value to the animal studies.

"Having successfully built up a major simulation and construction research institute over the past ten years, the Industrial Research Chair program in Construction Engineering and Management at the University of Alberta (""the IRC"") has identified a set of key objectives for the next decade of research development and expansion. We intend to strengthen and expand our collaborations and sustaining relationships with top-level researchers and industry at the global level. The proposed International Innovation Workshop seeks to bring together top-level researchers in simulation technology, many of whom are leaders of successful research programs and research centres with a vision founded on simulation. This event will be launched alongside the annual Canadian Construction Research Forum in August 2009, at Banff, Alberta, in order to entice that conference's audience of industrial practitioners and end-users of the IRC's simulation technologies and decision-support tools. The Workshop will focus on simulation research with partners in government and industry, inviting many of the leading figures from a major conference on construction research funding at the University of Illinois and connecting them to the industrial leaders participating in the Forum. This Workshop has a number of targeted and tangible objectives, including: (1) To study successful partnerships between academia, the construction industry, and the public sector at different institutions around the world, in order to identify the critical success factors in the creation of these partnerships; (2) To identify research and educational trends worldwide to enhance international scholarly collaboration; (3) To define an action plan in order to promote the creation of new partnerships in this area in Canada and international partner institutions; and (4) To consolidate long-term research and education initiatives with international partner institutions and the construction industry. The outcomes of this workshop will foster collaboration among international institutions and the construction industry and it will assist in the identification of new research areas that are needed to sustain economic growth of nations as well as the competitiveness of the construction industry in a global economy.

"The proposed research will develop a hybrid System Dynamics and Discrete Event Simulation system in order to understand and manage complex and dynamic large-scale construction projects. Considering the persistent cost and schedule overruns present in construction, there is a tremendous need to provide an effective tool to facilitate a better understanding of large-scale construction. In essence, the PI seeks to identify complex interactions among various processes in large-scale construction, particularly through feedbacks (i.e., interactions) between construction operations and their surrounding contexts given that these feedbacks result in the severe dynamics and complexities present in large-scale construction. A hybrid System Dynamics and Discrete Event Simulation approach is pursued in order to effectively model and analyze these feedbacks, utilizing System Dynamics and Discrete Event Simulation to their fullest potential. In other words, maintaining Discrete Event Simulation's excellent capability to analyze discrete operations, the PI integrates System Dynamics in order to utilize its strength in representing the feedbacks between operation and context. 

The realization of this research will contribute to: (1) identifying context, a complement to operations, as a new management dimension; (2) capturing inside mechanisms (i.e., feedbacks) between operation and context, thereby developing a better understanding of large-scale construction; (3) improving construction performance (i.e., recommending appropriate control actions by means of the developed hybrid simulation models); and (4) establishing a stepping stone for future simulation research in diverse fields, proposing a channel to overcome the limitations of current simulation approaches.","Construction methods","Construction, urban and rural planning","Civil and Environmental Engineering","Lee, SangHyun","RGPIN ","Construction engineering and management","Civil engineering","G�nie civil",2-5

"It is difficult to understand correlated many-body systems from a first principle calculation due to the huge number of coupled degrees of freedom. However, despite the complexity of the system at the microscopic length scale, the long distance properties can be described by a relatively simple effective theory. Effective theory can serve as a characterization of the many-body state in the sense that different phases are described by different effective theories. Until now, several different phases have been realized in condensed matter systems. They include the Landau Fermi liquid state, the symmetry broken state and the topologically ordered phase of the fractional quantum Hall systems. On the other hand we know that the vacuum of our universe is described by richer effective theories which include gauge theory, general relativity and (possibly) supersymmetry. Therefore one can ask whether these effective theories may also emerge in some condensed matter systems. The objective of this research is to search for new states of condensed matter systems whose long distance properties are characterized by gauge theory, general relativity or supersymmetry.","Physical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Physics and Astronomy","Lee, SungSik","RGPIN ","Condensed matterphysics","Condensed matterphysics","Physique de la mati�re condens�e",3-5

"In the past, CD8+ T cells (T8 cells) have been thought to exhibit relatively limited function, primarily restricted to cytotoxic activity. Recently, a broader spectrum of T8 cell activity has been elucidated. As research has accumulated regarding the increasing spectrum of T8 cell activity, there has been a consequent interest in the manner of their activation, proliferation, differentiation, phenotype expression and memory cell development. Although it is now generally accepted that T8 cells can be activated independently of CD4+ T cells (T4 cells) under certain conditions, there remains considerable controversy over the type and level of this activation. Most studies have examined CTL activity in isolation, leaving undetermined the broader spectrum of T8 effector function. The studies to date are in general agreement that T8 CTL activation can occur in the absence of T4 help but that these ""helpless"" T8 cells cannot progress to long term memory cells. This paradigm has been recently challenged in a transplant model that provided evidence that T4 help was not required for T8 activation, effector function or memory. The transplant model represents: (i) a substantial antigenic challenge, (ii) extremely high responder cell precursor frequency and (iii) substantial inflammation at the outset.  In our experimental program we address a number of fundamental questions regarding T8 cell activation and effector functions using our transplant model.  The ablation strategy to produce ""helpless"" T8 cells is the introduction of therapeutic levels of CyA.  We will examine a more complete spectrum of T8 activity, rather than just CTL activity.  Finally, the findings of this experimental program will elucidate fundamental aspects of disparity in the role of calcineurin mediated nuclear binding events between T4 and T8 cell activation, differentiation and development of memory.

"Learning new motor skills is a critical part of our daily lives. We use tools to cook, mend things, and input data into computers; we rent cars or borrow bicycles and maneuver them through unfamiliar environments; we take on jobs that sometimes require a whole new set of physical skills. Sometimes learning occurs quickly and effortlessly. For other skills the learning seems to never end. The research strategy undertaken in our lab has been devoted to discovering how humans acquire, retain, and transfer motor skills. In particular, we are concerned with understanding better ways to structure the learning environment to facilitate this process. We focus our interest on both lab-based tasks and real motor skills and analyze the behaviour of the individual - effectiveness and efficiency of performance in terms of time and error represents the primary variables of interest.



This proposal is divided into three series of research areas. In the first series we investigate the role of practice conditions on learning, and specifically, why practice conditions that are imposed on learners have quite different effects compared to practice that is regulated by the individual. The second series concerns the representation of motor skill in individuals who possess very high levels of expertise - why increased practice leads to both an increased capacity to generalize skilled behavior, yet at the same time, an increased level of specificity of learning. In the third series we investigate coordination, in particular, the tendency to coordinate moving parts according to two fundamental principles. Here, we investigate the application of these principles to the control and learning of a sport task - golf putting.



Two long-term goals for this NSERC programme are: a) to develop and refine theory related to the acquisition, retention and transfer of motor skills, and b) to refine applications of motor skill learning principles that will benefit practitioners who work daily with clients in the learning of motor skills (e.g., instructors, coaches), or in the reacquisition of impaired skills (e.g., therapists). We are confident that the proposed research agenda will continue our efforts and successes to achieve these goals.

"The main objective of in fluid animation in Computer Graphics is to reproduce plausible fluid behaviour. Simulating fluids is a computationally expensive task, and interactive computer applications largely simplify fluid behaviour at the cost of accuracy or limited flexibility; however newer computer applications require both high levels of realism and efficient computations. This motivates the research methods that achieve efficient fluid simulation with high accuracy in real-time. One research direction is the use of statistical analysis techniques for synthesizing fluid motion by forming parameterized database of fluid examples. The input data and parameterized fluid behaviour would then allow efficient generation of realistic fluid flows. The ability to reproduce fluid behaviour efficiently, based on heavy pre-processing step, will lead to the advancement of the field and various surrounding fields. We aim to contribute to the development of these other areas that make use of the simulation of fluids, focusing on two applications; art in virtual reality and medical application among many potential applications such as aeronautical engineering, mechanical engineering, education, and entertainment industry.","Computer software","Information and communication services","Information Technology and Engineering, School of","Lee, WonSook","RGPIN ",Graphics,"Information technology","Technologie de l'information",1-5

"Metallic contaminants such as mercury have catastrophic impacts on environmental integrity and human health. In Canada, hundreds of decommissioned mines and chlor-alkali plants continue to contaminate waterways, contributing to fish consumption advisories where mercury bio-availability exceeds World Health Organization's threshold levels and measurable risk to human health exists. Environmental toxicity ratings from United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recently ranked mercury third after arsenic and lead in their Priority List of Hazardous Substances.   

Bacteria can reduce the risk of mercury and other metals through anaerobic conversion to biologically inactive sulfides, but this fails to offer a practical remedy for point-source contamination typically occurring in aerobic conditions. This proposal is designed to advance an exciting new discovery that some microbes are able to convert mercury ions into sulfides under aerobic conditions. Aerobic bioconversion processes offer many advantages: enhanced conversion rates; potential to sequester a wide range of toxic metals (e.g. Pb, Cd, and Cr); amenability with flow-through bioreactors used to treat industrial and municipal waste effluents; and the ability to boost production of hydrogen gas, a valuable fuel and raw material for fuel cell technology. Consequently, these newly characterized microbes hold immense potential for a dual role in bioremediation and fuel production where metal contamination exists.

This proposal presents a detailed and cohesive research plan with which to clearly understand metal biotransformation into sulfides and associated enhancement of hydrogen gas production.  It concentrates on investigating metabolic processes and their regulation.  The research offers ample opportunity to train highly qualified personnel in physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology with exposure to a breadth of state-of-the art techniques. It also will introduce students to basic research areas that interact with the important industrial activities of bioremediation and fuel biosynthesis.

"In this research proposal we consider some aspects of the marginal likelihood as a criterion for Bayesian model selection. The marginal likelihood is defined as the marginal density of the data under a given model, and can be interpreted as a measure of how the data supports the model. The higher this value, the more likely is the model under consideration. Hence, a general rule is to select the model yielding the maximal marginal likelihood value. When we wish to compare two models, the decision can be based on the value of the Bayes factor, which is defined as the ratio of the respective marginal likelihoods.



We first want to investigate how to fine-tune some sequential Monte Carlo samplers (SMCS). SMCS are a new class of samplers that can be used for marginal likelihood estimation. We suggest the use of two statistical distances to select sequences of related statistical distributions required for their implementation. Secondly, we will consider possible alternate specifications of the fractional Bayes factor. The fractional Bayes factor is a robust modification of the Bayes factor that is used in the presence of weak prior information on the parameters of the models. We will consider the application of the suggested theoretical developments on Bayesian graphical models applied to biological problems. Finally we will take a new approach on model selection for Marginal Structural Models and consider model averaging. Model averaging consists in taking the weighted mean of a quantity of interest over the models, where the weights are proportional to the marginal likelihood (under the assumption that the models are a priori likely). This should bring an improvement over the usual approach where only one single model is selected for inference.

"Some animals will often try new foods or new feeding techniques in the wild, while others are much more conservative. We call this innovativeness. Crows, hawks, falcons and gulls are much more innovative than are grouse, ducks or doves; chimpanzees and capuchins are much more innovative than are marmosets. What are the advantages and disadvantages of being more or less innovative? Innovators tend to have large brains, corrected for body size. Innovative birds tend to remain in the same areas in winter instead of migrating. The groups that they belong to tend to have more species and subspecies and to be better colonizers when introduced to new countries, as the house sparrow and the starling were to North America. 

During the next 5 years, we want to understand how exactly an innovative bird like a grackle solves an innovative food-finding problem and whether being in a social group helps. We also want to see how being more or less innovative relates to how good you are at reproducing, avoiding parasites, living longer and being in better body condition. Finally, we want to see if birds choose mates that are more innovative and whether they prefer those that know the same new feeding technique that they do. If this is so, then a key condition for faster speciation (the proceess that leads to more species and subspecies) is met: animal populations can diverge on the basis of mating preferences for innovative behaviours.

"Mathematics, especially arithmetic, is a skill that everyone uses on a daily basis.  Shopping, banking, home renovations, and even following a favorite sports team necessitate the activation and manipulation of quantities and numbers.  Informed citizens experience a daily barrage of quantitative data through TV, magazines, and newspapers.  Thus, understanding the representations and processes that people use to accomplish mathematical tasks has obvious practical importance.  Theoretically, mathematics is a tractable domain in which to test theories about how, for example, thinkers are able to manage multiple mental tasks.  My ongoing research program addresses questions about how people store and access their mathematical knowledge.  The present proposal is focused on how we use limited mental resources to manage complex mathematical activities.  Consider the following:  You need to estimate the square footage of a room that measures 13 x 8.5 m.  You have several options.  You could use the solution algorithm taught in school.  You could use a calculator.  You might visualize the numbers and mentally calculate.  Or, you could estimate by rounding 8.5 to 10 and responding with an approximate answer, ""about 130 square m"".  Which solution approach you choose will depend on the situation, on your mathematical competencies, and on the precision required for the answer.  In my research, we combine arithmetical tasks with other tasks known to require specific mental resources to determine how people solve mathematical problems.  For example, participants might be asked to remember visual or verbal information while solving the above problem and then we test how their mental processes are affected by the specific memory demands.  I am particularly interested in individual differences in mathematics. What cognitive abilities or skills contribute to mathematical skill?  In summary, over the last 20 years, my research on mathematical cognition has provided insights into the flexibility and diversity of mental processes that adults use to solve math problems.  These insights and the further research described in this proposal will allow advances in our understanding of how people solve mathematical problems.

"This grant is for the multiplication, field screening, development, and initial breeding of an oilseed field pea for use in the biodiesel market. Through our preliminary screening of 6 accessions, we have found an average of 12% lipid content within field peas which is significantly larger than the industry accepted values of <2%. This largely unknown lipid content in field pea will allow pea to compete with both canola (> 35% oil) and soybean (> 20% oil).  Over the last few years it has become obvious that large quantities of agricultural products will be used to meet society's energy needs.  This demand places increased stress on Canada's agricultural sector to supply both food and energy.  The development of an oilseed pea provides a new means to produce lipids that will strongly benefit Canada while both increasing the number of crops available for the Canadian farmer, and reducing crop inputs through reduced requirement for nitrogen fertilization.  Pea has never been used by the public as an oil source and has potentially less conflict between food versus fuel markets than traditional oilseed crops.  The development of an oilseed pea has added environmental and economic benefits over canola and/or soybean, such as the ability to fix nitrogen, grow in Canada's cooler climate, and have both high edible protein and oil content.  Field pea is already grown throughout western Canada which decreases the challenges of market penetration and acceptance by the farming community.  This grant's overall goal is for pea accession seed multiplication, screening for lipid content, breeding, and implementing the oilseed pea project to develop a novel new oilseed crop for Canada.

"My research program in photonics focus on two aspects: (1) molecular imaging with intense ultrafast laser and (2) nonlinear optics in biology towards biomedical imaging applications.



(1) Molecular imaging with intense ultrafast laser:  During chemical reaction, bonds are broken and new ones are formed.  For certain reactions, for example proton transfer, the molecular dynamics occurs on a femtosecond time scale (1 femtosecond = 1�10-15 second).  Imaging in real-time the molecular structures during ultrafast chemical processes is a major challenge and new approaches are required.  Currently, around the world, scientists are developing new imaging methods and my research program will contributed to this effort by using the unique temporal resolution of sub-10 femtoseconds laser pulses.  My research will focus on Coulomb explosion imaging and will be performed using advanced technologies available at Advanced Laser Light Source laboratory (ALLS, INRS-EMT).



(2) Nonlinear optics in biology towards applications for biomedical imaging:  During the last decade, femtosecond laser technology has impacted significantly biomedical imaging.  In particular, the combination of nonlinear optical effects with microscopy has demonstrated great impact in biomedecine allowing thick tissue imaging with sub-micron resolution.  At INRS-EMT, using the background acquired during my postdoc at Harvard University, I'm currently initiating a unique research program that will focus on the application of multiphoton microscopy for tissue imaging.  I am particularly interested by SHG, THG and CARS microscopy as these processes are coherent.  My research program will focus on understanding the effect of this coherence when biological tissues are imaged with the objective of using this coherence to gain information about the nanoscale architecture of biological materials.

"The goal of the proposed research is to develop simple and efficient asymmetric methodologies of broad use that will serve as tools to facilitate the work of synthetic chemists in both academia and industry. Achieving this feat is a continuing challenge since both reactivity and stereoselectivity must be optimized concurrently. This work is of the utmost importance since chiral molecules can possess useful properties and have numerous applications. For example, a large number of modern drugs are chiral enantiopure compounds. Efficiency and cost are important related aspects of the research process, and it is critical to employ all the tools available to streamline and enhance its productivity. My approach will focus on a strong interaction between experimental and computational studies to achieve progress at lower cost and in reduced time. Molecular modelling is particularly well suited to understand the stereoselectivity and rationalize the design of the chirality-inducing moiety. My first research theme focuses on the synthesis and investigation of catalysts based on a new class of anionic carbene ligands derived from the N-iminoimidazolium ylide motif. These compounds will be obtained through a simple and modular synthetic route, which will rapidly lead to the creation of libraries of complexes that will facilitate the investigation of their potential. This diversity is also crucial to enable the fine tuning of the metal complexes reactivity for specific methodologies. A first generation of chiral catalysts will be synthesized and evaluated in model reactions (e.g. allylic alkylations, 1,4-conjugate additions). My second research theme consists of the development of novel chiral iodine(III) reagents that will be used in enantioselective iodine(III) mediated reactions, such as the alpha-tosyloxylation of ketones and ditosyloxylation of styrene. My last theme targets the study of Lewis base-mediated enantioselective iodocyclization reactions. Computational chemistry will be used to understand the mechanism of these reactions, and help design new chiral bases.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Chimie,"Legault, Claude","RGPIN ","Synthetic methodology","Organic chemistry","Chimie organique",1-5

"    )	Variation partitioning, combined with multi-scale PCNM analysis, allows researchers to differentiate the resuls of the complementary processes of environmental control (niche-based) and community dynamics (neutral processes). My long-term research objective is to test hypotheses about these processes in ecosystems. This is of great importance because quantitative changes in beta diversity, or changes in its spatial organization, indicate natural or anthropogenic changes in ecosystems. During my career, I learned to combine community ecology and statistics, creating new numerical methods that proved to be of prime importance for the progress of community ecology. The new avenues that I will explore during the next 5-year cycle are described in the Proposal. That work can only be done by teams of statistically-inclined scientists who understand the primary ecological questions and are able to relate to researchers in statistics and computer sciences.

    )	Fundamental ecology: we will analyze ecosystems for the relative importance of broad-scale physical processes versus local environmental conditions. At finer scales, we will assess the relative importance of neutral versus niche-based processes. PCNM analysis will be applied to multivariate ecological time series. It will also be extended to test the importance of historical events in shaping present-day communities, providing clues about the effect of ongoing anthropogenic changes on communities. Fourth-corner analysis will be generalized to make its results richer in ecological information. Fourth-corner analysis will be incorporated into a new form of variation partitioning for the study of partial relationships between species traits and environmental characteristics while controlling for the effect of well-understood environmental variables. Methodological developments: we will develop new statistics for model selection in the study of multivariate regression trees (MRT). We will also develop a new test for the space-time interaction in multi-species surveys without replication.  We will extend our single-beam sonar methodology for seafloor mapping and our SonarX R-language library to multi-beam sonars, which provide more information-rich sonar returns.

Also, these surface proteins (also called receptors) are involved in virus uptake into cells. One way to regulate cell surface expression of these receptors is endocytosis. Endocytosis is a complex process that allow receptors to enter inside the cell. Mechanism of endocytosis involved a variety of protein complexes that play a role at different step and time. One of the challenge of cell biology is to understand the function of each protein involved in this process and also to identify new proteins. My research program centers on the understanding of the function of two proteins  important in the mechanism of endocytosis.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Sciences fondamentales","LegendreGuillemin, Val�rie","RGPIN ","Cell biology","Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",3-5

"Existing concrete hydraulic structures are showing sign of degradation (cracking) and must maintain stability in case of impacting ice floes and earthquakes. New effective assessment/rehabilitation strategies will permit substantial saving on costly remedial work. Three specific projects addressing particular aspects of the research theme are presented in this proposal:

Project 1 -3D Stability Evaluation and Rehabilitation of Cracked Gravity Dams and Spillway Piers:  A novel robust and computationally efficient 3D coupled nonlinear hydro-mechanical model will be developed. A particular attention will be given to the following aspects that have not been extensively studied in the past, (i) 3D cracking along multiple planes, (ii)  response of chute and piers and stability of cracked components in the presence of uplift pressures and limited, old steel reinforcement, (iii) application steel jacketing to reinforce weak spillway piers.   

Project 2 -Strengthening of Cracked Dam by Cement Grouting: Grouting is used to restore watertigthness in cracked dams. However, the post-grouted stress state and the gain in shear strength are very difficult to quantify.  Laboratory tests on cracked concrete blocks with and without grouting will be performed. Computer models will be developed to study the effect of water level and temperature at the time of grouting, and for subsequent behaviour of the repaired dam under normal and extreme loads (flood earthquake). 

Project 3 - Stability Evaluation of Concrete Dams in Post-Earthquake Damaged Condition- Drainage and Uplift Pressures (UP): Under large earthquake tensile cracking and sliding displacement are likely to take place. New seepage path will emerge and the drainage system will be disrupted. Dynamic opening-closing-sliding tests will be done on cracked concrete blocks with a hole (drain) to quantify seismic damage on seeping paths - water test will be done to measure UP and drain efficiency. Computer model will be developed to extrapolate specimen results to prototype dams. Recommendations will be made to enhance dam safety guidelines.

"Smooth muscle (SM) was described for the first time in the early 1900s, but contrary to striated muscle, the structure and mechanics of SM contractile filaments is still poorly understood. The unique functional properties of SM are incompatible with a fixed array of myosin filaments. Little is known on the assembly of myosin isoforms SM1 and SM2 in vivo. Models have proposed that myosin filaments are labile and can reorganize to generate maximal tension in vivo, but this have never been directly shown. The few studies that did not use stationary images reported changes in the birefringence and X-ray diffraction patterns in SM during contraction. These techniques are, however, not specific for myofilaments. Therefore, it seems that the best way to examine the dynamics of myofilaments is to directly observe them in real-time. 

My long term objective is to understand the dynamics of the filaments of myosin in vivo and their regulatory mechanisms under different mechanical conditions. To progress towards my long term objective, this proposal will answer the following key questions: 1) Are myosin filaments dynamic structures in SM cells? 2) Do myosin isoforms SM1 and SM2 have different dynamics in vivo? 

Methods: We will use two different approaches to analyze fluorescent myosin molecules dynamics in live SM cells. Objective 1: To analyze myofilaments dynamics of purified SM myosin isoforms that have been fluorescently labeled then microinjected in live SM cells. Objective 2: To analyze myofilaments dynamics in SM cell lines expressing GFP-myosin constructs that are subjected to various mechanical conditions.

Significance: It is hard to believe that a century after the first description of SM cells we still do not know if their myosin filaments are a dynamic or a fixed structure. This proposal will allow us to answer this fundamental question. The cell lines developed will also provide an essential tool for further research in the field of SM mechanics. These projects will offer an excellent training opportunity for graduate students in the stimulating environment of the Smooth Muscle Research Group of the University of Calgary.

"One of the principal goals of this research is the development of transition-metal nitrosyl complexes as specific reactants or selective catalysts for organic or organometallic transformations of practical significance.  The other is the development and utilization of the beneficial physiological properties of metal-nitrosyl complexes.  In this connection, we have in recent years focused our attention primarily on nitrosyl complexes of the early transition metals, and during the next grant period we shall undertake the following investigations with these compounds:

     (1) Exploit the unprecedented C-H and C-C bond-activating and bond-forming abilities of some of our complexes to effect new types of organic transformations, particularly those involving the introduction of functional groups onto saturated hydrocarbons and those involving alkene activation and coupling.  These types of transformations are of considerable current interest, primarily due to the potential for the eventual conversion of readily available hydrocarbons into more valuable products.



     (2) Establish the conditions for effecting the metal-mediated migratory insertion of NO into metal-ligand bonds in a predictable manner, and then utilize this type of chemical transformation to synthesize new nitrogen-element bonds of interest to the pharmaceutical industry.



     (3) Determine the preparative methods necessary to synthesize heretofore unkown binary nitrosyl complexes of a range of transition metals.  These complexes are of fundamental importance since they will permit definitive investigations of NO ligand reactivity.  In addition, some of them hold the promise of being developed as specific pharmaceutical agents that can either release or take up NO or function as enzyme inhibitors under physiologically significant conditions.

"Circadian rhythms are daily rhythms such as the sleep-wake cycle that represent a fundamental adaptation to life in a changing twenty-four hour world.  The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN) is the location of a central clock essential for behavioral and physiological rhythms, as well as for the ability of light to synchronize internal rhythms to the outside world. It was commonly believed that the SCN was comprised of a homogenous collection of clock cells; we now know that the SCN is much more complex, being made of not only rhythmic cells, but non-rhythmic ones as well. Our lab recently discovered an additional twist to the organization of the SCN - a small group of cells that appear to be intrinsically rhythmic, are, in fact, driven by the eye.  The eye has been well known to provide light information to the SCN, but its role in controlling rhythms within the central oscillator is new and unexpected. 



Our long-term goal is to understand the functional organization of the central clock, including how oscillators located elsewhere, such as in the eye, interact with the SCN and influence its rhythmic processes.  The current proposal is comprised of two main objectives: the first is to determine the type of signals responsible for communication between the eye and SCN.   The second is to determine which other rhythms expressed by the SCN are dependent on the presence of the eye. These experiments will use anatomical and behavioral techniques, as well as drugs, to dissect apart the brain mechanisms involved.  Since circadian clocks are common to many cell types, understanding communication between the eye and SCN clocks may provide insight into how synchrony is maintained among diverse, independent circadian clocks in many different parts of the body and brain.

"A fundamental issue in ecology and conservation biology is determining how forest edges influence plant and animal communities.  Forest edges are dynamic zones between forested and nonforested environments or between two habitats of contrasting composition or structure. Forests are becoming increasingly fragmented in many parts of the world, which results in edge habitats comprising a proportionally larger part of each fragment.  Edge influences can occur through fragment-level impacts, such as spatial variability in resource abundance, and landscape-level impacts, such as changes in community structure.  For the lemurs of Madagascar, these issues are of particular ecological interest and conservation concern because humans have transformed approximately 90% of the primary forests on the island.  Although conceptual models have been used to investigate animal responses to forest edges, the associated predictions are best applied to taxa that exploit the matrix (e.g., nonforested habitats).  The question arises then as to how models perform for forest-dwelling animals, such as most lemurs, that do not use the matrix.  I propose two new research projects at the fragment and landscape levels in and around Ankarafantsika National Park in northwest Madagascar.  First, my students and I will use observational and experimental studies to test hypotheses on how forest edges influence plant community dynamics, dendrometrics, and abiotic factors.  Second, we will test hypotheses from recent conceptual models on edge influences on lemur abundance (density and biomass) and behavioral ecology (diet, activity, and ranging patterns).  We will focus our lemur studies on two folivores (Lepilemur edwardsi and Avahi occidentalis), two frugivores (Eulemur fulvus and Eulemur mongoz), one folivore/frugivore (Propithecus coquereli), and three omnivores (Microcebus ravelobensis, Microcebus murinus, and Cheirogaleus medius).  The proposed research is of special significance because it tests hypotheses on edge influences at various spatial scales, applies data to serious conservation issues, and supports the training of highly qualified personnel from Canada and Madagascar.

"Neural death in the hippocampus (HPC) is a major factor contributing to memory impairments in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and epilepsy. Yet, the specific contributions of the HPC to memory are not fully understood. Currently, theory and prominent published findings suggest that the hippocampus plays a major, yet temporary, role in the storage of memories. Accordingly, it is proposed that memories become independent of the hippocampus with the passage of time - an entrenched view described in introductory textbooks in psychology as well as advanced textbooks in neuroscience. The current research program will challenge this view and investigate whether an alternative mechanism, reiteration and change in memory strength, can more accurately account for memories becoming independent of the hippocampus. Briefly, reiteration of a memory, in some form, may make a memory stronger within a given neural network and/or make it extend beyond a network required for a less reiterated memory. Thus, stronger and/or wider distribution of the memory may make it less vulnerable to brain damage, including hippocampal damage. Thus, the mechanism underlying HPC-independence may be consolidation over repeated experience rather than consolidation due simply to the passage of time. This research should be of interest to anyone that has considered how memories are formed and stored in the brain and why certain disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's) may cause amnesia for some memories and not others.

"Facilitating the growth of renewable sources of electrical energy will require (i) cost effective extraction of the renewable energy at its source (ii) a strong transmission infrastructure to move energy from the often remote source locations to the load. Power electronics is the technology that enables the economical development of nearly all emerging sources of renewable electrical energy. It is also a key technology for addressing the future transmission needs of Canada.

Power electronics offer unprecedented levels of power flow control, however, at the same time they introduce major challenges. In particular, (i) they offer no ""natural"" regulation of grid voltage and frequency as a conventional generator does, (ii) they are easily destroyed by short duration over-current or over-voltage events, and (iii) they inject harmonics or ""switching noise"" into the grid, disrupting the proper operation of consumer and industrial loads.

The objective of the project is to develop engineering tools for the analysis of networks containing large numbers of converters. The long term goal is to develop a global approach for the control of power networks fed by power electronics; one that is fully scalable, thus facilitating large-scale integration of renewable energy resources. In particular, grid stability problems stemming from dynamic interactions or over-current tripping of power electronic systems will be considered, as well as the power quality problems associated with harmonics and harmonic interactions introduced by power electronics.

"Among the most critical consequences of climate and global change are alterations in the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources. Mitigation and adaptation strategies are needed to prepare both society and the environment for potentially diminishing water supplies, increasingly erratic river flows, or more frequent extreme events such as floods and droughts. These strategies, in turn, require scenarios and modeling approaches which have emerged as key scientific tools to estimate future hydrologic conditions.

The proposed research project will focus on developing an integrated approach to analyze possible impacts of global change (i.e. climate, land use, and socioeconomic change) on a variety of aspects of water resources and hydrology. A state-of-the-art modeling framework will be established at McGill University to simulate present and future hydrological conditions over large regions (including full global coverage). Modeling results are aimed to exceed existing spatial and temporal resolutions, either by applying refined modeling concepts or downscaling techniques. After validating, adapting and enhancing the modeling framework, it will be applied to address key scientific and policy relevant questions such as: How will climate, land use and socioeconomic changes affect regional and global water availability and demand? What is the feedback of these alterations to climate change? Will water stress and scarcity increase in the future? How will the potential to generate hydropower change? Where will the risk of floods and droughts increase? How much water has to be reserved for environmental flow requirements? What critical alterations in the natural hydrological regime will occur? How can we assess the value of environmental services provided by watersheds at large scales?

The results of this interdisciplinary project can provide valuable input (and a framework for comparisons) to promote our understanding of large-scale hydrology and regional water resources. In particular, the findings can be used to inform the development of other models, such as the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis.

"Scientific knowledge has advanced as theoretical predictions are

confronted with unambiguous observational data.  In astronomy and

astrophysics, large-scale computing has become a critically important tool

alongside observations. These simulations allow one to confront theory

with data and both challenge and refine our knowledge of the universe.

This proposal concentrates on two fronts. The first is aimed to study, in

the near term, binary systems involving black hole and neutron stars.

These systems produce gravitational radiation which can be detected  by a

new generation of highly sensitive detectors. Our studies are aimed to

help in the detection and analysis of gravitational waves and thus help

open a new window to our universe. The second front plans to build the

required computational infrastructure to  exploit future petascale

computational facilities to study Gamma Ray Burst  systems in detail. The

ultimate goal is to simulate relevant systems  and obtain theoretical

predictions for both electromagnetic and gravitational waves produced by

them.  This will provide key information to understand one of the most

"The objective of the proposed research program is to investigate the real-time energy optimization control of variable-speed AC drives in motor and generator operations using a virtual model approach. The methodology of the proposed research involves the real-time simulation of electrical machines resulting in an accurate virtual model of the drive which provides speed measurement for sensorless operation, flux and torque measurement for direct torque or field control operation, and losses measurement for energy optimization algorithm. Real-time simulation of AC drives will be investigated and FPGA implementation approach will be considered. To stay accurate, the virtual model must track the operating conditions of the real drive and consequently adjust the parameters. Losses mechanisms in AC drives will be studied and losses models will be developed to include in converter and machine real-time models. Losses model has to take into account both conduction and switching losses in the power converter and saturation, hysteresis, eddy currents and stray losses in the machine. Energy efficiency optimization control schemes based on minimization of the converter switching frequency and on machine flux adaptation will be studied. The virtual model based control method and energy optimization algorithm are first developed and evaluated by simulation. They will be implemented and tested in real-time using a reconfigurable computer that includes both FPGA and DSP for control and virtual model calculations. Validation of the virtual model system will be done by hardware-in-the-loop testing.","Electrical and electronic machinery and equipment (including computer hardware)","Manufacturing processes and products","G�nie �lectrique et g�nie informatique","LeHuy, Hoang","RGPIN ","Power systems","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",3-5

"Mountain ranges like the Canadian Rockies are prominent manifestations of plate tectonic activity and are intimately linked to important reserves of hydrocarbons and precious metals. At a global scale, the processes associated with the uplift of mountains are thought to influence everything from global climate to the chemistry of the world's oceans. Despite their importance, a comprehensive understanding of the nature of mountain belt formation remains elusive. This project will examine sedimentary basins that form within mountain ranges (intermontane basins) in order to understand how the basins and the surrounding mountains evolve over time spans of millions of years. The sediments deposited within intermontane basins provide a unique record of the processes that govern the uplift and evolution of mountains and thus have the potential to elucidate many lesser-known and controversial aspects of mountain range development. This project will determine the history of sedimentation within the basins and the evolution of the surrounding mountains through detailed examinations of the geology, and will utilize both time-tested and novel techniques. The elevation history of mountainous regions (the paleoelevation history) will be reconstructed using a recently developed method, which exploits natural variations in the abundance of isotopes within minerals that precipitate in sedimentary rocks. By integrating the history of sediment deposition and crustal deformation with the paleoelevation record of these basins, this research will provide important new insights into how mountain ranges form, grow and evolve. This information can then be used to test plate tectonic hypotheses, examine the connections between climate and mountain belts, and explore the relationships between mountain range development and the genesis of hydrocarbon- and precious metal-bearing rocks in Canada.

"The program involves the study of the chemistry of short-lived molecules which are involved as intermediates in the reactions of silicon-, germanium-, and tin-containing molecules.  These ""reactive intermediates"" typically exist for only a small fraction of a second, but it is their chemistry that is usually primarily responsible for how a given chemical reaction takes place, and how efficiently it does so. The study of reactive intermediates and their chemistry is very important in understanding fundamental aspects of bonding and structure, how chemical reactions take place, and for designing new chemical processes or materials that are useful to society.  Our work involves the direct detection of reactive intermediates and monitoring them as they go away due to chemical reaction.  It involves measuring the rates of their reactions, and ultimately defining the mechanisms by which these reactions take place. Because these molecules typically disappear very quickly due to their very high reactivity, we use pulsed lasers to generate them from stable molecules that we first synthesize in the laboratory, and fast time-resolved spectroscopic methods to monitor their formation and decay. Their formation in this way occurs as a result of a photochemical reaction, and so to be successful, we must also understand the photochemistry of the ""stable"" precursor molecules. This is studied by a variety of chemical and spectroscopic techniques.  Once an efficient precursor to a given reactive intermediate which reacts in well-understood ways is identified, then it is possible to exploit the chemistry for the design of new materials or processes which may be useful to society, which is one of the long-term goals of our work.

   Most of our work involves the study of highly reactive molecules containing silicon, germanium, or tin in intrinsically unstable bonding arrangements, all of which have analogues in organic chemistry.  We are exploring the various factors that control the reactivities of these molecules, the mechanisms of their reactions and how they vary with molecular structure, and developing a better, more detailed understanding of the inter-relationships between like bonding arrangements involving the Group 14 elements.

"Predation, the act of an organism killing another for food, is believed to influence the evolution and diversity of species greatly.  Given the modern biodiversity crisis (70 species per day go extinct), we must understand better those factors that influence life's diversity.  However, many influences, including predation, are hard to estimate, especially in marine settings, where it is difficult to count acts of predation directly.  Similarly, direct observations of the past are impossible, but assessing predation in the fossil record would greatly expand our knowledge.  Thus, we need a means of estimating predation without direct observations.  One solution is to use traces of predation, such as scars on prey shells, to estimate predation.  This research has two goals: first, to test the validity of using predation traces as an estimate of predation intensity, using in-field modern experiments; and second, to apply what was learned from the modern experiments to the fossil record to test for the influence of predation during the Mid-Paleozoic (380-290 million years).  The modern component of the research will involve marking shelled invertebrates at multiple localities.  At each locality, there will be a caged zone excluding predators and an uncaged zone; the difference in deaths between the two zones is attributed to predation.  This mortality rate will be compared to rates of various predatory traces at each locality to determine if any traces successfully track mortality.  If so, traces can be used to compare predation intensity from place to place, and through time.  The paleontological component of the study will use the valid predation traces to test if the Mid-Paleozoic was a time of increasing predation intensity, and if Mid-Paleozoic marine invertebrates evolved new shapes and ""armor"" in response to predation, by comparing changes through time in trace activity and prey shape.  Mid-Paleozoic organisms were not closely related to modern organisms, so if Mid-Paleozoic and Recent organisms were both influenced by the same factors, such a result would be more general, and thus of greater use to biology and conservation.","Earth sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Earth and Atmospheric Sciences","Leighton, Lindsey","RGPIN ","Paleontology, paleobiology","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",1-5

"The proposed project aims to develop natural and/or synthetic renewable binding agents (such as lignin, tall oil, bio-oil, bio-oil based phenolic resins, etc.) for the production of wood pellets with increased calorific values and durability. Raw materials will be provided by local industry was well as from the principle investigators facilities. The importance of wood pellets to the industry now and into the future can be seen as only increasing. The opportunity for the forest sector to improve its bottom line through production of their own energy has large implications for the profitability and feasibility of operating for many companies. The conversion of the Atikokan Power Generating Station to wood pellets also requires pellets of the highest quality and calorific values that are also able to be transported without being broken down. The break down of

pellets has the potential to create volumes of dust that have issues with potential explosions. THe research therefore will look at both the improvement of calorific values through binding agents but also the improvement of pellet durability. The new binding agents and knowledge to be developed from the proposed research would be transferred to the industrial partner (Atikokan Renewable Fuels) and other bio-pellet manufacturers, which will consequently contribute to the creation of jobs and wealth in particular for the rural and remote communities.","Alternative energy resources","Energy resources","Forestry and the Forest Environment, Faculty of","Leitch, Mathew","EGP   ","Wood science and engineering","Forest engineering","G�nie forestier",1-1

"Mobility is an essential contributor for quality of life. However, approximately 90 million people in North America and Europe have a mobility disability. Currently, orthotic devices (braces) are used to deal with many human movement problems. These devices passively support the body or return stored energy to assist mobility. However, combining robotics and orthotics could greatly improve safe mobility, walking style, and reduce the energy needed for walking, climbing stairs, walking up a ramp, etc. Research on such wearable robotic technology is needed to further improve safe mobility for the elderly and people with disabilities beyond current passive assistive devices.

    The Intelligent Mobility Systems programme will develop, evaluate, and implement intelligent assistive devices and related technologies to improve the lives of the elderly and people with disabilities. Recent advances in microprocessors, software, materials, robotics, and mechanical devices provide essential building blocks to add a level of intelligent decision-making and powered motion to mobility and therapeutic devices. The ability of such devices to sense their surroundings and adapt is essential for safe and effective assisted mobility. 

    The Intelligent Mobility Systems research plan involves: wearable mechanical systems, device-human interfaces, and intelligent control systems. Initial research will focus on knee-ankle-foot devices that provide active propulsion during movement and stabilizing approaches to reduce the risk of falling. This will include sensors to measure stability and biomechanical measurement of human movement. A combination of energy storage and return and powered motors will be used to augment mobility. The wearable robotic system will dynamically adapt to a user's profile and activities. The prototype devices will be assessed to ensure that they provide the anticipated mobility benefits for the elderly and people with disabilities.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","Medicine, Faculty of","Lemaire, Edward","RGPIN ","Biomedical technology","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",2-5

There are literally thousands of applications of magnetic materials:  They are found in motors and generators (an automobile engine contains over 20 magnets), in medical devices (such as MRI technology) and implants, in telecommunication, and radar technology and we use magnetic materials to store our data on our computer hard drives.  We are interested in the preparation of new ""molecular"" magnetic materials.  These are different from the ""magnets"" most people are familiar with, like iron oxide or nickel.  We wish to make extremely small magnets-on the scale of single molecules (imagine dividing a human hair into ten thousand fragments-one of these fragments represents the size of our magnet!).  As chemists, we study the structure and properties of matter:  we are also engaged in the preparation of new matter by a process called ""chemical synthesis"".  Most traditional magnets have properties that make the manipulation of their structure very difficult or impossible.  On the other hand, synthetic chemists are able to alter molecular structures.  If we can build magnets based on molecular precursors, we have the opportunity to tune the properties of our materials with our synthetic manipulations.  In this way, we can create magnets with unprecedented properties:  Liquid magnets or plastic magnets are just a couple of the many exciting possibilities; in fact, we hope to use these materials for future applications in magnetic data storage media or as new sensory devices.  We expect our materials to tremendously increase computer data storage capacities and processor speeds in the future, in addition to a number of other exciting potential applications.

CEGEP de Thetford has two technology transfer centers, the CTMP (mineral technology and plastics center) created in 1993 and OLEOTEK (research centre specialized in industrial oleochemistry) created in 2002. Under the leadership of the CEGEP and in order to address the challenges of the plastics industry of Chaudi�re-Appalaches, these two centers have developed effective collaborations relative to the synthesis, the characterization and the implementation of bioplastics, biopolymers and bioadditives. In direct line with the needs of the plastics and composites industry, the purpose of this project is the installation of a permanent structure for financial, administrative and scientific management of research. The goal is the development of

new materials, their implementation and the transfer of related technologies to the companies of the bioplastics sector. Several companies of the area of Chaudi�res-Appalaches will commit money, staff, time and loan of equipment. The project focuses on two principal paths, the development of bio-based technical thermoplastics and thermosets, with reduced environmental impact (biodegradable polymers resulting from biomass). Each axis includes several sub-projects intended to meet the specific needs of the industrial partners. The completion of this project will enable the CEGEP to organize research in the field of bioplastics. This structure will facilitate exchanges between industries, research centres and training centre and will lead to the creation of a regional production stream for polymers having reduced environmental impact.","Not available","Not available","Si�ge social","Lemaire, Michel","CCIP  ","Not available","Not available","Non disponible",1-6

"Mammalian reoviruses have played an important role in our understanding of important biological mechanisms: virus entry, synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, virus evolution, and many more. In addition to their interest as fundamental research tools, possible applications for reoviruses are envisaged. Some viruses, such as reoviruses, can now become our ""allies"" rather than just enemies to fight. The ability of reoviruses to infect humans and a large range of animal species suggests the possibility of developing novel applications for these viruses. Furthermore, it is now clearly established that reoviruses preferentially infect and kill cancer cells; they are thus attractive candidates for the development of ""virotherapy"" anticancer treatments. My laboratory has been actively involved in the study of various aspects of the biology of reoviruses, and this for the last 18 years. Molecular biology, biochemistry, and classical genetics approaches, have been especially useful to dissect the structure and function of viral proteins. It is now proposed to pursue these studies to develop a better fundamental understanding of the viral replication cycle, an understanding that is essential for the development of practical applications for these viruses. Three different proteins will be studied: these are involved in virus entry, discrimination between normal and cancer cells, and virus assembly. We will take advantage of the availability of viral gene sequences and mutants to determine the role of the various proteins and to further modify them using genetic engineering tools. We believe that these studies should significantly contribute to our long-term objectives aimed at developing and optimizing practical applications for reoviruses in animal and human biology.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Microbiologie et immunologie","Lemay, Guy","RGPIN ",Virology,Microbiology,Microbiologie,3-5

"The overall goal of this research program consists of developing new air control technologies and ventilation practices for livestock buildings to minimise their impact on the environment and neighbouring communities.  Specific objectives are as following: 1) to simulate and compare emission reductions using different air treatment techniques in combination with various ventilation strategies; 2) to develop an air cleaning system capable of removing odours, gases and particles exhausted from swine buildings; 3) to measure the air cleaning system efficacy at controlling contaminant emissions both at the bench-scale and at the full-scale levels; and 4) to provide guidance on the development of air control technologies for livestock facilities using the expertise gained over the program.  The current knowledge base will lead the research team towards the most promising filtration, air scrubbing and bio-filtration systems considering the context of livestock buildings.  A theoretical analysis will be performed to predict the overall efficiency of selected techniques at reducing overall emissions of gases, odours and particles with different ventilation configurations and strategies.  A specially designed laboratory at the Research and Development Institute for the Agri-Environment (IRDA, Qu�bec) will be upgraded to evaluate the performance of selected configurations of air cleaning techniques.  Following laboratory tests, full-scale studies will be conducted at Prairie Swine Centre (PSC, Saskatchewan) to confirm the system performance.  Research will be conducted in considering emission control of a single fan as well as of centralised ventilation systems.  If the research program is successful, after its completion, it will be possible to built pig barns emitting an acceptable level of odours.

"    )	Ecological and morphological factors have been proposed to explain the locomotor characteristics typical of primates.  It has been hypothesized that moving and foraging in the trees-especially where terminal branches abound-was the impetus for the evolution of unique locomotor traits very early in primate evolution.  Moreover, some of these locomotor specializations have been linked to potential differences in limb mass distribution (more muscular, grasping hands and feet concentrate more mass at the end of the limbs) or position of the body centre of mass (more posteriorly positioned) compared to other mammals.  Previous research has shown strong similarities of locomotor characteristics typical of primates in two highly arboreal mammals: the woolly opossum and the kinkajou.  To better understand these relationships between structure and function, I propose to examine locomotor biomechanics in species closely related to the woolly opossum and the kinkajou that spend most of their time traveling and foraging on the ground.  Moreover, I plan to study the biomechanics of locomotion in several primate species for which limb mass distribution and position of the body center of mass will be altered experimentally using small weights.  Data on footfall patterns during quadrupedal locomotion, as well as limb movements and forces will be collected on living subjects in the laboratory using high-speed videography, force platform, treadmills, and computer analysis of movement.  The proposed research will fill an important gap of knowledge in the field of mammal locomotor biomechanics and evolution with an emphasis on primates.  These experimental data will provide a comparative framework from which anatomical and locomotor characteristics associated with life in the trees can be elucidated.  Such detailed knowledge of these characteristics in mammals is essential to understanding the origins of primates, and ultimately, the evolution of the human species.

"Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are a vital technology invented 25 years ago to build digital hardware. The key strengths of the technology are instant manufacturing, no up-front manufacturing costs, and the ability to to fix hardware bugs or add features at no cost. These strengths are obtained by prefabricating a generic logic circuit that is configured by the customer using computer-aided design tools. Despite their advantages, FPGAs are estimated to be 40x less dense, 4x slower, and use 12x more power than ASICs.



Improvements and alternatives to FPGAs are needed to overcome these disadvantages. FPGA interconnect dominates the area, power, and delay of the device. FPGA tools cannot easily map parallel software into FPGAs. Structured ASICs are a promising alternative to FPGAs; they vastly improve density, power, and delay by premanufacturing most (but not all) of the semiconductor masks. Single-chip massively parallel processor arrays are a promising alternative to run parallel software, but they can also used to implement high-performance and high-density computaitonal circuits with much faster mapping runtimes and higher capacity limits. Together, these three devices provide very low-cost accessibility to the latest semiconductor technology for implementing digital hardware and highly parallel systems.



The goals of this research are to realize advances in three areas: improved FPGA processing speed through interconnect optimization and vector processing, improved structured ASICs with easier design tools, and demonstrate the ability to efficiently map circuits to massively parallel processor arrays. Combining hardware performance with software cost and ease-of-use leads to dramatic improvements in cost/performance ratio. Achieving this convergence is a key enabler for new applications that will benefit society in important areas such as health care, communications, and scientific computing.

"DNA microarrays allows to quantify the transcripts of genes (mRNAs) in an organism and to identify the modulated genes between two conditions, which reports the modification of molecular mechanisms.  This technology has been heavily investigated since its inception and, recently, consensus is emerging regarding key features of an appropriate analytic pipeline.  One aspect of microarray data that is frequently overlooked is the impact of gene interdependency on the statistical methodologies used.  Since the integrity of the cell (through homeostasis and ordered differentiation) is dependent on a tight coordination of the expression of thousands of genes, it should be expected that variations in the concentration of their mRNA are highly correlated.  

Widely used statistical methods requiring independence to preserve their accuracy are: normalization, multiple test correction procedures and gene ontology functional annotation.  Measuring the level of interdependency of genes on experimental data is still out of reach, and thus its impact on these methods have only be studied from a theoretical point of view.  The challenge of inferring regulatory networks from gene expression data have recently been qualified as an indeterminate problem.  In this proposal, we highlight the need to represent, at a higher level, global features of the dependency network.  These global features are likely to represent ""modes"" in which the cell operates depending on its level of differentiation or the level of complexity of the organism.  Understanding the high level of organization of this network will then allow us to have a better grasp at individual gene's role.  The main objectives of my research program are to 1) measure and take advantage of gene interdependency in genome-wide statistical analysis, and 2) expand the scope of meta-analysis of genome-wide experimental results.

"Researchers work over increasingly large distributed data sets. Literary researchers have access to most classical works in digital format. There are terabytes of biological data freely available on the Web. Sequential data such as text or time series is common and has been identified as an area of critical importance  by the database research community. 



Mining patterns in terabytes of time series or  text with user-driven techniques, is an important open problem. We want to provide tools to users so that they can interactively aggregate sequential data into views, as in On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). To do so, we need well adapted hierarchies over the data so that drill-down and roll-up queries can be supported. We need robust time series indexing. Finally, we need a good model for sequential databases: should we complement existing information retrieval tools or extend current databases? In either case, the amount of data is so large that we need good strategies to preaggregate the data.



In  OLAP, attribute values  are aggregated by star schema hierarchies (store/city/province, client ID/age group). Words can be aggregated in phrases, sentences and paragraphs or by hyponymy (car/vehicle) though there are issues with word sense disambiguation. An equivalent for time series is segmentation. Segmentation divides the data into intervals where it behaves approximately according to a simple model (e.g. constant, linear, quadratic, unimodal, monotonic, convex). Segmentation is  a hierarchical process since intervals can be further subdivided.



Recently, some progress has been made in time warping indexing.  When comparing two time series, time warping locally accelerates or slows time in one time series to compute robust similarity measures.

"Reversible phosphorylation controlled by protein kinases and protein phosphatases is a central regulatory mechanism that allows cells to adapt to environmental changes. In bacteria, phosphorylation is accomplished primarily by two-component regulatory systems that phosphorylate histidine and aspartate residues. In the last decade, phosphorylation of bacterial proteins on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues by eukaryotic-like protein kinases has also been found to play a major role in signaling. Little is known about the mechanism of action and signaling pathways controlled by eukaryotic-like protein kinases in bacteria. We identified in the genomes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), the etiologic agent of typhoid fever, a cluster of genes that is not present in other Salmonella serovars for which the genome has been sequenced. This gene cluster consists of three open reading frames encoding proteins with homology to Ser/Thr protein kinases (prkX and prkY) and protein phosphatase 2C (prpZ). These three genes of opposing functions appear to control a signaling pathway specific to S. Typhi. We showed that deletion of the three genes affects the long-term survival of S. Typhi in macrophages, indicating that these genes are involved in virulence. Here, we propose to better characterize this signaling pathway by examining the enzymatic activities of the three proteins as well as their regulation by covalent modification and identifying the physiological substrate(s) that is(are) reversibly phosphorylated by the three proteins. The proposed research has the potential to provide the first detailed picture of an ""eukaryotic-like"" phosphorylation cascade that could be involved in the long-term persistence of S. Typhi during infection.

"The need for improved methods for understanding and mitigating the risks imposed on communities and the environment due to dam releases, including high flows related to controlled spilling under normal operations, controlled low flows and catastrophic flows under breach events, is widely recognized. This work advances the identification and estimation of such risks and develops methods for assessing alternative structural and non-structural mitigation approaches for reducing them. Community flood loss estimation and the identification of tools that aid in planning for mitigation, warning, and evacuation of communities requires analysis of the risk management concerns faced by stakeholders at a number of planning levels, but in general reduce to questions of whether to inform individuals to escape or to shelter in place. The risk of adverse environmental conditions due to extreme high or low flows, and the mitigation of these impacts, requires the development of environmental response models that are designed to capture extreme events exhibiting intensive rapidly changing behavior. The selection, and development of appropriate modeling tools, investigation of mitigation alternatives, and development of mitigation alternatives, and development of performance indicators for evaluating the effectiveness of the mitigation practices for reducing human and environmental risks, will be undertaken. In evaluating and mitigating community impacts, efforts will be made to address the concerns faced by the asset owner and the community at risk. Additionally, tools for assisting stakeholders in evaluating trade-offs between the community and environmental risks and between alternative mitigation strategies will be developed.","Electrical energy","Energy resources","Civil Engineering","Lence, Barbara","CRDPJ ","Civil engineering","Civil engineering","G�nie civil",1-2
"Maintenance of water quality objectives in natural and constructed environments may be affected by events or inputs that are observable, such as variations in streamflow, and by those that are unobservable, such as mechanical failures, and by our limited understanding of the cause and effect relationships that govern such systems.  The inputs may be stationary in nature, having a constant mean and standard deviation over time, or non-stationary, exhibiting changes in the statistical properties over time, due, e.g., to climate change.  In any case, the expected water quality response to planning and operational decisions may be quite variable, failure to meet water quality objectives may be severe, and the consequences of such failures may be repairable, i.e., functioning, or non-repairable, not functioning, after failures occur.  The types of decisions undertaken to protect water quality in different domains may differ; however the performance objectives are similar and focus on achieving water quality standards as reliably as possible. This project develops analytical techniques, including identification of reliability and other performance measures, for evaluating decisions regarding river water quality and water supply systems.   This project will: 1) advance the use of performance measures for repairable river water quality management systems in cases where the system inputs are non-stationary.  Methods for identifying planning decisions that adapt to changing input conditions will be developed and applied; 2) Develop and investigate the use of performance measures for evaluating when to upgrade water distribution system elements; and 3) Develop methods for estimating and practices for enhancing the reliability of water treatment technologies for meeting health targets.","Environmental impact of economic activities (including agriculture)",Environment,"Civil Engineering","Lence, Barbara","RGPIN ","Water quality, pollution","Environmental engineering","G�nie de l'environnement",2-5
"The standard manner by which raw milk is processed throughout the world involves pasteurization (to destroy all human pathogens) and homogenization (to reduce fat globule size to prevent creaming).  In Canada, provincial laws require that all milk be pasteurized, because raw milk can harbour dangerous microbes such as M. paratuberculosis, L. monocytogenes and E. coli.  Despite this danger, a growing number of consumers wish to drink raw milk because they feel that current processing methods alter the sensory and nutritional qualities of the milk.  Pasteurization does destroy enzymes and immunoglobulins and several of these proteins are known to have health benefits.   High temperatures also facilitate interactions between the whey protein beta-lactoglobulin and kappa-casein, which inhibits rennet activity and alters the texture of cheeses and yoghurt.  Complex formation also hinders the production of protein peptides during aging, thereby altering the sensory qualities of the final cheese.  Connoisseurs know that cheeses produced from raw milk are often superior in taste and texture to those coming from pasteurized milk.  The homogenization step also alters the structure of the skim milk membranes (SMM) present in raw milk, thereby changing its mouth feel.  This project will specifically look at how heat treatment and homogenization alters milk structure.  The applicant has recently published work that was the first to show that casein micelles have a fibril-like structure (J. Dairy Sci. 90:75-89 (2007)) and has proposed a new micelle stabilization mechanism that is consistent with this casein fibril model.  Consequently, this study will first explore how casein micelle fibril structure is altered by elevated temperatures alone and in the presence of beta-lactoglobulin.  Next, the applicant will examine several simple separation techniques (membrane filtration, precipitation, flotation) that can be used on raw milk to remove the various valuable yet unstable components before further processing.  These fractions could then be used as valuable food ingredients or reintroduced into the milk after human pathogens have been destroyed to produce healthier and more functional dairy products.","Processed food products and beverages","Manufacturing processes and products","Food Science","Lencki, Robert","RGPIN ","Separation processes","Chemical engineering","G�nie chimique",2-5
"With growing demand and the pervasive deployment of ICT come important new challenges: sustainability of

the current infrastructure has become a major issue. The perspective of widespread machine-to-machine

communications poses the challenge of potentially trillions of devices flooding limited spectrum resources with

that should be scalable and capable of robustly incorporating this new tide of data and information. The

increasingly pervasive deployment of communication infrastructures has been shown to have a strong impact

oil our environment; as deployed today, the carbon footprint of these technologies is alarmingly high. A

sustainable communications infrastructure must bring the notion of energy efficiency to the forefront in order

and simulation to develop efficient techniques and to evaluate their performance. Candidate techniques will be

implemented in experimental test-beds for demonstration and further investigation of their complexity and

real-time performance in real-life conditions. The industrial partners will have access to the newly developed

"Nanomaterials are at the heart of nanoscience and engineering. This research programme focuses on two types of nanomaterial: 2-dimensional self assembled monolayers (SAMs) and gold nanoparticles (NP).  Each of these nanomaterials has remarkable electrical and optical properties which are central to applications in sensors and opto-electronic devices. In order to exploit these properties researchers must devise ways of controlling the fabrication.  

     SAMs, for example, are readily fabricated using simple techniques, but the outcome is not always predictable. Research will be conducted to understand the molecular level details of SAM formation, in both kinetic and structural terms. Electrochemical studies will focus on the role played by applied potential in determining the final SAM stucture.

      SAM-coated gold nanoparticles (2-5nm diameter) have been much studied, but like their 2-dimensional cousins, little is known about how they form. Detailed structure-property relationships of nanoparticle formation in solution, and their reactivity,  will be obtained using imaging (particularly electron microscopy) and spectroscopic measurements.  Novel techniques for making gold nanoparticles directly on a surface will also be further explored.  Finally, the nanocomposites formed when ligand-capped gold nanoparticles are blended with homopolymers will be studied in terms of the molecular level interactions and how the nanoscale surface of these particles leads to new properties.

"The Silurian (~445 to 415 million years) of the Canadian Arctic Islands, as elsewhere in the then-existing world, were occupied by many unusual organisms, including one dominant group of very abundant marine plankton animals, the graptolites. Graptolites evolved very rapidly and through the Silurian existing species disappeared and new species appeared very frequently, making them excellent fossils to subdivide the Silurian geologic column into many fine time slices, a procedure known as biostratigraphy. The graptolites of the Arctic Islands while continuous through the entire Silurian rock sequence, as is normal elsewhere, are virtually unique in the world in their mode of preservation: their original 3D skeletal material is encased within limestone concretions, and are easily extracted by dissolving the rock in dilute acid, yielding beautifully preserved specimens. As such, the Arctic graptolite sequence is considered to be one of the best in the world. For that reason, I have for years studied, and continue to study, these beautifully preserved graptolites. The procedure for newly recovered material continues as follows: firstly examination of their morphology for new information on their morphology and for species recognition, secondly the continual process of the development and refinement of their biostratigraphy to enable comparison and correlation with the fine time slices of rock elsewhere in the world, and finally from this background to advance the knowledge of their evolutionary history. Graptolites witnessed a number of mass extinctions during the Silurian. One event, well marked in the Arctic, witnessed the abrupt reduction of 50 pre-extinction species to only two post-extinction species, and coincided with a strong drop in sea level, and also with a strong increase Carbon 13. Future studies will examine this in more detail, and extend studies into earlier and later Silurian extinction events, with the goal of better understanding the nature of plankton extinction, and of extinctions in general. Finally, my overriding goal while continuing to learn more about graptolites and their habitats, is to extend that  knowledge to help understand the geological and biological history, including climate, of the Arctic Canada during the Silurian Period.

"Composting is finding increasing application as a sustainable method of recycling organic 'waste' materials. To achieve the highest rates of decomposition, and to minimize odours, the composting process depends on organisms that require oxygen and so the process must be set up to provide adequate aeration of the composting material. While some systems supply air by mechanical means, the most common means of air supply is by natural convection driven by the heat generated within the compost by the organisms involved. This passive aeration is simple in concept, but is influenced in a complex way by a variety of factors including the size of the pile and the porosity of the mixture of material in it. This, in turn is a function of the particle size, moisture content, and the mechanical strength of the various particles in the mixture.

The objective of the work proposed here is to obtain a better understanding of how air moves through windrows of compost, and how this movement is influenced by factors such as those listed above. Experiments will be carried out to obtain both quantitative and qualitative data that will be used in the development of a numerical model of passively aerated compost. This, together with improved visualization of airflow patterns in the compost will provide the basis for improved design and management of composting facilities and processes.

"    )	    )	Animals communicate using a range of signals, from whispered calls between mates to the elaborate displays of courting males. Explaining the structure and diversity of such signals has been a central problem in the study of animal communication. Studies on adult animals show that acoustic signals are often structured in ways that help transmit the signal through the environment and improve reception by receivers.



    )	    )	Young animals also produce acoustic signals, as part of vigorous begging displays used to solicit food from parents. The intensity of these signals has puzzled evolutionary biologists because they appear to waste energy and make the young obvious to predators. Many studies have tried to explain why these begging signals appear so conspicuous, but few have examined the role the environment might play in explaining their structure.



    )	    )	My students and I study parent-offspring communication in birds, with a focus on understanding how conspicuous begging signals may have evolved. In this proposal, we test the idea that selection for effective transmission and reception through the environment of the nest explains the structure of begging signals, particularly begging calls. Specifically, we examine how the acoustics of the nest, acoustic competition from nest mates and environmental noise together affect the types of signals given by young birds.



    )	    )	Understanding how animals communicate is central to understanding all aspects of their social behaviour. Communication between parents and young is particularly important because it affects offspring growth and survival. Our work is the first to address fundamental questions about how the environment affects these important signals. It also examines how noise impacts parent-offspring communication, which is a growing problem for animals living in or near urban areas, where anthropogenic noise is increasing.

"Assessments reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) conclude that capturing and underground storage of carbon dioxide could play a major role in minimizing climate change. Nevertheless, significant uncertainties remain regarding the risks of underground storage. The major concern is the risk of leakage.  Since the CO2 injected into deep underground formations (aquifers, depleted oil and gas reservoirs) is typically less dense than the resident fluids it may flow upwards leaking through any high permeability zones or artificial penetrations such as abandoned wells.

The objective of the proposed research is to develop new methods of accelerating the dissolution of CO2 disposed in deep aquifers to mitigate the risks of its leakage. 

Such methods will reduce the risks of CO2 storage by reducing the duration over which buoyant free phase CO2 is present underground, and will expand the number of reservoirs which are acceptable for storage.

"Almost every function of a living system involves a coordinated and regulated exchange of matter or signals between compartments separated by membranes. Plasma membrane itself is composed of small dynamic compartments - rafts. These rafts are central to the communication of cells with their environs and are highly sensitive to the changes in temperature. Steroids, such as cholesterol and cortisol play an important role in the sensing and regulation mechanisms, which is linked to membrane melting transitions. Dr. Leonenko's and Dr. Vijayan's research collaboration focuses on studying phase transitions in model lipid membrane and fish plasma membrane, and has a goal to elucidate the effect of cortisol and cholesterol on these regulation mechanisms associated with lipid melting. This requires using advanced microscopy methods, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) with precise temperature control. AFM is available in Dr. Leonenko's laboratory, but this instrument currently can operate at room temperature only, and does not allow precise time dependent temperature changes during the imaging. It is critical to add temperature control upgrade to allow for the investigation of melting transitions in model and fish plasma membranes. This will allow us to elucidate the role of different compounds, including xenobiotics, drugs and hormones in the temperature-dependent changes in structure and function of model and animal plasma membrane. Without this equipment we are at a disadvantage as our capabilities are limited to just studying model membranes at room temperature and will no be in a position to study phase transitions. This is especially critical for animal membranes in order to understand the intricacies of membrane structure and function. In order to continue our research and student training in this interdisciplinary research area, the purchase of temperature controller and matching accessories to upgrade the AFM instrument is essential. This equipment is not available at Waterloo and will advance our interdisciplinary research capability, fostering collaborations, and making Waterloo leaders in the area of membrane biophysics and membrane biology.

"Amyloid fibrils are insoluble molecular aggregates composed of proteins. Despite of the differences in native structures of amyloid forming proteins, they form similar amyloid fibrils irrespective of the protein from which they originate. The molecular mechanism of the formation of plaques (which are collections of fibrils), and the reason for initiation of this process, are currently unknown. Although fibril plaque formation is associated with biological membranes in vivo, most of research on fibrillogenesis has been performed in a solution phase, in which ""only protein"" model is considered. Lipid rafts, which are present in cell membrane, are a major aspect of cell organization and central to the communication of cells with their environs. Therefore lipid rafts may play an important role in the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation and the interaction of fibrils with the cell. The proposed research will investigate the nature and functions of lipid rafts and elucidating their role in the molecular mechanism, energetics, and kinetics of amyloid fibril formation. Because of their small (nanometer) size, solving these problems is a demanding undertaking requiring highly advanced microscopic techniques. The interaction between single peptide molecules that results in amyloid fibril formation and interaction of peptides with the lipid membrane will be investigated by atomic force microscopy, novel frequency modulation Kelvin probe force microscopy and atomic force spectroscopy. Forces of interaction at an atomic scale will be studied as the surrounding environment (including lipid composition, the presence of cholesterol or inhibitors) is modified. These new approaches will allow the nature of lipid rafts to be related to their interaction with fibril forming proteins and aggregates. The outcome of this study will provide molecular level insight into the fundamental mechanisms of amyloid fibril formation in the presence of lipid templates, and action of small intermediate toxic aggregates on model membranes. This knowledge is essential to develop a more sophisticated model for amyloid fibril formation and the role of membrane heterogeneity in this process and will help to facilitate the development of therapies for amyloid-related diseases.","Physical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Physics and Astronomy","Leonenko, Zoia","RGPIN ",Biophysics,Physics,Physique,3-5

"Internet-based applications have had a profound impact on how we communicate (instant messaging, Skype), interact with our peers (Facebook, LinkedIn), find information (Google), make purchasing decisions (eBay, Amazon), are entertained (YouTube, iTunes), and travel (GPS, location).  All of these applications are supported by software operating on a largely invisible ""cloud"" of communications and computing equipment.  The innovation and creativity that led to these new applications will continue unabated and will place increasing demands on the future computing cloud.  Moreover, the continued improvement in the cost and capabilities of computing and communications provides an opportunity to marshal the next generation of cloud computing to support applications that address societal-scale problems.  Two important examples of such large scale applications are:  Real-time control of regional vehicular traffic and energy consumption to minimize carbon emissions;  Monitoring and control of health system resources to provide responsive and efficient services to a community.     

     This research project supports a core set of activities in a research program that addresses the following questions.  What architectures can enable the rapid creation of large numbers of diverse new applications, both small as well as global-scale, over the future computing cloud? What scalable infrastructure architecture for cloud computing should guide the organization of the next generation resources:  dense multi-core processors, memory, data storage and optical communications? How can the resources in the computing cloud be controlled to ensure that these applications meet specified ""Qualities of Experience?""  What mechanisms can flexibly redeploy resources to enable automatic deployment of applications?  How can these mechanisms be directed to optimize carbon emission and non-renewable resource usage?  

     This research benefits Canada by stimulating the creation of commercial products and services, and supporting the competitiveness of the Canadian economy through the application of ICT.

"Episodic memory denotes a memory system specialized for events and their specific context including time and space. This memory system relies on multiple brain regions including the hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures, the prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex among other regions. In the past few years and with funding from NSERC, my students and I have been exploring multiple dimensions of this episodic memory system using a cognitive neuroscientific approach. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we have examined neural correlates of memory interference (Lepage et al., 2005; Blondin et al., in press) associative and item memory (Achim et al., 2005; 2006; 2008), emotional memory (Sergerie 2005; 2006; 2007; Harvey 2007), perceptual priming (Blondin 2005), and more recently memory for actions (Pelletier et al., in preparation). 

This renewal proposal builds on our previous experiences with fMRI, and Event Related Potentials (Brodeur et al., submitted). The first one seeks to develop electrophysiological measures (ERPs) to better characterize memory processes. Specifically we will used two memory tasks we have developed in the past, namely emotional face memory, memory interference, and action memory to develop electrophysiological indices of those processes. Secondly, we will pursue the exploration of emotional memory, associative memory using fMRI. Ultimately, our goal will be to integrate within the same study, performance, electrophysiological, and hemodynamic measures to thoroughly describe specific episodic memory processes.  

This proposed program builds on our previous studies in healthy participants and as it has been the case in the past, will also be extremely relevant for our research program on the cognitive neuropsychiatry of schizophrenia (e.g. Lepage et al., 2006; 2008; Achim et al., 2007; Sergerie et al., submitted).

"In recent years it has been demonstrated that bacteria communicate with one another, in a process called � Quorum Sensing �. In this mechanism, bacteria secrete one or many signalling molecules which, when they have reched a specific concentration in the medium, bind to their corresponding regulator protein that will increase the production of the signalling compounds and will also activate other virulence genes. During the early stage of an infection, the advantage of such synchronized behaviour is to wait until the number of bacteria is sufficiently large so that the simultaneous release of virulence factor could overwhelm the host defence.

    )	In this study, we want to characterize the enzymatic systems involved in the biosynthesis of one new family of signalling molecules called 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs). These compounds are signalling molecules produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa , an opportunistic pathogen responsible for most fatalities for people afflicted with cystic fibrosis. The objective of the work is to isolate the enzymes responsible for HAQ synthesis in order to better understand how they function and eventually find specific inhibitors of these enzymes. By preventing the synthesis of these compounds, we believe we could inhibit part of the quorum sensing mechanism in this bacterium, and thus reduce its pathogenicity. Inhibiting bacterial virulence is another way to prevent an infection, leaving to the host natural defence the role of eliminating a bacteria rendered less virulent. This approach is likely to be less prone to the development of resistance, a problem that pleagues the use of antibiotics which target bacterial viability rather than virulence.

"The objectives of this program is to study the functional organization of sensory and callosal systems and their contribution to emotional processing in normal and brain challenged humans within two themes:

A- For years we have studied split-brain or callosal agenesis subjects at the psychophysical and imaging levels. We shall continue to do so: at the auditory level, we shall carry out fMRI and MEG studies and look at reorganization to try and determine more precisely how the two hemispheres communicate. We shall also study visual-tactile interactions at the psychophysical and MEG levels and try to identify the mechanisms. In addition, we shall look at how acallosal and callosotomized individuals integrate unilaterally presented emotional stimuli.

B- We have carried out numerous studies using psychophysics and imaging techniques (fMRI, MEG, EEG). With fMRI, temporal resolution is poor whereas in EEG, localization must be computed through source analysis techniques. MEG is somewhat in between these two. We have thus developed a collaboration that will allow us to test subjects implanted with sub-dural grids (and also intracranial electrodes) that will allow us to  improve resolution, as well as determine the dynamics of activations.  We shall look at evoked responses when subjects are presented with scrambled visual stimuli that have to be integrated to examine coherence between areas and neuronal binding. We shall also examine how priming transfers across the hemispheres. At the auditory level, we shall examine the differential treatment and structures of the ventral (""what?"") and dorsal (""where"") streams and see how they interact, as well as the dynamics of treatment. Electrodes placed in emotion related structures will allow us to identify the structures involved and how these interact during treatment and integration of emotions. We shall continue our studies examining visual-auditory interactions in emotional treatment.

"The rheometer requested will be shared by two researchers located at the CHUM research center (CRCHUM). This equipment with allow to characterize hydrogels and other soft synthetic and biological tissues, for several innovations in the biomedical field. The research program aims to optimize promising embolizing agents for minimally invasive treatments of vascular diseases. Lerouge's Canada Research Chair on Endovascular Implants and Biomaterials is currently developing new approaches and materials to provide safe and efficient treatments. The rheometer will be used to characterize and optimize radioopaque thermogels, which are liquid at room temperature and gelling at body temperature. The equipment will also be utilized to validate a new innovative rheometry technique and to characterize materials used for the validation of elastography techniques developed by Cloutier, director of the Laboratory of Biorheology and Medical Ultrasonics (LBUM) at the CRCHUM. These new elastrography imaging methods possess a great potential in view of the fact that they can determine the mechanical properties of observed biological tissues. In both cases, extensive characterization of soft materials involved (hydrogel, biological tissues or tissue-mimicking materials) is required. The rheometer requested will allow testing of viscous solutions, gels and pastes, at controlled temperatures. The system chosen is well adapted for high precision research as well as student training, since it includes an easy set up to minimize operator errors. Preliminary promising data were obtained with an old rheometer which is used to study bitumen at �cole de technologie sup�rieure (�TS). But its lack of availability, the distance between the CRCHUM and �TS and more particularly the impossibility to use this system with biological products make the purchase of a new dedicated rheometer absolutely necessary to achieve the proposed research program and bring these innovations into the clinical reality.

VERSION ANGLAISE: Cardiovascular (CV) diseases are the major cause of illness, disability and death in Canada.. Many current therapies use vascular grafts or, more recently, minimally-invasive stent-graft (SG) prostheses, to restore normal blood flow in diseased vessels, but these implants still frequently give rise to complications such as thrombosis and incomplete healing, for example. Objectives of this proposed program are to help overcome such problems by applying a new class of thin, polymer-like coatings, so-called ""PPE:N"" (nitrogen-rich plasma-polymerised ethylene) to the polymeric biomaterials presently used in the manufacture of CV prostheses: In much recent collaborative work among team members, PPE:N has been found to possess remarkable characteristics in promoting cell adhesion, growth, migration on surfaces, and resistance to apoptosis, for the case of many different cell lines, including ones of utmost relevance to CV therapies, for example VSMC and fibroblasts. There is also much evidence that the performance of PPE:N will be even further enhanced by grafting suitable growth factors to its chemically-active surface sites, primary amines (-NH2), and powerful new techniques to this effect have been developed within the team. Indeed, all of the specialty fields required to carry out this highly multidisciplinary program exist within the team, namely (CV)-biomaterials scientists, biochemists and biochemical engineers, and clinicians specialised in interventional radiology and vascular surgery. The proposed program is deemed to have very high potential for success, for technology transfer, and it is ideally-suited for training HQP, all these while addressing problems of supreme importance for the health of Canadians.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","G�nie m�canique","Lerouge, Sophie","CHRPJ ","Biomedical materials","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",2-3

"There is increasing optimism with respect to nanotechnology giving rise to significant advances in the fields of cancer diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, the use of water-soluble polymers as nanocarriers of cytotoxic drugs has attracted wide interest. It is now well-established that long-circulating drug-polymer conjugates accumulate in a variety of solid tumors at much higher concentrations than in normal tissues. Due to their limited distribution in healthy tissues, they often display safer toxicological profiles than control drug solutions. However, despite these attractive characteristics, polymeric conjugates are seldom associated with a greater antitumoral activity than the free drug at equivalent doses. This can often be rationalized in terms of insufficient intracellular concentrations of bioavailable drug due to a slow release rate of the active agent in the tumor cells. Indeed, for optimal cytostatic activity, the drug should be rapidly released from the carrier upon reaching the malignant cells. To achieve this objective, we propose to construct polymer conjugates whereby the drug is released as a result of the conformational change of a nanomechanical device (i.e. molecular tweezer) grafted to the polymeric backbone. Molecular tweezers can be designed to express very high affinity for a substrate when in a specific conformation, and then rapidly lose their binding properties following a change in their molecular shape. This conformational change can be triggered by acidification of the external medium, a condition that is encountered by macromolecular drugs following their uptake by the tumor cells.

"The forces between molecules and between the individual atoms within a molecule are responsible for most physical and chemical properties of gases, liquids and solids, and they govern the exchange of energy by molecular collisions in the atmosphere and other environments. The best experimental probe of such interactions is the discrete high resolution spectroscopy of pairs of interacting atoms and molecules.  In particular, experimental observations of the particular patterns of ""colours"" (or wavelengths) of light absorbed or emitted by a particular molecular species can in principle be inverted to yield a detailed knowledge of these forces.  A central theme of the proposed work is the development and application of theoretical and computational methods for extracting such information from experimental data, and for predicting other molecular phenomena using the resulting knowledge of intermolecular potential energy functions.



ONE PART of the work focuses on very precise studies of two- and three-atom molecules which are small enough that it is possible to perform unified analyses of multiple types of data for different isotopic forms of the same chemical system.  Such unified analyses allow us to extract from experiment both accurate knowledge of the intermolecular forces, and subtle information about the coupling between different electronic states and the dependence of the the electronic wavefunctions on internuclear separation.  This in turn allow us to make reliable predictions of unobserved portions of the spectra and other properties of such systems.



ANOTHER project is concerned with developing and applying methods of simulating the spectroscopic signature of a probe ""chromophore"" molecule solvated in a molecular cluster or trapped in or on a solid matrix.  The ability to make accurate  predictions of this type will allow us to use such spectroscopic measurements to probe the nature of the microscopic environment where the chromophore molecule is located.

"The long-term goal is to develop a general ecosystem model for lakes in the Mackenzie Delta to facilitate assessing the effects of multiple stresses on major river floodplains [33-35] resulting from global change [2]. The delta contains 45,000 lakes [16] and is representative of floodplain lakes among major river deltas of the circumpolar arctic [2], a region of the world where climate is changing more rapidly than anywhere else [36]. Circumpolar river deltas are lake-rich because of thermokarst effects [16]. These systems are complex [37-39] and represent thousands lakes [40] that function as critical aquatic habitat for fish, birds, and mammals. They are sensitive to global change because thermokarst and river-ice breakup effects are highly temperature dependent [41], and because deltas are affected by processes occurring throughout their drainage basin [2]. Significant advances in this research over the past 6 yr includes improved understanding of (1) aquatic autotrophs, bacteria, and zooplankton; (2) under-water irradiance; (3) photochemical effects on dissolved organic C (DOC) and aquatic bacteria; (4) sources and fates of DOC in delta foodwebs; (5) Mackenzie Delta effects on riverine nutrient fluxes to the Beaufort Sea; (6) Mackenzie Delta fit within ecological models of large river floodplains; (7) 89 hypotheses formulated on responses of delta lakes to combined stresses of global change; and (8) detection of changes in water level regime. Next 5 years will involve continuing efforts to assess the strength and direction of delta lake responses to individual stresses of global change. Specific goals include assessing: (1) delta aquatic habitat modeling through dynamic range of water levels; (2) lake flooding, land/water ratios, and landscape changes in delta; (3) photochemical production of H2O2 and biolabile-DOC; (4) responses of aquatic bacteria to declining flooding regime; (5) foodweb controls on heterotrophic nanoflagellates; and (6) abundance and bacterial colonization of transparent exopolymer particles. DG funds, with requested NRS, will facilitate training and research of 2 PhD and 3 MSc students plus 5 field assistants in arctic-based research.

"To clear pathogens and prevent infections, one must mount an efficient immune response. Dendritic cells are the most potent cell type for the initiation of effective responses to pathogens. In recent years, there has been a much accrued interest in the manipulation of dendritic cells for the development of new therapeutic protocols in cancer and autoimmunity. Moreover, the potential of using dendritic cell for vaccine development is currently being investigated. Fundamental research programs examining dendritic cells have led to the identification of various subsets. However, the specific role of each of these subsets remains to be resolved. 



Interestingly, inbred strains of mice show variations in the number of dendritic cell subsets. The genetic code of each inbred strain has been determined. We will thus take advantage of these inbred strains to define the genetic trait underlying the control of dendritic cell subset numbers. 



This project will further our understanding of the dendritic cell population dynamics and may contribute to defining the specific role of dendritic cell subsets in immune responses. This information may then be used to improve dendritic cell vaccination protocols.

"Extinction is a common fate to any species. However, determining the causes and processes is often difficult. Increasing evidence suggests that amphibians are actually facing a global decline representing a singular opportunity to study the biology of extinction. Among other causes, emerging infectious diseases are involved in this decline. They consist of a fungal infection responsible in extinctions all around the world as well as another group of amphibian pathogens, ranaviruses, which have been shown to only cause local mortality but no known extinction. While the physiological mechanisms of these pathogens are well understood, the ecological and genetic components of the host-pathogen relationship remain to be studied. Understanding infectious disease ecology and evolution is a key to the more general investigation of extinction. Therefore amphibians are an excellent model for studying such a process in the wild. Not only do they suffer from these emerging infectious diseases but they also face anthropogenic and ecological pressure in many of their habitats. Only by exploring the role of these diseases in broad context will we be able to both test pathogen-induced extinctions and address appropriate conservation solutions. To this end, I will establish a long-term program in northern Ontario, where a matrix of disturbed and undisturbed habitats are present, and the diseases have been recently recorded. Using a combination of field observations and experiments, I will be able to investigate the pathogen mechanisms leading to the decline of local populations. Considering the current knowledge and theory on population genetics and EIDs, the hypotheses that will be tested in this application are (1) host differences in susceptibility and mortality have a significant genetic component (2) EIDs are not only causing mass mortalities within populations, but also affect individual development and (3) environmental factors affect the extensive spread of the diseases and the susceptibility of infection. In the context of the global amphibian decline, the program can be viewed as an attempt to bridge ecology and genetics to create a field that might be termed as evolutionary conservation genetics.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Biology,"Lesbarr�res, David","RGPIN ","Evolution and ecology","Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",3-5
"The aim of this research program is to understand how some of the world's largest nickel-copper-platinum deposits in Canada, China, and Russia have formed, in order to aid in the discovery of new deposits. Each project includes detailed mapping of field exposures, logging of diamond drill cores, examinations of the rocks using light optical and electron optical microscopic techniques, analysis of the chemical and isotopic compositions of the ores and the rocks in which they occur, and mathematical models of the geochemical and fluid dynamic processes involved in their formation. The data and interpretations generated in this program will extend our knowledge of the processes involved in generating nickel-copper-platinum deposits, and the geological, genetic, and exploration models generated in the various projects will have broad applications and will aid in their exploration worldwide.

"My research proposal involves projects that are grounded in joint research with biological and health scientists.   

   Correspondence analysis (CA) is a descriptive technique designed to investigate the association between row and column variables by graphically displaying the patterns in the data.  I propose to explore and develop variations of CA techniques to identify differentially expressed genes and to investigate the use of CA to assess the quality of replicate DNA arrays.

   Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and a related technique called joint correspondence analysis (JCA) are methods for visualizing the joint features of 2 or more categorical variables. We have been working with the Genetic Pathology Evaluation Centre (GPEC) at UBC and the Breast Cancer Outcomes Unit (BCOU) at the B.C. Cancer Agency to study relationships between molecular markers and outcomes for breast cancer.  Some researchers have incorporated survival information in an MCA analysis using supplementary points without regard to censoring.  I propose to develop techniques that accommodate possibly censored outcomes in MCA and JCA analyses of marker data.  

   For patients with life-limited illness, knowing how much time remains is often important for decision-making regarding goals of care, treatment options and dealing with closure on personal and family matters.  Research has shown that clinicians tend to overestimate survival times thus demonstrating the need for objective prognostic indicators.  The Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) is one such measure that, together with gender, disease and age, has been shown to be an effective predictor of survival.  Since the PPS trajectory cannot be treated as an external time-dependent covariate, I propose to develop joint longitudinal/survival models that account for the categorical nature of the longitudinal data.

"The main objective of my research is to identify factors which influence the reactivity of reactive intermediates (radicals, radical ions, and chemisorbed hydrogen (Hads)), and to comprehend at the molecular level, how these factors affect their reactivity.  I. REACTIVITY of amidyl radicals.- We will synthesize new model precursors of cyclic amidyls constrained to react in the pi electronic state (unpaired e- in a pi orbital) and precursors allowing to compare the reactivity of the pi and sigma (unpaired e- in the plane of the sigma bonds) states.  II. RING CONTRACTION of N-substituted lactams.- We discovered that photolysis of N-chloro- and N-Omesyl-lactams (6- and 7-membered ring) gives the corresponding ring-contracted nitrogen heterocycle with 100% retention of configuration at the migrating carbon. The proposed research will involve: mechanistic studies (influence of substituents at various positions of the lactam ring, of the conformational bias of the ring, and of isotopic labelling); development of general syntheses of N-hydroxylactams; synthesis and diazotation of N-aminolactams; applications to the synthesis of N-heterocyclic natural products. III. ELECTROORGANIC CHEMISTRY.- 3a. Cleavage of nitro radical anions.- We will generate, by electroreduction, the radical anion of a series of 1-nitrocyclopropanes / cyclobutanes and 1-(4-nitrophenyl)-cyclopropanes / cyclobutanes having various substituents at positions 1 and 2 (alkyl groups, electron-donating /-attracting groups) and determine the type of cleavage (homolytic vs. heterolytic) and their rate of cleavage using cyclic voltammetry (homogeneous redox catalysis for very rapid cleavage), coulometry and preparative electrolysis (product identification). 3b. ElectroCatalytic Hydrogenation (ECH).- ECH of an organic compound involves reaction of Hads (generated on the electrode surface by reduction of water) with the adsorbed org. substrate. Surface and kinetic studies on single crystals aims at i) identifying / understanding the factors influencing the efficiency and selectivity, ii) identifying the nature of H(ads) active in hydrogenation, and iii) determining how the electrocatalyst and reaction conditions affect the rates (hydrogenation vs. H desorption).

"Man-made chemicals that persist and bioaccumulate in the environment are increasingly being linked to adverse effects in wildlife and humans. Many bioaccumulative ""legacy"" and ""emerging' contaminants found wildlife contain chlorine and bromine, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the brominated flame retardant (BFR) class known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). An organism's ability to eliminate organohalogens and other foreign chemicals from the body is dependent on enzymes that can mediate metabolism and biotransformation. Much remains unknown as to role and significance of biotransformation (e.g., oxidative and debromination processes) in the fate and bioaccumulation of chlorinated and brominated organohalogens, which includes the formation of hydroxyl- (OH-) containing or ""phenolic"" metabolites, in different species and food webs, and especially in top predator wildlife. As has been shown for PCBs and PBDEs in some wildlife, biotransformation can lead to persistent OH-PCB and OH-PBDE metabolites, although there remains minimal understanding of the formation, bioaccumulation and toxicokinetics of these ""second level"" pollutants. OH-PCBs, OH-PBDEs, related phenolic compounds/metabolites, and debrominated products of PBDEs and current-use BFRs are ""bioactive"" via hormone mimicry, and can interfere with thyroid hormone-dependent functions and processes (e.g., hormone transport and enzyme-mediated inter-conversion). Endocrine (thyroid) activity and effects in relation to organohalogen biotransformation has received minimal attention in top predator, marine wildlife, which accumulate high organohalogen levels. The proposed research will expand the understanding and commence with new research on the species-specific role, mechanisms and environmental ecological importance and significance of biotransformation in the fate, bioaccumulation and thyroid hormone transport/inter-conversion, on legacy and emerging, chlorinated and brominated organics in top-predator wildlife sentinels of contaminant and other (e.g., climate change) stresses from the Great Lakes (herring gulls) and the Arctic (polar bears and glaucous gulls).

"Almost all integrated circuits are fabricated using planar technology. As a result, integrated circuits components occupy only the top 5-20 microns of the silicon substrate. 



Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) research often uses well-established integrated circuit processes. Unfortunately, the planar structure limits MEMS devices performance, and expanding to the third dimension is necessary. One approach is to elevate planar structures out-of-plane to form three-dimensional (3-D) microstructures. Generally a mechanical force is required to carry out the lifting. Researchers have used thin film stress, magnetic force, electrostatic force, centrifugal force, and surface tension to lift 3-D microstructures out of the silicon surface plane. While these approaches have different levels of success, their applications are limited to the research laboratories in a small scale. Applying them in the production environment remains a major challenge. In this research, we will develop a cost-effective means of elevating 3-D microstructures. Specifically we will develop techniques and device structures which can exploit the mechanical motion and force of an automatic wire bonder in the assembly of 3-D microstructures. Automatic wire bonding is a standard integrated circuits packaging operation which provides electrical connection to the silicon chip. It is a mechanical process in which gold or aluminum wires are welded onto the bond pads of the silicon chip and the package. The wire bonding machine moves the package and silicon chip in the X and Y directions to align the bond wire to the bond pad, and provides a vertical bond head motion and force to complete the welding process. Utilizing this motion and force capabilities to lift the 3-D microstructures has the advantage that only standard equipment (automatic wire bonder) compatible with volume production is required. Applications of this cost-effective 3-D microstructure include accelerometer, optical components, anemometer, magnetometer, low-cost radio frequency coil structure etc.

"With the advance in technology, a flood of data can be produced in many applications such as wireless sensor networks. Consequently, we are drowning in data but starving for knowledge. To be able to ''drink from a fire hose'' (i.e., to make sense of the flood of data), methods for extracting useful information from the flood of data are in demand. This calls for data mining, which refers to the search for implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge (such as frequent patterns and exceptional patterns) that might be embedded in the data. Over the past few years, I have developed interactive algorithms for finding frequent patterns satisfying a certain class of constraints. The algorithms are enhanced with some optimizations such as a light-weight structure that provides sharper bounds on the frequency of frequent patterns. Furthermore, I have also developed a novel tree structure for effectively capturing and updating the contents of the database in an incremental environment. Along this direction, I propose to build a more efficient, user-friendly, and powerful mining system such that it (i) incorporates users' preferences, (ii) allows users to visualize the data, (iii) permits users to change the mining parameter and/or constraints during the mining process, (iv) provides users with comprehensible feedback in a ''real-time'' fashion, (v) discovers and exploits any unknown properties of constraints to avoid unnecessary computation and to further speed up performance, and (vi) keeps a good fusion of theory and practice via the exploration of real-life applications (e.g., mining from market basket data, Web click stream, agricultural/meteorological data, and medical/biomedical data). The discovered frequent patterns reveal the common trends; the discovered exceptional patterns trigger alarm bells for prevention of outbreaks or disasters. In the long term, this proposal can also be extended to handle various types of data, ranging from traditional alphanumeric data to non-traditional multimedia data, from structured data to semi-structured XML data, and from traditional ''static'' transactional data to ''dynamic'' streams of continuous data.","Information systems and technology","Information and communication services","Computer Science","Leung, CarsonKaiSang","RGPIN ","Database management","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",3-5

"During the past decade, a major development in the telecommunications industry has been the explosive growth of the cellular telephone market. There are currently over two billion subscribers world-wide. In the US alone, the cellular service industry generates an annual revenue in excess of one hundred billion dollars. Even though the demand for cellular phone service shows no sign of slowing down, the industry is preparing for the next wave of innovation which includes wireless services such as high-speed data, audio/video streaming for web conferences, news, lectures, music, movies, etc. These different applications require inherently different Quality of Service (QoS) levels. The challenge is to design systems capable of supporting applications which are both appealing and affordable.



Beyond the cellular network, there is a whole range of emerging wireless communication technologies. Ultrawide bandwidth technology is being proposed for very high speed data transfers over short distances. New generation wireless local area networks are being designed to support higher bit rates while offering improved security. Standards are being adopted for wireless metropolitan area networks which will establish wireless local loops to the home. Mobile ad-hoc and sensor networks are emerging as potentially important for specific applications.



This research program will investigate a number of issues related to the design and performance analysis of multimedia wireless communication systems. It will train highly qualified personnel in the telecommunications field, one in which Canada has historically made significant research contributions. The results from this research will assist in the development of innovative communication services to the consumer at an affordable cost.

"This minor equipment application seeks the support for a critical repair to a vital component in the Imaging ESCA Microprobe at the University of Waterloo.  Equipped with multiple techniques (including X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, depth profiling, chemical-state imaging, scanning electron microscopy, and Auger electron microscopy), the Thermo VG Scientific ESCALab 250 system represents one of the best laboratory-based imaging ESCA instruments in the world.  The Waterloo machine is also the only ESCALab 250 system in Canada and is a state-of-the-art, laboratory-based ESCA instrument capable of chemical-state imaging at high spatial resolution.  This imaging ESCA system has been in operation since 2000 and has been under heavy usage, serving the research needs of over 75 local research groups from the University of Waterloo and 30 academic groups from other Canadian universities.  Specifically, the requested support will allow us to replace the crucial 5-motion computer-controlled manipulator that suffered a catastrophic failure on 16 May 2008.  Without a working manipulator, it will not be possible for the user (1) to transfer the sample from the load-lock chamber into the analysis chamber, (2) to perform signal optimization of the inverse magnetic-bottled lens by varying the working distance (z-position), and (3) to acquire data at specific location (x,y position) of the sample under computer control, rendering this $2.5 M instrument quite unusable.  This repair will bring the Waterloo ESCALab system back up to full operation, with its state-of-the-art performance.  The requested repair is critically needed for the continued survival of the diverse materials science and engineering research programs at Waterloo.

"Fast response is the most effective measure to protect the public from infectious disease outbreaks (e.g., 2003 SARS in Toronto, and bird flu in recent years) and bioterrorism (e.g., 2001 anthrax attack in the United States), and to provide early detection of toxic pollutants in our environment and of microbial contamination of our food supply. The proposed project seeks to develop a novel multiplex sensor system that is based on nanoscale field-effect transistors (involving carbon nanotubes and transparent oxide nanowalls). By deploying these nanobiosensors in public places (hospitals, schools, airports, transit systems, sporting arenas, shopping malls), this nanobiosensor system offers fast, parallel detection of multiple airborne pathogens (including viruses, bacteria, and toxins) simultaneously, thereby providing an early warning system of any dangerous substances in the air that we breathe. Our study will specifically focus on developing the general methodologies for (a) the fabrication of this nanoscale electronic sensor system based on novel nanomaterials, and (b) biofunctionalization of the transistors with appropriate receptors to capture the target pathogens of interest as whole-organisms. These methods can be generalized and extended to develop the appropriate nanobiosensors to facilitate detection of most of the common airborne viruses and environmental toxins in a typical Canadian city like Toronto or Waterloo. The proposed project will take advantage of the high surface-area-to-volume ratio and the surface structures of carbon nanotubes and transparent oxide nanostructured materials to dramatically enhance the uptake of bioreceptors, which will in turn greatly increase the detection efficiency of the biosensors. By building an array of these nanobiosensors onto a single chip, we can increase the efficiency

further and provide the possibility of detecting multiple pathogens of the same or different families. By working together with our contributing partner (who is commercializing a detection system for water-borne pathogens), we provide complete sampling of both airborne and water-borne pathogens, thus offering a complete protection system against disease carriers for the public.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services",Chemistry,"Leung, KamTong","STPGP ","Materials science and technology","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",2-3

Using specialized tools such as pulsed laser deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, we will also develop new classes of functional nanomaterials, which would not only provide important test beds for investigating fundamental processes on complex surfaces, but also serve as basic platforms for developing new applications in the emerging field of nanotechnology.  Three specific programs are proposed: (a) Organosilicon surface chemistry involving the Si dangling bonds:  Special emphasis will be placed on studying the surface biochemistry of organic acids containing multiple functional groups, evolution of organic semiconductor oligomers, surface reactions of DNA nucleobase groups, and processes induced by low-energy electrons/ions.  (b) Ice surface chemistry:  Adsorption of simple amino acids and DNA nucleobase groups on ice may hold the key to life formation in the primordial world.  Following the surface chemistry leading to the formation of peptide bonds on ice as a function of temperature would be of great interest. (c) Nanostructured materials:  The development of novel metallic core-shell nanoparticles has provided much of the recent commercial applications in catalysis and electronics.  Magnetic nanoparticles offer new prospects for field-directed growth, self-assembly and patterning in an external magnetic field.  Fabricating half-metallic ferromagnetic nano-films (including CrO2, Sr2FeMoO6, Fe3O4, and metal-doped ZnO) provides the basic material platforms for spintronics, photovoltaics and photonics.

"Recent advances in very-low-power wireless communications, including the development of ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) and ultra low power Bluetooth (introduced previously by Nokia as Wibree) have stimulated great interest in the development and application of wireless technology in biomedical applications, including wireless body area sensor networks (WBASNs). A WBASN consists of multiple sensor nodes capable of sampling, processing, and communicating one or more vital signs (e.g., heart rate, brain activity, blood pressure, oxygen saturation) and/or environmental parameters (location, temperature, humidity, light) over extended periods. Typically, these sensors are placed strategically on the human body or hidden in users' clothing to enable ubiquitous monitoring of the users and their environments. Low-cost wearable WBASNs that do not require precise close coupling with the human bodies are especially advantageous for widespread applications in fields as diverse as emergency medicine, long-term health care, athletic training, workplace safety, consumer electronics, secure authentication, and safe-guarding of uniformed personnel. The overall goal of this project is to contribute to the development of the channel models, protocol designs, security methods, cross-layer designs and sensor data processing techniques that will make WBASNs more secure, reliable, and effective and thereby make their widespread deployment practical and commercially viable. These enabling technologies will be developed through interdisciplinary collaborations between academia, industry, non-profit health-care organizations, and government research laboratories. Researchers from the University of British Columbia, Carleton University, Neil Squire Society and Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) will work closely with industry partners including Nokia, Agilent Technologies, Ascalade Communications Inc., and Western Clinical Engineering to advance enabling technologies for WBASNs while training a large number of highly qualified personnel at the postgraduate and undergraduate levels to serve the needs of the growing wireless communications, biomedical engineering and tele-health industry in Canada.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Advancement of knowledge","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Leung, Victor","STPGP ","Wireless communication systems","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",2-3
"Recent advances in wireless communications, signal processing and microelectronics technologies have resulted in the proliferation of wireless networking applications. There are increasing demands for higher data rates and bandwidths, lower costs and longer battery lives for mobile devices. There is substantial current interest on developing cognitive radio (CR) networks to meet these demands. The main application of CRs is for opportunistic access by secondary users on a license-free basis to spectrum holes left unused by the primary users. Although the practicality of this application depends on government regulations and may not be pervasive on a global basis, the general principles of CRs are more profound. The two main principles of CRs are: (1) Cognition - to observe and learn about the environment, and (2) Adaptivity - to make decisions and take actions based on cognitive information, evaluate the results and adjust strategies to improve performance. These principles merit in-depth investigations with regard to their general applications not only in radio communications but also the design of protocols and management algorithms for wireless networks. This motivates the overall objectives of the current proposal: to develop, evaluate and implement novel system architecture, protocols and management techniques that utilize cognition and adaptivity to improve the designs and enhance the performance of wireless network systems. Success in achieving these objectives will substantially contribute to the future availability of advanced wireless networks and mobile devices that meet the growing demands of mobile applications and wireless communications outlined above. To address these objectives, we propose the following research tasks: (1) Cognitive wireless local area network over optical fibres, (2) Architectures, protocols and management techniques to realize CR networks, (3) Mobility, location and application aware cognitive wireless networks. These tasks will be accomplished through novel design and performance evaluations by means of theoretical and simulation models. Utilizing a proposed experimental testbed, promising techniques will be implemented and evaluated under realistic conditions.

"My research program will provide a better understanding of abrupt climatic changes that occurred during the last 11,000 years, a topic currently of interest to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in view of the potentially serious implications such abrupt changes have on human societies. These events are difficult to replicate using numerical climate models, so paleoclimatic proxy data is indispensable to their study. It is not possible now to identify the primary cause of abrupt climatic events among meltwater discharges, natural climatic variability, shifts in oceanic currents, and solar influence. Since there is not even consensus about the source and routing (path) of some large meltwater releases that occurred during the last deglaciation, it is not possible to confirm or rule out their role in abrupt climate cooling events. This project will focus on meltwater source and paths believed to have caused such severe cooling events as the Younger Dryas and the Preboreal oscillation. I will verify if large amounts of meltwater from glacial Lake Agassiz (and/or other glacial lakes) were discharged through the St. Lawrence River between 11,000 and 7000 years ago. In order to do so, I will study high resolution marine sediment cores from strategic locations to detect any meltwater releases through that route. Sea surface temperature and salinity will be reconstructed using dinoflagellate cysts data and transfer functions. These paleoceanographic records will also be used to document the frequency and amplitude of natural climatic variability in that region. Knowing the frequency of these oscillations might help to identify their causes and will contribute to the better knowledge of our climate system.

"New solid superacidic nano-catalysts have been recently developed in our Industrial Catalysis laboratory, Concordia University, by successfully encapsulating a liquid superacidic species, triflic acid, into a solid nano-sized matrix called silica nanoboxes. 

The present project whose funding is applied to NSERC, comprises two sections:

a)    )	Preparation of nano-structured catalysts by encapsulation of strong acidic or superacidic species into Al- and Si-nanoboxes, or introduction of metal or metal oxides into the same nanoboxes, or preparation of new bifunctional and hybrid catalysts in which these nanoboxes are the main catalyst components.

b)    )	Application of these nano-catalysts to three catalytic reactions of industrial interest:

1)    )	Production of bio-fuels (bio-diesels) and bio-additives to fuels from biomass: alkyl levulinates (ethyl and methyl levulinates) from cellulosic wastes (paper milling sludges, agricultural/forestry residues, wood residues).

2)    )	Ethylene and alkyl benzene from bio-ethanol.

3)    )	Preparation of novel nano-catalysts for the Thermocatalytic Cracking (TCC) for the production of ethylene and propylene, two important intermediates for plastics, synthetic fibers and other large-volume products for the petrochemical industry.

"Apr�s les gaz � effet de serre, les a�rosols sulfat�s repr�sentent le plus important facteur influen�ant le bilan radiatif de l'atmosph�re terrestre. En augmentant la densit� des noyaux de condensation de nuage, les �missions de soufre accroissent la r�flectivit� des nuages et refroidissent le climat. Les �missions oc�aniques du dim�thylsulfure (DMS) repr�sentent une source importante de ces a�rosols.

"The research programme is divided into two general   areas which, however, are interlinked through computation.   The colour of a  chemical compound actually provides a map of its detailed atomic structure through the field of Spectroscopy.  Electrons can be added or removed to generate new species with energies probed by the field of Electrochemistry. Much of our work is devoted to providing the theory which links these two fields. In this fashion, using both electrochemical and spectroscopic data, aided by computation, we can obtain a very detailed understanding of the  structure and reactivity of chemical compounds.  The publication of such linkages enables other researchers to similarly probe and design their own compounds.  The second area probes the chemistry   of a group of species called ""phthalocyanines"" using electrochemical, spectroscopic and computational techniques. The phthalocyanines are   synthetic pigments related to the pigment which causes the red colour of blood; however they are usually blue or green and do not occur in nature. They are of growing importance in the emerging field of molecular electronics, information storage and chemical sensors etc.

"The oomycetes are fungus-like organisms also called water moulds. Most species can produce zoospores that swim in water with two different flagella attached at the same point on the zoospore. Most species of the Peronosporomycetidae, the targeted subclass for this study out of the two found in oomycetes, are terrestrial species causing diseases of plants or growing on dead organic matter. The two main genera are Pythium and Phytophthora.  If enough free water is present, which is common in agricultural soil after heavy rain, the zoospores can actively swim towards the roots of a host by sensing changes in chemicals or electric charges. This directional movement is particularly noticeable if the roots are wounded. Interestingly, although several species of Pythium and particularly Phytophthora can only infect certain species, the zoospores do not seem to be able to sense if a host is suitable or not when they are swimming towards a root system. Many molecular studies have been dealing with the plant/pathogen interactions once the zoospore has reached the host since this is where many interesting gene for gene interactions occur leading to resistance or disease outcomes. However, few molecular studies have concentrated their efforts on the zoospore itself. Our laboratory has extensive expertise in taxonomy and molecular ecology of Pythium. We want to find unique genes involved in the flagellar apparatus, motility and behaviour of the zoospore and compared these gene sequences among Pythium species. We will turn off some of these genes in Pythium aphanidermatum and see their effect on zoospore. We have developed various tools to detect Pythium species in the environment but they cannot differentiate the kind of Pythium tissue being detected or if the pathogen is dormant or not. Once we have identified genes expressed exclusively in active zoospores or when the zoospores are being produced, we will be able to improve the systems we have developed by detecting RNA of active of zoospores and identifying the Pythium species from which the RNA was isolated, making it possible to predict accurately if a crop species is at risk or not.  This would be a significant improvement of our diagnostics system being used commercially.

"Microbiologists have traditionally focused on free-floating bacteria growing in lab cultures; yet they have recently come to realize that in the natural world more than 99% of all bacteria live in biofilm communities. As a result, biofilms research is now one of the hottest topics in microbiology. Biofilms are ubiquitous and can developed on virtually every natural and man-made surface. The cost to society associated with biofilms (e.g. equipment damage, product contamination) is estimated to range in the billions of dollars annually. Biofilms represent a protected mode of growth that allow cells to survive a wide range of environmental challenges. A number of factors have been considered to be responsible for this renowned tenacity of biofilms. Recently, it has been proposed that a genetically determined process of bacterial suicide can occur as a feature of the dynamics of some bacterial populations that encounter stresses. Most bacterial chromosomes contain a number of suicide or toxin genes that induce cell growth arrest or death. This research proposal raises the hypothesis that bacteria tightly regulate the expression of their suicide systems to foster survival of their progeny in the biofilm. By regulating their suicide systems under various stresses, a subpopulation of cells in the community dies to permit the survival of the population as a whole (altruism). Streptococcus mutans will be used as model as this bacterium depends on a biofilm lifestyle for its survival in its natural ecosystem. The toxic activity of its toxin will be demonstrated using a protein expression system and the mechanism of action of the toxin characterized. The gene expression profiling of the suicide system after exposure to several environmental stressors will be determined. Finally, reporter systems will be constructed to study the transcriptional activities in in vivo biofilms. These results will provide knowledge of the mechanisms that determine microbial self-destruction for a better understanding of death events occurring in biofouling of any surfaces susceptible to microbial contamination. From an applied perspective, the results of this study may lead to the development of novel strategies to control and exploit the biofilm phenomenon in industry and environment technology.

"This research concerns the reasoning that a robot would have to do to interact

properly with a world that is changing and incompletely known. Almost all of

the research in robotics today concerns basic level tasks such as dealing with

noisy sensors (like sonar), controlling manipulators (like robot arms), or

determining how to move without colliding into obstacles. Higher level

decisions, such as when a robot needs to move at all, in what order it should

tackle its jobs, or what it should try to do if something goes wrong, often

end up being pre-programmed in advance. The goal of the research here is to

investigate what it would take for a robot to be able to make such decisions

for itself, based on what it is trying to do, what it knows about its world,

what it has been able to find out using its sensors. To get these decisions to

come out of a general reasoning process, however, it will be necessary to

express in a language suitable for automated reasoning, enough of what the

agent needs to know about its world, goals, actions, ability, the cognitive

states of other agents, collaborative task execution, and so on. The research

proposed here would examine various aspects of these problems, and attempt to

develop high level agent controllers of this sort.

"Polymer Matrix Composite Materials (PMCM) offer a high stiffness / mass ratio. Their use in the transport

industry for the replacement of metallic components has steadily increased in the last decade. The principal

advantage of such replacement is the diminution of the vehicle mass which leads fuel economies. Since

environment and energy production will be planetary issues for the future years, efforts are required for

minimizing the energy required to perform a given task. Leading aerospace and aeronautics companies are

using PMCV for both structural and non-structural applications. Of particular interest are the components clos

to the engines where the service temperature can reach 550 F (288 C). At this temperature, PMCM are likely to

exhibit a viscoelastic behavior. These components will also be loaded in fatigue due to the landing - parking take

off cycles ofthe vehicle. In addition, the combined effects of high temperature and the environment near

the engines are likely to increase the ageing process ofthe polymer matrix. The designer of such components

has therefore many parameters to take into consideration and he requires efficient predictive tools in order to

optimize the component mass and to reduce the certification costs.

The principal objective of this collaborative project is to develop in collaboration with the industrial partners

novel methodologies for predicting the mechanical behavior of PMCM used at high temperature considering

static, fatigue and ageing effects. These methodologies will lead to new constitutive theories that will be

implemented into commercially available Finite Element (FE) packages used by the industrial partners

involved in this project. Validation of these models will be carried out on small scale structure components

supplied by the industrial partners. The PMCM studied here will be a polyimide matrix reinforced by a woven

or braided carbon fibers structure.

"Small businesses and entrepreneurial firms are essential for the long term competitiveness of Canada because they contribute significantly to the creation of employment. However, only half of new enterprises survive for 5 years, and by the end of a decade, only 20% are still in operation. It is therefore crucial to better understand decision making in new enterprise formation to increase the likelihood of firm survival. 



New venture decisions involve the assessment of business prospects, i.e. the decision to accept or reject a prospect. Business prospect assessment has become popular among prospective entrepreneurs, as new technologies are developing at an astonishing rate and technology transfer has been facilitated in numerous institutions. The objective of the proposed research is to better comprehend prospect assessment by improving our understanding of the underlying process of knowledge accumulation and the competitive forces that affect decision makers. For those prospects worth exploiting, the objective is also to examine how the shift from exploration to exploitation may determine a new enterprise's ability to realize a sustainable wealth creation. It follows that market entry strategies and the linking of these three inter-related decision processes - assessment, exploitation and entry, need to be investigated in order to obtain a fuller picture of new enterprise development.



This research will expose broader management communities of scholars to the use of mathematical models as a means to invigorate theoretical advancements in new enterprise development. Furthermore, greater understanding of how entrepreneurs can make better decisions, particularly in the hazardous early years, is likely to increase firm survival. Thus, entrepreneurs, providers of capital, and policy makers will also benefit from this research.

"An understanding of bacterial cell division and development is fundamental in controlling bacteria infecting plants, animals and humans. A major difficulty in these studies is that inactivation of these essential genes gives a lethal phenotype. One of the novel approaches that we use is based upon the genetics of small single-stranded RNA or DNA phages that produce small peptides blocking and inhibiting Mur enzymes in bacterial cell wall synthesis. We will identify how these small peptides behave as antibiotics and characterize new genes controlling cell wall biosynthesis.



The alarming increase and spread of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens is one of the most serious public health problems of the last decade. This critical situation necessitates the design of novel classes of antibacterial agents having new mechanism of action against novel targets. Nature could provide us with these new targets. Phages are viruses that are unique to and kill bacteria. Analysis of small phages and detailed studies of their unique lysis proteins will yield crucial information on how bacterial viruses inhibit and block bacterial cell wall synthesis. The study of the molecular mechanism of action of bacteriophage lysis proteins in a complete in vitro cell wall synthesis system developed by our laboratory is a relatively unexplored area. These studies will yield data and information about new mechanisms of action against novel antibacterial targets, namely the Mur cell wall biosynthesis proteins as well as small peptide antibiotics from phages.

"The ability to detect biologically active molecules is of crucial importance for fundamental studies in biochemistry, as well as applications ranging from bio-defense to drug development and point-of-care diagnostics.  Medical diagnostics often still rely upon labor-intensive, slow, and expensive bulk optics laboratory techniques.  The miniaturization of biological analysis systems promises to facilitate portable detection of common diseases and to greatly enhance our diagnostic abilities and reach.



In this research, we will develop novel optical nano-structures for high-sensitivity bio-sensing and combine them with miniature optical readout devices and flexible approaches for bio-sensing and bio-diagnostics. We focus on localization of a ""capture"" molecule (peptides, antibodies are typical examples) on a treated surface and optical detection.  Our optical bio-detection methods for the inspected molecules will rely on changing a local parameter such as absorption, index-of-refraction, or scattering.  The research progresses from electromagnetic theory and analytical device design to biological applications in 4 main stages: (1) design of optical nano-structures with analytic theory and numerical simulations; (2) fabrication of dielectric and hybrid dielectric/metal optical nano-structures using standard semiconductor fabrication tools (electron beam, optical lithography, etching); (3) evaluation of optical properties for the nano-structures and comparison to theoretical predictions; (4) demonstration  of bio-sensing utilizing these innovative designs within a ""lab-on-a-chip"" miniaturized sensor platform.

"The long-term objective of this research is to optimize continuous fermentation systems for direct fermentation of cellulosic biomass to biofuels (ethanol or H2) via consolidated bioprocessing (CBP). CBP is an alternative processing system in which cellulase production, substrate hydrolysis, and fermentation are accomplished in a single process step by microorganisms that express cellulolytic (and hemicellulolytic) enzymes, without (or with minimal) feedstock pre-treatment. CBP offers the potential for lower biofuel production costs due to simpler feedstock processing, lower energy inputs, and higher conversion efficiencies than current ""second generation"" cellulosic ethanol processes. Our model organism, Clostridium thermocellum, is a gram-positive, thermophilic, acetogenic, anaerobe that can utilize cellulose as a sole carbon source and synthesizes ethanol, acetate, and other organic acids via a mixed fermentation metabolism, with the concomitant release of hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Our experimental approach is to dissect the relationships between gene and gene product expression, end-product synthesis patterns, and the factors that regulate carbon and electron balance, within the context of the bioreactor conditions. To improve the rates and/or yields of ethanol or H2 synthesis via direct fermentation of cellulose, and to define continuous culture conditions that maximize synthesis of the desired end-product, a much more comprehensive understanding of these interactions is required. The short-term objectives of this proposal are to: 1) establish a continuous C. thermocellum culture system using a-cellulose as the carbon source; 2) evaluate the influence of substrate loading and HRT on bacterial growth, substrate conversion, and end-product synthesis patterns; 3) evaluate bacterial growth, substrate conversion, and end-product synthesis patterns using different cellulosic substrates (delignified wood fibers, agricultural by-products or residues); and 4) determine concentrations of key metabolic co-factors & electron mediators, and expression patterns of key genes and gene products in the pyruvate catabolism and H2 synthesis pathways of C. thermocellum during continuous cultured on selected cellulosic substrates.

"In recent years, the widely reported successes of revenue management (RM) in the airline and hotel industries and the expansion of online booking and retail sales systems have stimulated interest in RM and dynamic pricing (DyP) in many new areas. RM applications have been implemented or proposed in such diverse areas as freight transportation, automobile rental services, broadcast advertising, sports and entertainment event-management, style goods inventory clearance, medical services, real estate, and manufacturing. The rapid growth in internet sales channels and point-of-sale technologies has given many firms new capabilities for RM. Also, experienced consumers may now behave strategically by timing their purchases to anticipated periods of lower price. The difficult problem of price competition faced by firms operating in an oligopoly is made an order of magnitude more complex by the potential for strategic behaviour of consumers. The proposed project will help Canadian businesses to improve their RM capacity and remain competitive in the global economy.

The general objective of this work is to develop game-theoretic RM and DyP models and techniques to increase the efficiency and profitability of companies that are controlling and selling capacities of perishable inventories over time. A particular objective is to take different forms of competition into account and improve RM decisions for companies facing realistic conditions of competitor actions, incomplete information, and limited decision-making capabilities. An additional, related, objective is to understand how various market structures and complex consumer behaviours affect pricing and capacity decisions of competing companies and how these structures should be reflected in the design of RM systems. 



I intend to train two doctoral and five master's students in the area of RM and DyP. The doctoral students will be working on new theoretical aspects of RM and their practical applications. The master's students will obtain the expertise and technical backgrounds necessary for implementing existing RM models.

"Automated Visual Surveillance

The long-term goal of this research in visual surveillance is to study automated computer vision systems for monitoring 3D scenes and interpreting them to identify what is transpiring in time. To date, the automated surveillance literature has dealt largely with outdoor environments where people are viewed at a significant distance. By contrast, we will study close-up indoor live video scenes that contain an unknown number of people performing everyday activities, as well as inanimate objects that must be detected and recorded. We will concentrate on two new surveillance applications: (1) Monitoring which persons are viewing a computer screen after logon to prevent unauthorized viewing of personal data. (2) Monitoring people in confined spaces such as prison cells or patient rooms in an eldercare environment. Achieving these objectives requires the study of how to track and detect people as well as identifying the type of behaviors in which they are engaged. This research is concerned with accomplishing these tasks by means of classification.

"For the past 10 years, my laboratory has studied fundamental processes in music cognition from a number of different perspectives: psychophysics, neuroimaging, social psychology, development and special populations.  We've gathered basic information about memory for specific musical attributes, the neural correlates of musical structure and emotion processing, the relative independence of musical ability among the neurodevelopmentally impaired, the psychological space for musical preferences, and the interaction between vision and sound in the perception of musical performances.   So far, our work has been called innovative and cutting-edge by reviewers. 

     I believe that with what we know now, we are on the verge of being able to make truly large discoveries with far-reaching implications.  Construction on a new CFI laboratory was completed just last year, and we've moved into these new state-of-the-art facilities.  I've been able to recruit a talented group of students and post-doctoral fellows.  I seek funding to continue and expand our innovative research to address a truly important question: Why do humans have music? Related questions include: Where did music come from? Why does music have the effects that it does on so many people as opposed to other sounds? I propose to seek the answers to these questions by returning to the focused study of mental representations for pitch that began my career 15 years ago.  I plan a series of integrated and systematic studies on how people remember, encode, and categorize musical pitch, and the effects of musical experience.

     During the last two NSERC application cycles, my productivity has been in the Top 20% of researchers in my cohort, yet my funding awarded has been in the bottom 20%.  I am hoping that the present review will remedy this situation, and enable our lab to push forward and maximize our potential.

"This request is for the purchase of one pair of high-quality loudspeakers, with which we will conduct critical listening experiments.  My laboratory is a leader in the study of music perception and cognition, and nearly all of our experiments require human participants to listen to music and make perceptual judgments about it.  We have been using loudspeakers that are 20 years old (Westlake BBSM-10) and are no longer suitable for the type of high-fidelity, extended frequency range listening that our experiments require. Moreover, these loudspeakers were acquired when my laboratory had a listening room of a different size and shape for which they are no longer suitable.  

     My new laboratory at McGill features an acoustically isolated, dedicated listening room with a false floor, 8"" thick concrete block walls and a specially designed, quiet air conditioning system.  The background noise levels in this room are only 25 dB(A).  The room is approximately 225 square feet.

     With this proposal, I am requesting funds to purchase a pair of reference standard loudspeakers, B&W 802s, a reference standard pre-amplifier (Grace m904), and to contract a licensed acoustician to properly tune the room to the new speakers.

     The addition of these speakers will provide us with true reference, laboratory-standard listening conditions, and will dramatically improve our ability to collect rigorous and accurate data.

"Control theory involves user interaction to prescribe the behaviour of dynamical processes.  Control theory arises in almost all areas of engineering, with specific areas of application being robotics, guidance systems, spacecraft control, chemical processes, electric machines, to name but a few.  Moreover, control theoretic paradigms, particularly the ubiquitous concept of ""feedback,"" are sometimes useful in social sciences, biology, and medicine.



The research in this proposal is of a fundamental nature, directed at understanding the essential structural features of control systems.  Two basic properties in control theory are (1) controllability (can one state of the system be steered to another) and (2) stabilisability (can a specified state be made a stable operating point).  A significant portion of the research done in control theory touches, in one way or another, upon one or both of the properties of controllability or stabilisability.  Moreover, there is an enormous volume of basic research directed squarely at understanding these properties.  Despite this, for nonlinear systems, there is much that is not known about controllability and stabilisability.



In this research, the aspects of system structure that govern controllability and stabilisability are studied.  Moreover, the relationships between controllability and stabilisability are examined.  What makes this research unique is the particular techniques that are used to study system structure.  Specifically, the apparatus of so-called jet bundles is used to understand the local geometry of an important class of systems, so-called affine systems.  The techniques used will reveal aspects of the structure of these systems that are at present undeveloped.  An important feature of the work is its essential involvement of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, training scientists for the future.

"We will use methods from dynamical systems to explore the behaviour of mathematical models of differentially heated rotating fluid systems, as well as of systems from other areas such as neuroscience.  In so doing, we will develop a better understanding of the fundamental nature of these systems.  

     Specific objectives include analyzing a model for the differentially heated rotating fluid annulus experiment to gain insight into certain experimentally observed phenomena. Two examples are (1) the triple-point, which is a point in the space of control parameters that is shared by the boundaries of three dynamically distinct flow regimes, and (2) the vacillation flow pattern, which is a wave-like motion where the amplitude or wave structure appear to vary periodically in time. The triple-point will be investigated by quantitatively evaluating a strongly resonant Hopf bifurcation, while the nature of vacillation will be investigated by studying the secondary bifurcations that occur in the model.  Also, we will investigate the importance of the spatial extent of the dendrites in determining the behaviour of a neuron by studying the dynamics of a multi-compartment neuronal model near a codimension-3 degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation.

     The proposed research is important to the field of applied dynamical systems, because, among other reasons, (1) the bifurcations of codimension 2 and 3 that we will study, including degenerate and resonant bifurcations, and bifurcations with symmetry, are not only of inherent interest due to their fundamental role in characterizing the dynamics of a system, but are also of interest because they are being studied in the context of scientifically relevant models, and (2) the numerical approximations that must be made are challenging, some of which are at the limit of computational feasibility. The proposed research is also of direct scientific importance because the analysis will isolate the relevant nonlinear interactions that occur in the phenomena of interest, and thus will provide insight into the important mechanisms that lead to the observed behaviour.

"Suppose you take a rectangular sheet of paper and glue 1 pair of opposite sides together. The result is a cylinder. If you were to glue the other pair of opposite sides

together, and pretend the cylinder is now like a flexible tube,

the result would be to turn the cylinder into a torus (a donut without interior). If you were to apply the above procedure to a sheet of paper in the shape of a parallelogram,

and with perhaps a great deal of persistence, you would still end up with a torus. To a topologist, both tori are the same objects, but to an algebraic geometer, this is far from the case. Both tori are examples of elliptic curves (a curve here implies a 1-dimensional complex space, which is really a 2-dimensional real space). It is well known that an elliptic curve is the zero set (in a complex 2-space) of a degree 3 polynomial in 2 variables. The coefficients of that polynomial tell a story about the elliptic curve,

as well as the points in that zero set. A regulator in this context, is a machine that measures the complexity of the points on a given elliptic curve, and it is often given by a formula involving the logarithm of absolute values of points. Thus one can think of a regulator as a generalization of the logarithm. The points on an elliptic curve can be fashioned into a form of algebraic data called a Chow group. A vast generalization of this example situation involves higher Chow groups (algebraic K-theory) of algebraic varieties. The regulators in this context become arithmetic realizations of these Chow

groups, which in the end, reflect the arithmetic and geometry of an algebraic variety.

In summary, this research proposal concerns the construction of regulators on Chow groups, as a means of understanding the nature of algebraic varieties.

"Imagine the different sensations you perceive as you first touch a rough surface with a motionless fingertip, and then with back-and-forth movements at various speeds. These changes in perception can tell us about the dynamic properties of touch receptors in the skin, as well as those of the brain networks involved in somatosensory information processing. Such ""active sensing"" is used by a variety of sensory systems. Yet, in general, we know little about how movement of a sensory structure (like your finger tip or your eye) is coordinated with the dynamics of neural processing to optimize the acquisition of sensory information. My research focuses on active sensing and neural dynamics in the weakly electric knifefish. These fish are experts in sensory processing. They detect objects in their surroundings by monitoring minute changes in their self-generated electric field, despite high levels of natural interference, or noise. To do this, they probe their environment with stereotyped back-and-forth swimming movements, thus directly influencing the electrosensory signals encoded by the specialized electroreceptors on their skin. This proposal focuses on the role of motion in object detection and localization using electrosensory cues. Our approach is two-pronged, combining behavioural analyses and single neuron electrophysiology, in a multi-disciplinary setting. We will develop a novel system to create virtual electrosensory landscapes for testing object detection in behavioural studies. And we will use our recently developed neuron-computer interface to determine how network interactions influence motion processing by single neurons. The multidisciplinary training ground resulting from these diverse approaches will be ideal for students at all levels, preparing them for a range of careers in biotechnology and high-technology, as well as in academia.

"Emotion regulation can be defined as the control of attention, thought, and action impulses as well as regulation of emotional states themselves, and is thought to engage regions of the frontal cortex. Individual differences in personality style and in social functioning, as well as many forms of psychopathology, are associated with differences in emotion regulation. Between the ages of 3 and 7 years, children reach many milestones in the capacity for emotion regulation, but neural changes that accompany behavioural change are still not known. The goal of this study is to use a brain imaging method to capture individual differences in brain patterns subserving emotion regulation as they emerge in development. More specifically we wish to look at brain patterns associated with reactive and effortful control. Reactive control includes automatic attentional biases and control processes that are associated with automatic tendencies to approach or withdraw. Effortful control involves a wide range of  more voluntary strategies of emotion regulation. We hypothesize that differences in behavioural measures of temperament and self-control may predict or be predicted by patterns of brain activity. To study this process, we will present emotional faces to children while they are involved in a simple attentional task. Data will be collected at three time points: Just prior to beginning junior kindergarten (3 1/2-4 years), during senior kindergarten (5 years), and at the end of Grade 1 (6 1/2-7 years). Personality questionnaires filled out by parents and laboratory measures of behaviours associated with reactive and effortful control will be compared with patterns of cortical activation, both concurrently and over time. We thus hope to gain some understanding of the link between individual styles of emotion regulation and brain development over a key developmental time window. This understanding will be important for basic psychological knowledge, but it may also help psychologists learn how to identify neural patterns associated with behaviour problems before they become too entrenched.

"Prediction of the optical properties of the upper ocean is of central importance in oceanography.  These properties regulate the penetration of visible radiation with ramifications for both physical and biological oceanographic processes.  Solar radiation absorbed in the upper layers heats and stabilizes the ocean; as a result, variability in the rate of attenuation of visible radiation plays a strong role in the upper ocean thermal structure and dynamics.  Absorbed radiation is responsible for driving the photosynthetic process on which life in the sea depends.  For applied interests, the attenuation of visible wavelengths dictates the effective transmission from point and diffuse sources either at the sea surface, or at depth.  The goals of my research program are to examine both the sources of variability in ocean optical properties, and to evaluate the effect of this variability on both oceanic biogeochemical cycles and the physical climate interactions:

  1. Elucidation of the sources of variability in the optical properties of the ocean.  Sources include biological processes, fluid dynamical processes, non-living, but optically active ocean constituents (e.g. bubbles), and the physical properties of the radiance field as influenced by the atmosphere, the air-sea interface, and the net effects of radiative transfer within the ocean interior.

  2. Evaluation of the role of variability in oceanic optical properties in determining rates of primary production in the sea, particularly on scales appropriate for the determination of the role of oceanic biogeochemical processes in the global carbon cycle. 

  3. Evaluation of the role of variability in oceanic optical properties in determining the thermal structure and dynamics of the upper ocean.

  My approach includes theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, laboratory experiments, satellite observations and extensive sea-going field investigations.   The resulting increased skill in prediction will significantly influence our understanding of biological, physical and climate processes in the ocean.

"The focus of the planned research is on permafrost distribution and characteristics, and on associated landscape-forming processes. As an important component of the cryosphere and the only element that people live on year-round, permafrost is a critical part of the northern environment. Consequently, future permafrost change has been recognized as being one of the major consequences for the North of global warming.

The planned research program continues long-term investigations of permafrost conditions and dynamics in sub-Arctic and Arctic environments. Its four objectives focus on current conditions and the impacts of future environmental change: (1) refinement of models of the spatial distribution of mountain permafrost as a means to establish the current permafrost distribution and changes that can be expected as the climate warms; (2) analysis of the variability and dynamics of critical permafrost characteristics, including temperature, thickness and ground ice content, especially in areas where permafrost is thin and near 0�C; (3) examination of the impacts of current and future permafrost conditions on geomorphic processes, especially landslides and thermokarst (ground ice melt); and (4) development of methods to incorporate permafrost change into hazard susceptibility models for mountain areas. Fieldwork will be primarily in the mountains of the Yukon Territory and northern British Columbia, and in the lowlands of the Fosheim Peninsula, Ellesmere Island. Methods will include a combination of field data collection, physically-based modeling and GIS-based modeling at a variety of scales from the local to the regional.

The scientific significance of the planned research program lies in its investigation of fundamental relationships between air and ground climates which will be directly affected by environmental change, including the expected enhanced climate warming and precipitation changes of northern latitudes. In terms of societal importance, the results will be relevant to adaptation by northern communities, resource development, and infrastructure planning.

My students and I explore the evolution and development of animal body plans (polarity, germ lineage, sensory systems) using molecular and morphological techniques. Over the last 5 years we have developed a research program and a model system that now allow us to search for genes that are involved in the evolution of neural systems and study behaviour in-vitro using miniscule live sponges. With the sequencing of the first sponge genome there is now a wealth of genetic data to explore, which has attracted bright minds. My group has recently grown to 7 from 4; three of these students are every day seeking gene homologs and sequencing, and two are observing cellular changes live under the microscope. All of our subject animals hatch from tiny 'overwintering' cysts that the sponges form each fall, and which can be tricked to remaining in stasis by being kept at stable cold temperatures. Until recently we have struggled with refrigerators, and we have now learned after losing many batches of preciously collected specimens to warm temperatures that precisely controlled low temperature incubators are truly essential to the activity of our research.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Biological Sciences","Leys, Sally","EQPEQ ","Animal biology","Animal biology","Biologie animale",1-1

"Competitive multiagent systems are environments in which two or more self-interested agents interact. It is this ingredient of self-interest that makes a multiagent system ``competitive"": agents' desires cannot be relied upon to coincide.  Game theory is the dominant approach used to study such environments.  Unfortunately, a significant gap still exists between theory and practice.  For example, game-theoretic models are typically very small and are built on the assumptions that agents are omniscient (hold no false beliefs) and utility-maximizing (computationally-unbounded).  Even if such an agent did exist, existing theories would not tell him how to reason about more limited competitors.  Approaches to resource allocation usually assume that goods for sale cannot be resold and are unique (i.e., they are available only in the one-shot market being designed), that agents face no transaction costs or budgets, that markets can be redesigned without any constraints, and that agents know their valuations for the goods being allocated.  In practical settings of interest, some or even all of these assumptions can fail to hold.



I aim to join the researchers who are taking steps towards bridging this gap.  This task will not be accomplished easily or all at once: it is not for a lack of effort or insight that current theories have been unable to move beyond the restrictive assumptions mentioned above. However, past work has shown that it is often possible to make game-theoretic models better reflect practical domains when doing so is the explicit focus of the work. Furthermore, the computational approach offers promise: techniques like simulation, approximation and adaptation offer hope in settings where the analytical methods usually favoured by game theorists have fallen short.  Because of the fundamental importance of the research problem---both to computer science and to the economy---a research push in this direction is needed.

"This proposal seeks funding for a Raman spectrometer which will be utilized to develop environmental and biomedical sensors, optical and ferroelectric materials, gas-storage polymers and oxidation catalyst compounds.  Vapochromic and luminescent coordination polymers (Leznoff) and conjugated polymer thin-films (Leach) can sense volatile organic compounds and gases by colour/IR or conductivity changes respectively.  Modified, Leznoff's polymers can act as hydrogen-storage materials or as highly optically birefringent materials for optical telecommunications devices.  The Storr group is targeting bimetallic systems capable of mild and selective oxidative catalysis, a critical reaction in many organic syntheses.  Surface-enhanced Raman scattering of microarray biosensors (Yu) should greatly increase their sensitivity to key biological molecules (e.g. DNA).  Relaxor ferroelectrics (Ye) are integral to high energy-density capacitors, high-resolution ultrasonic medical imaging and new types of memory devices.  

For all new materials, basic structural and composition information are a critical first step prior to studying any potential applications. For many of our target materials, standard characterization analyses are uninformative. Raman spectroscopy, based on Raman light scattering, detects molecular vibrations and is complementary to the widely utilized infrared absorption spectroscopy (IR). Since the spectral acquisition rules are different, Raman spectra often show characteristic vibrational bands that are absent in IR.  Thus, Raman spectroscopy can be invaluable for materials characterization, especially since samples can be spatially resolved; for many of our materials, Raman should provide the fastest, most distinctive spectroscopic characterization information.

However, there is no infrastructure in the Chemistry Dept. at SFU to measure Raman spectra.  As our research urgently requires the ability to conduct this analysis, this grant requests a Raman spectrometer/microscope, an invaluable resource for materials chemistry researchers at SFU.  This instrument will permit key fundamental questions and applications that are currently out of reach regarding many new materials to be addressed.

The first goal of the proposed research is to devise program analyses that can be used in practical programming tools. Many program analyses have been determined to be efficient and precise in a theoretical setting under unrealistic assumptions. The proposed research will evaluate techniques that would enable these assumptions to be lifted, to make these program analyses applicable to mainstream programming languages and usable in real programming tools.



The second goal of the proposed research is to develop new program analyses for reasoning about the behaviour of individual objects and interactions between objects. Object-oriented programs are structured as collections of objects that work together to achieve the goal of the program. Understanding the functioning of the program requires understanding the communication between individual objects, and many programming errors can be prevented if the possibility of unintended object interactions can be detected before the program executes. The proposed program analyses will guide the programmer to points in the program that may cause objects to interact in undesirable ways.

"With the recent advances of network coding, data streams are divided into multiple segments, and each

segment is further divided into a number of blocks, which are then coded and transmitted over large-scale

networks. Since network coding is used, all coded blocks that belong to the same segment are equally useful,

creating a large quantity of the same ""commodity"" in the network. The more coded blocks that become

available in the network, the easier it is for a receiving node to reconstruct the segment. This improves the

degree of robustness in the network: one just needs to receive a sufficient number of coded blocks in a

segment, without noting its source.

This project explores the fundamental economic benefits of network coding with respect to its ""market power""

of equalizing the prices of data blocks. If network coding is not used, each sender, as a ""seller"" of data blocks

in the market, may have some ""rare"" blocks and some more common blocks that overlap with other sellers, and

""rarer"" blocks demand higher prices. With the help of network coding, blocks within the same segment are

equally useful and command the same price, and as such it is less likely for ""rare"" blocks to exist. Such rare

blocks are detrimental to the efficiency of content distribution and streaming in both wireless and peer-to-peer

networks, as nodes that have not yet received them need to wait till they become more widely available. In this

project, we seek to quantitatively study the market power of network coding on how it may equalize pricing of

data blocks as commodities in the market, and improve the efficiency of large-scale data distribution. We

consider the scenarios of both wireless and peer-to-peer overlay networks, and use tools from market theory

and game theory to facilitate our analysis. We seek to establish and support the claim that the most

fundamental benefit of network coding resides in its market power in large-scale networks.","Computer communications","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering, Edward S.

"The growing popularity of mobile devices that feature large colour LCD displays and computationally powerful processors has opened up new opportunities to support data streaming on such devices, from real-time stock quotes with low bit rates, to full-screen high-quality live multimedia. At the same time, the emergence of next-generation 4G wireless communication technologies have made it feasible to stream and playback multimedia content on smart devices with exceptional quality. Imagine the possibility of a sports fan watching a live show of her favorite game on her HTC Touch in the subway; a business analyst receiving real-time streaming quotes of major markets in the world on her Blackberry; or a university student reviewing a video podcast of his lectures using his iPhone in the library. This strategic project seeks to investigate the use of a powerful information theoretic technique, called network coding, in smart devices, with an objective of supporting the next generation of multimedia streaming applications. By taking full advantage of the power of network coding and mitigating its drawbacks, our solutions will be able to deliver information streams to smart devices on time, reliably, and cost-effectively.","Computer communications","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering, Edward S.

"Chemical industry represents one of the largest economies globally and plays a key role in producing critical living needs, disease fighting pharmaceuticals, energy needs of the world, essential materials for modern and the future needs of mankind.   Unfortunately, economic development in the past has come with the price of climate changes and environmental deterioration, which has caused serious social and health concerns.  The concept of green chemistry has fundamentally changed scientists' way of thinking in reconciling production, economy, and environmental issues philosophically by studying and creating new scientific foundations based on the principle of sustainability and efficiency. 

    The discovery of novel chemical reactions of high efficiency, high atom-economy and using water as an environmentally benign solvent by understanding the fundamentals of bond activations and bond formations in water will be the focus of this research program related to Green Chemistry. In the past several years, we have developed various Grignard-type C-C bond formations in water. More recently, we have developed Grignard-type C-C bond formations via transition-metal catalyzed reactivity of C-H bond in water. Such reactions offer the following advantages: (1) The reaction can be carried out conveniently without the need of excluding moisture and often, air as well; (2) Compounds with active functional groups such as carbohydrates and amino acids can be used directly without the necessary protection and deprotection steps associated with classical reactions based on organomagnesium and lithium reagents; (3) For reactions based on the reactivity of the C-H bond, it is not even necessary to synthesize organic halides, nor to use a stoichiometric amount of metals associated with classical organometallic reactions. The project proposes to continue our research efforts and to extend the scope of the C-C bond formation via the reactivity of C-H bonds in water and other benign media. The study will have a fundamental impact on organic synthesis and the environment in the 21st century and beyond. The projects will bring students to the frontier of green chemistry.

"Mobile ad hoc and wireless sensor networks have become a very active research area in the past few years due to their promising potential applications and involved research challenges. A mobile ad hoc network is a wireless network with no fixed infrastructure. Each node in the network operates in a self-organized and decentralized manner. Communication within the network can be established by the collaboration of a number of neighboring network nodes. Wireless sensor networks are a special category of ad hoc networks which are used to provide communication among densely deployed sensor nodes in a specific application region. Sensor nodes are tiny, autonomous devices which possess sensing, data processing, and communicating capabilities. As more and more small, cheap and power-efficient sensor devices become available, wireless sensor networks become increasingly attractive for applications such as environmental monitoring, health care, home security, industrial sensing and diagnostics, and data collection in battlefields or in harsh environments which are not accessible to human beings.

      Multicasting, an efficient method of delivering information to a group of destinations, plays an important role in many applications which require group communication capability. A scalable and reliable multicast support is an essential feature for many applications in ad hoc and sensor networks, such as emergency search and rescue, military communications, real-time data sensing, and emerging applications such as mobile TV and peer-to-peer communication for music and video sharing among personal digital assistant devices.

      The proposed research includes the development of novel and scalable algorithms and architectures to enable efficient group communication in mobile ad hoc and sensor networks. It is expected that the proposed research will play an important role in future unified multicast architecture as the trend of wire-line and wireless network convergence continues. This research will help solidify Canada's place in the forefront of communications technology.

"Many of the best-known results  in probability concern the asymptotic behavior of distributions; probability limit theory lies at the heart of probability and statistics. Probability limit theorems are concerned with rates of approximation of various observable processes by theoretically recognizable ones. For example, consider a random sample of n observations selected from a population with a finite variance. The central limit theorem states that, when the sample size n is sufficiently large, the sampling distribution of the sum of the n observations will be approximately normally distributed. Thus the central limit theorem allows us to make inferences on the mean of a distribution based on relatively large samples without having to know the exact form of the sampled population. There is a wide variety of statistical applications of probability limit theorems such as the analysis of large data sets, modelling traffic flow in communication networks, and providing a catalyst toward understanding and discussing the role of biostatistical research in relation to health services and decisions. The main focus of this research proposal will be on investigating the asymptotic behavior in statistical applications pertaining to hierarchical models, L-statistics, U-statistics, resampling methods, and the contemporary multivariate data analysis problems such as the largest entry of a sample correlation matrix, misspecified model, kernel estimator of the regression in a left truncation model, etc. A second focus relates to my long-standing research interest in almost sure and weak convergence of random processes, especially in the law of the iterated logarithm, the laws of large numbers, central limit theorems, probabilities of large or  moderate deviations, and precise asymptotics in the classical limit theorems for real-valued or Banach-space-valued random processes. The goal are to develop new methods for proving limit theorems and to investigate statistical applications of these theorems. This provides a beautiful interplay between the theory and applications of Statistics, Probability, and Stochastic Processes. The results related to this proposal will be novel and significant insofar as they will extend, generalize, and refine earlier work in the literature.

"A lab-on-a-chip (LOC) device is a microscale laboratory on a business-card-sized glass or plastic chip with a network of microchannels. Applying electrical fields along microchannels controls the liquid flow and other operations in the chip. These LOC devices can perform specialized functions as their room-sized counterparts, such as clinical diagnoses of bacteria infection and cancers. The key advantages include dramatically reduced sample and reagent consumption, high speed of analysis, automation and portability. Most biomedical analyses involve multiple biochemical and physical processes of molecules and cells in aqueous solutions.  A LOC device therefore must integrate the functions of different bench-top instruments into a single chip, and can perform multiple, sequential microfluidic processes required for realizing the assays on a chip.  In order to be able to systematically design LOC devices and control the chip operation precisely, one must understand the complicated microfluidic and nanofluidic phenomena and processes.

The objective of the proposed research program is to develop fundamental understanding of several key electrokinetic microfluidic phenomena. The proposed research program will study (1) how to control dielectrophoresis phenomena for separating and detecting different particles and cells. (2) induced charge electrokinetic flow phenomena to examine how to generate and control the vortices in microchannels for enhancing flow mixing and regulating flows. (3) how to control the electric potential at the microchannel walls by using mixtures of PDMS and metal nano-particles for controlling the electrokinetic flow. (4) particle electrokinetic microfluidic motion in microchannels with nano-gate to develop a microfluidic sensor for detecting nano-particles. 

The research results will provide important tools for the development of new LOC technologies and devices for applications in biomedical clinical diagnosis and food safety inspection. One PostDoc fellow, six Ph.D. students and two MSc. students and several undergraduate students will be trained in this research program.

"The world faces an energy shortage. Fortunately, the rapidly - expanding oil sands industry in Northern Alberta is playing an increasingly significant role in guaranteeing Canada's oil self-sufficiency for the present and foreseeable future. However, extraction and production of oil from the extremely abrasive material that constitutes this enormous resource, through open pit mining, hydrotransport and bitumen separation and upgrading, is affected very adversely by severe wear and combined wear and corrosion of components and equipment throughout the processing facilities, resulting in significantly high cost for repair and replacement of operation facilities as well as the lost production.



Development of effective wear-resistant materials is the core technology for mitigating wear problems. However, wear is basically an unsolvable problem that always exists as long as there is dynamic interfacial contact. Although significant efforts have been made to develop wear-resistant materials, wear still results in very high costs for operation and maintenance as well as accompanied lost production. Further improvement of current wear-resistant materials technology is very challenging, since it appears that we have reached the maximum capability for developing effective WR materials. Breakthrough seems unlikely based on the conventional methodologies.



The objective of this project is, in collaboration with the oil sands industry, to explore a novel type of material with pseudoelastic (PE) and negative thermal expansible (NTE) phases against abrasion, erosion and erosion-corrosion. Allowing for the fact that wear of materials is a common problem encountered in almost all industries, e.g., oil and gas, transportation and manufacturing, this research is of general significance not only

to the oil sands industry but also to many other industrial sectors.

"Elastomeric proteins are key elastic elements in a wide range of mechano-chemical machinery in cells, and can also function as structural materials of superb mechanical properties. Understanding the molecular design of elastomeric proteins is the key to understand the biophysical principles underlying various biological processes and to use these proteins as building blocks for the bottom-up construction of advanced materials and nanomechanical devices. We propose to combine single molecule atomic force microscopy with protein engineering, molecular dynamics simulations and traditional biophysical techniques to elucidate the physiochemical principles underlying the mechanical stability of proteins, and to develop rational methodologies to design proteins with well-defined and tunable mechanical properties. We will focus our studies on protein GB1, one of the successful model proteins we screened for single protein mechanics studies. We will use single molecule AFM to measure the mechanical properties of proteins at the single molecule level and use site-directed mutagenesis to dissect the mechanical unfolding/folding pathways and examine the roles of non-covalent interactions in determining the mechanical stability of proteins. Building upon our preliminary findings, we will develop novel methodologies to tune the mechanical stability of protein GB1 using protein-protein interactions and metal-ion binding. We will systematically investigate the effects of protein-protein interactions and metal-ion binding on the mechanical stability of protein GB1 and understand the molecule mechanism underlying such modulations for the mechanical stability of proteins. We will also further develop protein recombination method to engineer proteins with novel mechanical properties. These studies will lay the foundation for engineering artificial elastomeric proteins with well-defined and tunable mechanical properties, and pave the way to use artificial elastomeric proteins as components and building blocks for a variety of nanomechanical and material science applications.

"In the future, autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) need to work in teams with Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) to share information and coordinate activities. The private sector and government agencies have implemented UAVs and UGVs for homeland security, reconnaissance, surveillance, data collection, urban planning, and geomatics engineering. Significant research is in progress to support the decision-making process for a Multi-Agent System (MAS) consisting of multiple UGVs and UAVs. The proposed five-year research program will contribute to these efforts by investigating fundamental issues in intelligent control of (MASs, including cooperation, coordination, sensor fusion, collision-free navigation and teleoperation of multiple UGVs and UAVs. MASs with multiple UGVs and UAVs are typical distributed systems. We will use artificial intelligence approaches to develop intelligent control algorithms for the cooperation and coordination of autonomous vehicles. We will also develop technologies for sensor fusion and collision-free navigation because they are critical issues for systems in a dynamic and unknown environment. When using UGVs and UAVs in hazardous or unknown environments, it is often desirable for a human operator to be able to teleoperate the system. Therefore, we will develop teleoperation mechanisms for a team of UAVs and UGVs. Simulation technologies have become important to the development of aerospace vehicles. In this research, we will integrate a high-fidelity UAV model with mobile robots and networked computers as a test bed for the control of multiple UAVs and UGVs. The proposed MAS control technologies will improve the reliability and efficiency of the control of distributed systems. The results will have wide applications in both commercial sectors and the defence industry. Furthermore, the research will provide training for highly qualified personnel in the areas of intelligent systems, control theories, robotics and aerospace, which are highly demanded by Canadian employers.",Engineering,"Advancement of knowledge","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Li, Howard","RGPIN ","Intelligent systems applications",Robotics,Robotique,2-5
"Reconfigurable computing is intended to fill in the gap between hardware and software, potentially achieving a much higher performance than software, while maintaining a higher level of flexibility than hardware. By placing the computational-intense portions of an application onto the reconfigurable hardware, it will accelerate the system performance greatly. The implementations of cryptography services for IT (Information Technology) security on wireless devices and embedded systems present a great challenge, particularly to the memory, power, computation resources, and mobility constraints. Reconfigurable computing can serve as an excellent platform for hybrid cryptosystems on restricted computing environments and wireless devices. The reconfigurable architectures increase the flexibility of system schemes and the efficiency of computation resources, and reduce the total cost.  Moreover, hardware piracy issues cause  huge  profit loss in the  IT industry.  In this research project, we also examine how to use the reconfigurable computing/architecture to protect the hardware IP (Intellectual Property).  Image processing plays a crucial role in areas of medicine, crime prevention and investigation, publishing, entertainment, education, and scientific research.  It has become urgent to find the desired images from an image database quickly and automatically. This technique is known as content-based image retrieval (CBIR). However, little research has been done to use the reconfigurable computing technique to speed-up the image retrieval. We will explore new approaches of image retrieval and propose efficient algorithms and fast implementation to improve the retrieval rate of current CBIR systems. My research goal is to investigate and design reconfigurable architectures with low costs, high speeds, and high flexible structures to support real-time online secure data communications, hardware IP (Intellectual Property) protection, and image retrieval. The proposed reconfigurable architectures have regular structures and are very suitable for high speed VLSI implementation.  



The academic and technical achievements of this research program can be applied to many areas including but not limited to cable network services, electronic commerce, wireless network and devices, remote system access, smart cards, medical records, hardware privacy prevention, crime investigations, while providing high flexible scheme within the applications.

"There are thousands of industry-related facilities in Canada emitting or leaking significant amounts of petroleum hydrocarbons into the subsurface. The sites contaminated by such pollutants could pose serious environmental and health risks, and could also reduce land value and agricultural productivity. Consequently, the effective remediation and management of these contaminated sites have received increasing attentions from many environmental consultants, industries, communities, and governments. This research is designed to address various complexities arising from the optimal remediation of petroleum-contaminated sites through the development of advanced systems analysis and process control approaches. It includes a number of interrelated tasks: (a) to advance the R&D of 3-D numerical models for simulating representative petroleum-contaminated soil and groundwater remediation processes through an integrated experimental and mathematical modeling approach; (b) to develop advanced system optimization methodologies for taking into account nonlinearities, uncertainties, and multi-objective characteristics of site remediation system; (c) to develop innovative process control approaches for optimal site remediation by combining the remediation simulation and optimization models with various information and artificial intelligence technologies, and (d) to apply the developed methods to site remediation case in northern BC.  The proposed methodologies allow for systematic consideration of factors and complexities that are related to site remediation, and the development of systems analysis and process control approaches would represent a unique contribution to methodologies for site remediation engineering. By providing effective tools for supporting contaminated-site remediation, this study will be able to bring significant environmental, economic and social benefits to the country, and may lead to spin-off jobs/businesses as a consequence of successful implementation of the newly developed methodologies. In addition, the proposed research will help to attract and train a number of talented students, who will be capable of addressing Canada's future environmental challenges.","Modelling and mathematical simulation of natural processes",Environment,"Environmental Engineering","Li, Jianbing","RGPIN ","Environmental engineering","Environmental engineering","G�nie de l'environnement",2-5

"Understanding the mechanisms of ovarian follicular development and oocyte maturation may help to improve human and animal fertility. We have recently performed a set of preliminary experiments to study whether Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) may be involved in regulating ovarian function. Our data indicates that GDNF and its co-receptors, the ""rearranged during transformation"" (RET) tyrosine kinase receptor GDNF family receptor ?-1 (GFR?-1) are all expressed in both oocytes and granulosa cells during follicular development. We intend to further explore in what manner this growth factor regulate ovarian function. The long term goal of my NSERC discovery research program is to study the factors and mechanisms involved in the regulation of ovarian follicular development and oocyte maturation. The short term objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that GDNF regulates granulosa cell proliferation, differentiation and oocyte maturation during ovarian follicular development and that Bmi-1, a gene expression repressor, is essential in this regulation.  Cellular and molecular approaches will be utilized to address the following aims: 1. To study the role of GDNF on granulosa cell proliferation, differentiation and oocyte maturation during follicular development in vitro; 2.To identify the signaling pathway that is involved in GDNF regulation of oocyte and granulosa cell function; 3.To examine whether Bmi-1 plays a role in granulosa cell proliferation, differentiation and oocyte maturation during follicular development in vitro; 4. To elucidate whether GDNF and Bmi-1 cooperate to regulate ovarian function. 5.

"Newsprint manufacturers have in recent years been experiencing an extremely difficult time due to the challenges created by the popularity of electronic media and the continued increase of the electrical energy costs. To overcome the current challenges, newsprint manufacturers using thermomechanical pulp (TMP) are striving to improve their TMP processes to save production costs or to produce high value-added products.  

    The overall objective of this project is to develop innovative enzyme technologies for saving energy in the TMP process, which include developing bio-technologies for the TMP process and identifying and producing cost-effective and process-compatible enzymes. Two leading TMP mills in Atlantic Canada, Irving Paper Inc. (NB) and NewPage Corporation (NS), will be supporting and participating in this project.  In this project, we will use an innovative approach that will enable us to achieve our ultimate goals.   Specifically, we will focus on developing commercially applicable technologies; focus on the fundamentals of the enzyme actions on wood and fibre structure; and use leading-edge genomic and proteomic technologies to identify synergistic combinations of microbial proteins for bioprocessing wood chips.  

    Canada is one of the major newsprint manufacturers in the world.  The technologies to be developed will benefit not only the two participating companies, but also the other newsprint mills across the country. This project will attract and train several HQP's for the pulp and paper industry. This project will also help build a strong innovative research capacity in the participating institutes and industrial partners, which will be a vital force for this industry to sustain and to remain competitive in the global market.

"Inter-fibre bonding determines the network structure of fibres formed in paper thus determines basically all the paper properties, including structural, mechanical, optical, thermo and electrical properties of a paper sheet.  Many efforts have been made to establish methods for determining inter-fibre bonding.  However, the validity of these methods have been under various discussions.  The proposed research will develop totally new methods for inter-fibre bonding measurement by using AFM.  The greater advantages of the proposed method are that, not only the inter-fibre bonding, but also the surface chemistry as well as the nano-surface roughness of the bonded area, can be revealed.  It is expected that the results of this research will provide new understanding of the fundamentals of inter-fibre bonding.



Mechanical pulp has been used increasingly in various paper grades.  However, the low bonding ability sets a limit to the extent of its use in certain grades.  Low bonding ability may lead to higher surface roughness, and cause surface roughening, fibre rising, and linting in the printing process.  In order to increase the bonding strength, high alkali charge is used in the bleaching process, which increases the bonding strength but at the same time leads to bulk loss.



Canada is the world leader of market BCTMP manufacturing.  Canadian industry will benefit from the research by gaining new insights on how manufacturing processes can be improved to produce products with desirable qualities. The industry will also benefit from the training of HQP that will be supported by the research. Students will gain valuable research skills and problem-solving abilities that will benefit their future employment and contribute greatly to the Canadian economy.","Wood, wood products and paper","Manufacturing processes and products","Chemical Engineering","Li, Kecheng","RGPIN ",Manufacturing,"Industrial engineering","G�nie industriel",2-5

"Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting over three million Canadians.  The onset of osteoarthritis is believed to be associated with abnormal contact mechanics of articular cartilage, the thin layers of soft tissue that provide virtually friction-free gliding surfaces in a healthy joint such as knee and hip.  Joint reconstruction is often performed to partially recover the mechanical function of the joint with end-stage arthritis.  Advancement in joint mechanics will help uncover the mystery of arthritis and improve joint reconstruction.  Recent studies also highlight the role of advanced joint mechanics in early diagnosis of arthritis using measurements from the joint.  We will study joint mechanics by building a computer knee model that incorporates the most recent development in the mechanics of articular cartilage.

    We will build the model for bovine and cadaver knees to test the theory and computational procedures.  The model will be generated based on the true geometry imaged from the knee and precise structural properties obtained from the mechanical testing of articular cartilage.  We will particularly measure the site-specific cartilage thickness and collagen fibre orientation for the implementation of the computer model, because of their potential roles in cartilage degeneration leading to arthritis.  The model will be validated using bovine and cadaveric joint testing.  In parallel studies, the profiles of healthy and arthritic knees will be obtained from human subjects using clinically high resolution magnetic resonance imaging.  Computer simulations will be performed for these subjects to understand normal and degenerative mechanics of their knees.  We will attempt to relate joint mechanical functions to the precise structural and geometrical properties of articular cartilage.  The micro-mechanics of cells in cartilage will be investigated with the improved understanding at the tissue and joint levels.  When further working with rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons, our research outcome will eventually serve arthritis prevention and prediction, as well as patient-specific joint reconstruction.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering","Li, Leping","RGPIN ",Biomechanics,"Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",1-5
"Proteomics plays an increasingly important role in bioscience and biomedical research, such as in the discovery of potential protein biomarkers for disease diagnosis or prognosis.  However, current analytical techniques only detect a small portion of the proteome from a cell or tissue sample.  While the analysis of a partial proteome is sufficient for some biological applications, large scale biological studies, such as systems biology and disease biomarker discovery, require a comprehensive analysis of the proteome.  Thus the main objective of our research is to develop advanced mass spectrometric techniques for proteome analysis with an ultimate goal of analyzing the entire proteome of a cell or tissue at high speed, i.e., whole proteome profiling. 



To achieve our goal, we will develop analytical tools for high resolution protein fractionation, efficient protein digestion, multidimensional liquid chromatography separation of peptides, effective tandem mass spectrometric sequencing of peptides, and high confidence database search for protein identification.  We will apply each developing technique to real world samples, such as E. coli, yeast, human cell lines or tissue samples, to gauge its analytical performance and illustrate the practical utility of the method.  We will also investigate the operational mechanism of each method so to further optimize its analytical performance.  In the end, we will integrate these methods to develop an analytical platform that will enable whole proteome profiling with high efficiency and specificity.



The expected significance of this research includes the development of new mass spectrometric techniques and methods for comprehensive proteome profiling and the demonstration of these methods for whole proteome profiling of several types of important biological cells.  This research also allows the training of a number of highly skilled and highly sought-after analytical chemists.

"Fitting complex models with a limited number of observations is becoming increasingly necessary in various scientific and practical applications. For example, medical science faces challenges in developing disease predictive models using genetic screening tools, and economists must build a model for forecasting financial and economic indices. Traditional statistical methods fail to achieve required results due to the large number of variables involved. Standard methods must select a subset of data, ignoring the vast majority of variables, in order to manage information and achieve results. My research focuses on developing well-calibrated and computationally efficient statistical methodologies for such data sets. In my previous work, I have demonstrated mechanisms to manage large data sets (e.g. with thousands of variables) and constructed efficient software tools to implement Bayesian models to analyze such data sets. My current research will be directed towards developing more efficient Bayesian statistical methodologies and attempting to apply them to a wide variety of real problems.

"The proposed research will extend previous work on the environmental fate and transport of contaminants. The objectives will be: (1) To extend research on environmental mobility of heavy metals and availability. Key variables include soil characteristics, preferential sorption, partitioning, sorption kinetics and mechanism, distribution and desorption for different environmental conditions. Field and laboratory studies will be carried out. Bio-availability will also be examined. (2) To extend previous work on retention of heavy metals in various soils, conduct a major experimental study on clinoptilolite to explore its sorption efficiency and treatment capacity for ARD remediation in a three-phase fluidized bed. (3) To undertake a phytoremediation study for heavy metals involving phytostabilization of soils along highways to prevent migration of metals through soil which might contaminate streams and rivers. (4) To undertake a major experimental study to examine the environmental pathways and fate of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) - flame retardants added to a wide variety of products such as plastic components of computers and televisions, circuit boards, upholstery, and textiles.

     Environmental mobility of contaminants is the major property determining the extent and migration of pollutants in soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment. These are challenging issues in industrialized countries. The proposed work will address a number of issues that have not been resolved adequately. It will be directed towards novel treatment methods. The data will be useful for regulators, engineers and practitioners involved in contaminated site issues and will provide guidance for rational design of proper containment, remediation and treatment systems. Hence they will help prevent pollution of water resources. The overall significance is to provide better scientific understanding of the fate and environmental mobility of contaminants, while identifying and solving major environmental problems.","Pollutants and toxic agents (waste, use 902)",Environment,"Civil Engineering","Li, Loretta","RGPIN ","Geotechnical engineering (including engineering geology)","Civil engineering","G�nie civil",3-5

"Finite mixture models are widely applied to data sets in which several homogeneous populations are mixed together. In financial economics, mixtures of three normal distributions are often applied to daily stock returns due to the existence of three risk regimes: low, normal and high. The number of homogeneous populations in a finite mixture is of great interest in applications. For example in statistical genetics, this number reflects the number of major genes in action.  In the first project, a novel and practically convenient method, called the EM-test, will be developed for testing the number of homogeneous populations in a finite mixture.



Finite mixture models can be directly applied to cluster analysis, whose purpose is to segregate the data into homogeneous populations. In cluster analysis, it is important to know the number of homogeneous populations and important features for the segregation. In the second project, a criterion, which can be used to determine the number of homogenous populations and choose the important features simultaneously, will be proposed for categorical data. 



Switching regression models are often used to explore the relationship between a response and one or more explanatory variables when several homogeneous populations are mixed together. In the third project, testing the number of homogeneous populations by using the idea of EM-test and fitting the regression model for each homogeneous population will be explored in switching regression models. 



For each project, the user-friendly software will be developed. The success of this research program will lead to fundamental contributions to the methodologies and theory of finite mixture models. It will also prompt the application of finite mixture models in many fields in the natural sciences and engineering.

"This multi-user application is for an ambulatory miniature inertial sensor-based motion analysis system. This device will allow for the expansion of the existing research in Motion Analysis at the Human Mobility Research Centre (HMRC) and is essential for establishing Dr. Li's research program on energy efficient wearable lower-limb robotic devices at Queen's University. The Xsens system is a camera-less system and is capable of measuring 3D kinematics in a daily living environment; therefore this system will allow the research to go beyond the restrictions of a lab setting.



Walking, while easily accomplished by a healthy individual, is often a difficult task for the elderly or physically impaired. With our elderly population increasing, there is a growing demand for assistive devices to improve their quality of life. Dr. Li's proposed research seeks to develop un-tethered, energy efficient, wearable lower-limb robotic devices to assist walking in everyday life. His research will incorporate a previously developed energy harvesting technology with robotic power assistance to develop energy efficient robotic devices. The first aim is to design a wearable knee robotic device that is capable of assisting knee motion in one portion of a gait cycle and harvesting energy in the other portions of the gait cycle. The second aim is to develop a bi-articular wearable robotic device with a knee joint and a hip joint to allow energy exchange between these two joints. The third aim is to develop real time walking speed and terrain estimation methods for wearable robot intelligent control using wearable sensors. The requested equipment is essential for his research program.  The requested equipment will complement a CFI infrastructure grant application of a Bio-Mechantronics and Rehabilitation Laboratory, and consequently increase the impact of CFI and NSERC investments. This equipment will support graduate student training in Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Physiotherapy, and Kinesiology as well as clinician-scientists, residents and fellows in Orthopaedics.

"This proposed research has two components: The first component is the investigation of the movement of a sediment mixture in natural rivers. The movement of loose riverbed sediments varies with time and space. It frequently leads to channel erosion/sedimentation, increase of river flood risk, and destruction of fish habitat. The second component is the investigation of counter-flowing, layered fluid exchange in connecting sea straits and channels. Exchange flow can carry oxygen, nutrients and pollutants into or out of a harbour, a lake or a coastal region. Therefore, exchange flow has important water-quality and ecological implications.

    In Canada, many important issues related to rivers and coastal waters such as flood protection for human settlements and land, fish habitat restoration and water pollution control are facing decision makers and the public. This proposed research will provide scientific input so as to address these issues in a sound manner. Both the problem of channel erosion/sedimentation and the problem of unsteady exchange flow are long standing problems in the field of Hydrotechnical Engineering. This research will lead to improved understanding of the relationship between sediment movement and channel change as well as improved understanding of the role of relevant factors in exchange flow.

    More importantly, this research will build our ability to predict spatially varied sediment load and the rate of unsteady exchange flow. New prediction methods and reliable computational tools of practical importance for river and channel applications are expected to be developed. The applicant believes that exciting results will emerge from this research through comparisons between predictions and field observations from real rivers and channels in Canada. Such results and prediction tools will be useful for the integrated aquatic management of rivers, estuaries and coastal waters.

"Across virtually all industries and geographic regions, manufacturers share one common goal: to increase profitability by decreasing costs.  To significantly reduce their overall costs, many firms have contracted with suppliers located in much lower-cost countries to help them access a large pool of workers at a fraction of the cost of similar domestic facilities.  While the allure of dramatic savings is undeniable and the use of offshore facilities is virtually unavoidable, risks involved in offshoring/outsourcing are significant. Among all, the greatest risk is the expectations about how much the savings from offshoring will be.  A typical example of hidden costs is the impact of currency revaluation, which can have a dramatic effect on the success of offshoring endeavors.  In addition, a lot of unexpected and sudden events such as terrorist strikes, political instability and natural disasters have awakened managers as never before to find ways to mitigate outsourcing risks.  In this research program, we will investigate the inverse relationship between the risks and cost efficiency.  Our research is divided into two phases in the next five years.  In the first phase, we focus on coping with uncertainties in exchange rates and product demand and the objective is to study how strategic capacity planning as well as operational and financial hedging can mitigate the risks related to demand and exchange rates.  Theoretical results are expected to be derived to explain the effect of operational and financial hedging.  In the second phase, we will extend the research in the first phase from two-stage problems to multi-stage problems to incorporate the dynamics in the uncertainty of demand and exchange rate.  The objective is to propose an optimal long-term capacity portfolio.  In addition, rare events such as natural disasters and political events in the low-cost countries where suppliers are located will also be considered.  Scenario-based large-scale stochastic dynamic programming models will be developed.  The combination of analytical and optimization models will provide complementary results in understanding the importance of capacity planning and the roles of operational and financial hedging in short- and long-terms.","Production and operations management","Manufacturing processes and products","Management, Desautels Faculty of","Li, Shanling","RGPIN ","Operations management","Industrial engineering","G�nie industriel",1-5

"One major challenge in large-scale engineering design stems from the coupling effect among design sub-problems that are handled by different teams.  For instance, in automobile design, design decisions from a chassis team can affect design decisions from a suspension team and vice versa.  Situations become even worse when one team unintentionally makes design decisions that will deteriorate the design performance of another team.  Facing this challenge, this research program intends to propose a computational team approach that streamlines the decomposition and coordination activities to formally address large-scale design problems.  This streamlined process should facilitate different teams to work synergistically for optimal design results.



From this research, current coordination practice in engineering design can be shifted from an ad-hoc manner to a systematic approach.  This shift can facilitate the cooperation of teams to produce overall design results reliably and efficiently.  Then, the results from this research can assist a company in producing more fascinating products in a multidisciplinary, distributed design environment.  Ultimately, the development of computer software that guides team design activities becomes possible to benefit large engineering companies.",Engineering,"Advancement of knowledge","Mechanical and Industrial Engineering","Li, Simon","RGPIN ","Engineering design","Design and manufacturing","Conception et fabrication",3-3
"In recent years, the actuaries' problem regarding mortality assumptions is that people are living longer than expected. This problem has resulted in unforeseen mortality losses in annuity liabilities. The industry now demands better stochastic mortality models for forecasting future mortality, and more developed mortality-linked securities, which can help them manage longevity risks at a reasonably low cost. 



In this project, the investigator will develop stochastic mortality models with better measurements of the underlying uncertainty and the year of birth effect, which is believed to be one of the reasons for underestimating mortality reduction. The investigator will then combine the mortality models with financial engineering tools to price various types of mortality-linked securities that can be used for hedging longevity risks.



Longevity risks affect not only traditional insurance products, but also more sophisticated guarantees that are offered in reverse mortgages and insurance products that have more of an investment focus. These newer products are becoming increasingly popular in Canada. The need for developing risk management techniques for these products is pressing. In this project, the investigator will investigate how to quantify and manage the longevity risk associated with these products.

"Fuel cells have emerged as a promising candidate for terrestrial power generation because of their high-energy

efficiency, environmental friendliness and compatibility with alternative fuels and renewable energy

sources/carriers for sustainable development, and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell is particularly

suited for transportation and on-site co-generation applications due to its high power density and fast startup.

The key technical barriers to the commercialization of PEM fuel cell is the cost reduction and performance

improvement, including reliability and durability. However, performance improvement and cost reduction are

critically hindered by the difficulties associated with water and heat management in PEM fuel cell. Water and

heat management are interrelated due to the non-uniform temperature distribution and water phase change, and

are known as the two critical issues that limit the performance and cost of PEM fuel cells.

Therefore, the objective of this proposed research is to improve the understanding of water and heat transport,

and then to develop effective water and heat management strategies through the improved understanding that

can be implemented in the design and operation of PEM fuel cell for cost reduction and performance

enhancement. To achieve the above objectives a collaborative modeling and experimental investigation is

planned, involving the design, fabrication and testing of PEM fuel cells, and the use of a state-of-the-art

neutron radiography facility, powered by a nuclear reactor, at the US National Institute of Standards and

Technology (NIST). The applicant and the researchers at the supporting organization (DaimlerChrysler) and

NIST have already had collaboration in their existing research activities, and have complementary expertise

and skills with already available research infrastructure to carry out the proposed project successfully. The

results of the proposed research project will be useful to relevant Canadian industry in their effort to

commercialize PEM fuel cell with competitive cost and high performance.","Energy storage and conversion","Energy resources","Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics","Li, Xianguo","STPGP ","Fuel and energy technology (economic geology, use 4003)","Fuel and energy technology","Combustibles et technologie de l'�nergie",3-3

Combustion of fossil fuels provides the majority of the world energy needs. Liquid fuel atomization and spray is extensively used for fuel preparation before the combustion stage. Atomization quality and spray characteristics have significant impact on combustion efficiency and pollutant emission. However, the widespread use of fossil fuels results in environmental degradation and health hazards. Fuel cells, on the other hand, are efficient, clean and compatible with alternative fuels and renewable energy sources and carriers for sustainable development. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) using hydrogen as fuel are most promising for portable, mobile and on-site co-generation applications, while direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are PEMFCs with methanol as fuel. This proposed study focuses on (i) the liquid fuel atomization processes and spray characteristics as they relate to diesel engines using biofuels such as biodiesel, and (ii) transport phenomena in, and their impact on the performance of, PEMFCs and DMFCs. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a predictive spray model that can be used for performance prediction and cost-effective design of practical spray combustion systems; and to improve the performance and reduce the cost of PEMFCs and DMFCs. The results of the proposed study are (i) expected to be useful in formulating realistic spray models, and will be helpful in evaluating performance of spray combustion systems, thereby developing methods to improve combustion efficiency, to lower pollutant emissions, and to reduce the time required for the development of such spray combustion systems; and (ii) expected to be useful in fuel cell performance improvement and cost reduction, hence contributing to the commercialization of fuel cells for clean power generation.

"Our research team works toward better understanding of the ability of plants to fight against pathogen infections (termed plant immunity). Research in this field will enable us to design sustainable and environmentally more friendly ways to control crop failures caused by plant diseases. During the past few years, our group has made pioneering discoveries in determining the essential roles of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, protein modification and RNA processing in plant immunity. 

     We routinely carry out microbial infection experiments on plants grown in a growth chamber, so the conditions of each experiment can be tightly monitored and controlled. During the past nine years at UBC, the small growth chamber we acquired using my first NSERC-Equipment fund enabled us to propagate plant pathogens and conduct infection experiments properly, which is essential for the characterization of many novel mutants we identified that are defective in plant disease resistance signaling. Unfortunately, as a result of its constant use under a high humidity regime, the chamber is not functioning as reliably as in the past and it now requires frequent repairs. Many times students have to redo their experiments because of a chamber breakdown or malfunction that affects the infection process. In addition, our lab has expanded from having only two graduate students in 2002 to five graduate students and two postdoctors at the moment. Everyone has to share (sometimes fight for) the very limited space in the growth chamber, which can only hold three flats of plants, to conduct infection experiments that are regularly performed for each research project. We desperately, urgently need funding to purchase a new growth chamber with more space and adjustable lighting and humidity. The proposed Percival growth chamber, which can hold a maximum 21 flats of plants, will not only solve the immediate shortage on growth space for plant infection experiments, it will also improve the growth conditions for the plants so the data from the infection experiments will be more consistent and reliable. This will have a direct positive impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of our experiments.

"One of the major factors contributing to loss of crop yield and quality are diseases caused by microbial pathogens such as fungi, bacteria and viruses. Every year, farmers around the world spend billions of dollars on pesticides to save their crops, even though most chemicals are environmentally unfriendly and may generate pesticide-resistant pathogens. More and more attempts are being made to look for alternative control methods that are more sustainable and environmentally safe. One strategy is to utilize the defense mechanisms plants naturally use to fight against pathogens. To accomplish this, scientists all over the globe are teaming up to study the underlying general defense mechanisms (so called innate immunity) of plants, although much is left to be revealed. 

    The goal of my research program is to understand the innate immunity of plants against a broad-spectrum of pathogens. During the past few years, our group has made extensive progress in determining the essential roles of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, protein modification and RNA processing in plant innate immunity. We have discovered a number of regulators critical for plants to confer resistance to pathogens. Future efforts will be made to further dissect these novel resistance pathways and elucidate how all components work together to fight against pathogen attack. The proposed research will not only enrich our knowledge on how plants defend themselves against pests, but it will also provide hints about how to design novel strategies to protect the crops in our fields. 

    Finally, mammalian innate immunity has been shown to share remarkable similarity to plant disease resistance mechanisms. Some regulators we discovered that are essential for plant innate immunity have close homologs in mammals whose functions are unknown. Our proposed studies to reveal the biochemical functions of these proteins will shed light on how these proteins function in animals. Thus our proposed research may also have potential health benefits to human society.

"The tremendous growth in broadband access services has propelled photonics technology to a new frontier where fiber-based solutions enable not only converged voice, data, and video applications, but also a range of value-added services in local access networks. As a fast-emerging technology that utilizes the vast bandwidth available in optical fibers, these fiber-based access solutions, known as fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) networks, will revolutionize the entire global information network for reaching residential homes and business premises. A major barrier to the widespread deployment of FTTH technology, however, has been the cost. The objective of this proposed research program is to develop cost-effective single longitudinal mode (SLM) semiconductor laser diodes for optical network units (ONUs) in FTTH networks. The program will focus on the investigation of the alternative methods to control the lasing mode in semiconductor lasers with no grating involved. The main idea of achieving the SLM operation is to insert a passive band-pass filter at the rear end of the conventional Fabri-Perot (FP) cavity through etching. It is well known that the total internal reflection (TIR) may happen at a slanted trench introduced across the waveguide. Once we put two such trenches in parallel, tunnelling happens at a set of particular wavelengths at which the reflected waves through the two TIR interfaces cancel out. Therefore, within our interested wavelength range, the slanted double trench structure shows a band-pass filter feature with its spectral peak positions and pass-band width all controlled by its geometrical dimensions. By further aligning the pass-band with one of the targeted FP cavity modes, we achieve the SLM operation. With enhanced immunity of the laser performance from the external feedback and with increased yield, the new design targets a substantial reduction of the fabrication cost of such laser diodes for ONUs which typically account for 70-80% of the cost of a FTTH network. The proposed research, if successful, will therefore have significant impact on the development of the key components of FTTH networks.","Communications technologies (satellites, radar, etc.)","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Li, Xun","RGPIN ","Photon devices","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",2-5

"The threat of bioterrorism and the emergence of new pathogenic species and strains that are resistant to traditional treatments are amongst the most pressing health concerns of our time. The bird flu virus epidemic and the outbreak of Escherichia coli and Salmonella-contaminated lettuce in North America are the latest examples to drive this point home. These outbreaks can be a huge economic burden and, more importantly, pose a tremendous risk to human health. Early and accurate detection and identification of dangerous pathogens is a crucial step in preventing large-scale outbreaks. This is particularly relevant today as globalization of commerce and decreased travel times have significantly increased the rate and breadth of the spread of infectious agents. Traditional microbial pathogen detection techniques require large pathogen concentrations and/or long analysis times - time that can be very precious when assessing a patient with a deteriorating condition or when trying to identify and control a large-scale outbreak. Hence there is still a significant need to develop rapid, sensitive, accurate and inexpensive methods and devices for the detection of many known pathogens. Equally important is the need for a reliable method that can be put in place quickly to create new sensors and assays to respond to unanticipated outbreaks. The goal of this Strategic Project is to develop a method based on nucleic acid aptamers and enzymes that can provide high amplification of a selective binding event between the nucleic acid and the pathogen to allow detection of very low levels of pathogens in minutes. The proposal brings together three co-applicants with expertise in 1) DNA aptamer and DNA enzyme technology; 2) bioanalytical chemistry and biosensors and; 3) engineering of label-free fiber optic sensing technologies. Together, this team will develop and validate a new sensing platform based on room temperature amplification of DNA templates that are released upon binding of pathogens to functional nucleic acids on the sensor surface. The development of such sensors will create new intellectual property that can be licensed by our Canadian partner for eventual commercialization.","Medical equipment and apparatus","Manufacturing processes and products","Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences","Li, Yingfu","STPGP ","Nucleic acids",Biochemistry,Biochimie,3-3
"Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are widely known as the hereditary material for the storage and transmission of genetic information in all living organisms on earth. Since early 1980s, nucleic acids have been shown to have other talents as well, which include the ability to perform intriguing functions such as catalysis and binding. The existence of a large array of natural and artificial functional nucleic acids has generated tremendous enthusiasm in the scientific community for investigating fundamental properties of functional nucleic acids and for exploring them for novel applications in diverse fields including chemistry, biology, materials science, and nanotechnology. Our research program is interested in studying three different classes of functional nucleic acids: DNAzymes, aptamers and riboswitches. DNAzymes are man-made single-stranded DNA molecules that can act as catalysts. Aptamers are man-made single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that are capable of binding to other molecules, such as proteins and metabolites. Riboswitches are natural RNA sequences that are used by cells to detect a specific metabolite so that they can make decisions as to whether they need to produce more of this metabolite or slow down its production. This NSERC Discovery Grant aims to create new concepts and develop new approaches that explore DNAzymes, aptamers and riboswitches as chemical and biological tools. For example, we will work on the design of various 'beacons' at molecular level for the detection of specific molecules both inside and outside of cells. We will also use model functional nucleic acids to address fundamental questions about biological catalysis and molecular recognition. This grant will allow my lab to continue to make important discoveries in the arena of functional nucleic acids and to train several highly skilled graduate students over the next five years.

A ring is an algebraic system satisfying  certain axioms. The group ring of a group G over a commutative ring K is the ring KG of all formal finite sums, and is an attractive object of study. Here group theory, ring theory, commutative algebra and number theory come together in a fruitful way. 



My recent research work has thrown light on the algebraic structures of group rings and their unit groups, and has important applications in coding theory and combinatorial number theory. This will continue to be the main stream of my research program for the next 5 years. I will study several open problems and conjectures in group rings, including  the normalizer problem -- a long standing research problem, and the first Zassenhaus Conjecture. While much of my recent work is in group rings, I am also involved in some other areas including module theory. Most recently, I have started research in a new exciting area. Dr. Gao and I are able to use group rings as a tool to investigate some problems in combinatorial number theory such as Davenport's constant and the more general zero-sum problems.

"This research is aimed at modeling and analyzing biological mechanisms that generate oscillations, waves and other interesting patterns. Hormone secreting neurons and cells are the main focus of this research. Hormones are chemicals that are highly potent in low quantity that control almost all aspects of life. The blood level of a hormone typically exhibits a variety of rhythms. Hypothalamus in the brain is the center of origin of most hormonal rhythms. To understand hypothalamic rhythmogenesis, we need to understand many aspects of hypothalamic neurons, ranging from electrical membrane activities to signaling of second messengers including calcium and other chemicals. The best known example is gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) that is released in pulses with a period of about one hour. This signal is necessary for maintaining normal reproductive functions in both male and female. The absence or abnormality of this rhythm underlies multiple reproductive and developmental diseases. This investigator's whole research career has been centered around and motivated by this system. Important progress has been made recently in understanding the mechanism of the GnRH pulse generator. It motivated us to develop mathematical models of this pulse generator. This system and some related systems will be the main focus of this proposed research.



This research involves (1) collecting experimental data on the systems of interest; (2) developing mathematical models that focus on the key mechanisms; (3) analyzing the models with analytical and computational methods; (4) testing the models against known data and using them to gain new knowledge and predict new experiments; (5) applying the newly gained knowledge to other systems exhibiting similar phenomenon. Equations that describe the dynamics of these systems are typically  nonlinear ordinary, partial and integral differential equations. New mathematical knowledge often emerges in the study of these nonlinear systems.

"Distributed Generation (DG) is becoming an attractive approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to improve power system efficiency, and to relieve stress on power transmission and delivery infrastructure. From 2002 to 2006, the DG share of new electricity generation output has increased from 13% to 25%. In recent years, power electronic interfaced DG systems based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES) such as fuel cells, photovoltaic cells and wind turbines have experienced a large development worldwide. The microgrid is a more recent concept of systematic organization of these DG systems for higher efficiency, more capacity and control flexibilities. A microgrid can operate in grid-connected mode or islanding mode and benefits both the utility and customers in terms of efficiency, reliability and power quality.



However the RES based DG/microgrid presents a challenging picture in terms of connecting energy (from wind, sun etc.) to the grid, where the power electronic technology plays a vital role. With today's increased penetration of DG, the power electronic interfaces are subject to the demanding requirements related to the RES characteristics, the energy storage system, the distribution system configuration, power quality and the proper power system operation, etc. 



The main objectives of this research program are to develop suitable converter technologies and advanced control schemes and to provide timely solutions to the demanding requirements of DG/microgrid's power electronic interfaces. The proposed program will provide valuable training of highly qualified personnel. It will deliver necessary technologies and management strategies for rapid and constructive deployment of DG/microgrids, which will lead to the creation of high-technology jobs in the power industry as well as many other industries and contribute to Canada's continued economic success in a competitive global market.

"Much of the current turmoil in financial markets can be traced to a poor understanding of the  effect of uncertainty for the decision process. The ability to make optimal decisions (e.g., minimizing catastrophic loss) in the presence of a stochastic process, with uncertain model parameters, is a clear requirement for many operations, including institutions operating in the capital markets.



One of the main objectives of the proposed research is to develop new computational methods to efficiently offer robust solutions for high dimensional multi-stage optimal decisions under uncertainty. Such problems are known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality; it is often impossible to solve a problem with many random factors. In addition, the presence of even simple stochastic constraints makes solving these problems very difficult. We will use our previous research results in stochastic optimization and methods for handling constraints in deterministic optimization problems to develop new algorithms for constrained  multi-stage  stochastic optimization. Furthermore, we will investigate efficient implementation of the proposed algorithms in suitable parallel computing platforms.  Success of such research will be beneficial for many practical areas.



In addition to study of algorithms, we will also focus our research on financial applications. Specifically, the tremendous growth in equity trading has generated a renewed interest in the measurement and management of  execution costs, which can have a substantial impact on investment performance. We will determine the optimal dynamic execution strategy under more complex but realistic models and  assess the resulting  performance enhancement. In addition, methods for stable model calibration will be further developed.

"The past decade has witnessed the proliferation of Internet applications. The most significant category of them, when measured in traffic volume, is data dissemination, accounting for over 70% of today's Internet data flows. These include applications such as the distribution of software patches, peer-to-peer transmission of movie files, the streaming of stored or live media, video conferencing and online group gaming. They share the common property that digital information, often in large volume, is requested by and delivered across the Internet to multiple users. Such applications are modelled as multicast in the networking community. Substantial research effort has been devoted to understanding the underlying structure of information multicast, creating mathematical models for it, and designing effective algorithms that optimize its performance. To date, most multicast algorithms assume a cooperative network environment with honest, cooperative and altruistic agents. However, such assumptions are not always safe in practice;  and when they are not, the network performance may deteriorate dramatically. We study how new multicast algorithms can be combined with economic measures to enforce desired behaviours on selfish agents in the Internet, by jointly investigating information coding, data flow routing, and selfish agent control. Latest developments on network coding will be incorporated for an amenable algorithmic structure of the multicast routing problem. Optimal routing algorithm models will then be designed, both to reduce the total cost shared by selfish users, and to provide a concrete ground in which cost sharing schemes may be developed. Incentive engineering mechanisms for noncooperative game design will be studied, to ensure the solution is stable even if agents in the network value their own utilities more than the overall well-being of the Internet. This research program represents one of the earliest attempts in optimizing data dissemination with selfish behaviours in different components of the Internet explicitly addressed, with a goal of contributing towards the ultimate reliability, robustness and efficiency of the entire Internet.

"The ultracapacitor is a unique electrochemical energy storage system for high power applications from pulse communication to hand-held tools to electrical and hybrid vehicles. Possessing higher power density, a faster charge/discharge rate, and longer cycle life than conventional batteries or fuel cells, on one hand, and higher energy density than conventional catalytic capacitors on the other, ultracapacitors can fill the gap between these. Ultracapacitor-battery (or fuel cell) hybrid systems are very effective in handling high power and extending the life of batteries or fuel cells.  Thus, ultracapacitors have become a critical enabling technology for high power electronics and automotives, especially for electrical vehicles.



The scope of the proposed Discovery Grant is to explore novel material systems for high power and high energy ultracapacitor devices. These new material systems will be comprised of novel electrode materials chemically modified for enhanced energy storage capacity, and polymer electrolytes for high performance and easy processing.  The success of the program will result a new platform of electrochemical storage devices that is high in performance, safe to use, with flexible form factors and free from traditional ""metal can"" packaging.  Along the way, we will develop an understanding of the mechanism of the interactions between the materials so that we can design and engineer the material system for ultracapacitor applications and other electrochemical energy storage systems.

"Multihop wireless networking refers to the network paradigm where messages are transmitted over multiple hops of wireless links. Example network architectures include wireless mesh networks, mobile ad hoc networks, and wireless sensor networks. They complement the conventional single-hop cellular wireless systems and, in many areas, they are poised to replace the conventional wireless networks to provide important services such as mobile broadband Internet access, remote environmental monitoring, and localized communication for national security and disaster recovery. 

    Commercial applications of multihop wireless networks are broad. Examples in Canada include the metropolitan-scale broadband mesh network to blanket the Toronto downtown area in 2007, remote forest fire detection in the western provinces, and mobile monitoring networks for fisheries on the Atlantic coast. However, the efficient operation of such networks must overcome many unique challenges. 

    The proposed research program is focused on the peer-to-peer nature of multihop wireless systems, where the network participants not only compete with each other for system resources but can also collaborate toward overall efficient network operation. This collaborative communication paradigm represents a significant step forward from the traditional centralized networking environment. We aim toward realizing the vision of an autonomous multihop wireless system, where the network nodes utilize intelligent hardware and software to sense the environment and react by adaptive self-reconfiguration. This research program will create new theories and technologies toward promoting intelligent group collaboration among the peer nodes in multihop wireless systems. It will lead to efficient provisioning of application services and network functions, supporting intelligent system reconfiguration to meet diverse and evolving application requirements and networking environments.

"The objective of the proposed project is to study, analyze and develop mathematical modeling and computational methods for fluid flows in porous media and population growth in biology.



Oil and gas, which currently cannot be replaced, are important energy resources in the modern world. The most viable way to efficiently exploit petroleum reserves is the use of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. Mathematical modeling of flows in porous media is playing an increasingly important role in EOR and reservoir simulations, which provides an efficient tool for understanding the complex chemical, physical, and fluid flow processes in order to optimize the recovery of hydrocarbon in reservoirs. It is also very important in the remediation of the contamination in groundwater. The mathematical models are characterized by nonlinearities, convection dominance, moving steep fronts or interfaces, heterogeneities of media, multiple scales in porous media. These features lead to the numerical simulations of the systems in porous media to be severely difficult. Computational biology is also playing an important role in the study of the relation between species and their environment. There are particular interests in studying the large-scale high-dimensional spatial field and long time predictions of the population growth in biology, and in modelling and controlling the epidemics of influenza in a large spatial range (among multi-cities or multi-countries).



The project includes: (1). Developing and Analyzing the adaptive ELLAM combining with wavelets for fluid flows in porous media; (2). Developing and analyzing the splitting domain decomposition methods for compressible fluid flows in porous media; (3). Upscaling for miscible flows in strongly heterogeneous porous media; (4).

"Distributed sensor networks are attracting more and more interest in applications for large-scale monitoring of the environment, civil structures, roadways, animal habitats, etc. With the rapidly increasing number of large-scale sensor network deployments, the vision of a World-Wide Sensor Web (WSW) is becoming a reality. Similar to the World-Wide Web (WWW), which acts essentially as a ""World-Wide Computer"", the Sensor Web can be considered as a ""World-Wide Sensor"" or a ""cyberinfrastructure"" that instruments and monitors the physical world at temporal and spatial scales that are currently impossible. The WSW will generate tremendous volumes of priceless data, enabling scientists to observe previously unobservable phenomena.

    One major reason that the development of the WSW has been greatly limited is the lack of a spatial information infrastructure that connects many heterogeneous sensor networks to the applications that desire sensor network data. Therefore, there is a desire for a spatial information infrastructure designed specifically for the WSW. The spatial information infrastructure would aggregate the independent geo-sensor networks into a coherent Spatial Sensor Web (SSW). The objective of this proposed research is to design and implement the Sense-Able GIS, which is a new software platform for constructing such SSW.

    We propose a new Peer-to-Peer GIS architecture to construct the Sense-Able GIS. The Sense-Able GIS will operate on a cooperative model that allows the system to scale to accommodate an enormous amount of mobile and transient sensors. The Sense-Able GIS will allow (1) sensor networks to publish their geographically referenced sensing resources; (2) applications to subscribe to sensing resources in their areas of interest; and (3) relevant sensing resources to be autonomously pushed to all interested applications. The Sense-Able GIS can be considered as a platform technology and can be applied to a wide range of applications, from habitat monitoring, forest management, emergency response to oil and gas pipeline management.

"Wind energy has been the fastest growing energy source over the last decade. In spite of the increased

popularity of wind energy, wind turbines (WTs) are still experiencing costly repair, productivity loss and

catastrophic breakdowns due to undetected component faults. Gearboxes and bearings are among the most

failure-prone WT components because of their harsh, volatile working conditions. This along with their

restricted access and remote locations calls for an on-line monitoring system. However, an effective monitoring

system is not yet available.



We have developed a cost effective and easy to implement technique (patent pending) to detect gearbox and

bearing faults. This technique is based on the Teager energy operator (TEO). It can effectively extract incipient

gearbox and bearing fault signatures. This technique is reliable, versatile, and much less susceptible to

condition changes. A prototype has been developed and tested against two commercial monitors. The tests

clearly demonstrated the technical superiority of our technology. The goal of the proposed project is to test our

technology for WT applications and to begin technology transfer to Canadian industry. The objectives are to:

(1) conduct systematic lab tests using a WT test rig and field data from a WT subject to various condition

changes, (2) identify optimal sensor/detector configurations, and develop an optimized TEO algorithm for wind

turbines, and (3) design a prototype suitable for testing in a real WT in collaboration with an industrial partner.



This technology, once fully tested and transferred to Canadian industry, will help reduce WT maintenance cost,

downtime and avoid catastrophic failures by timely and responsive diagnosis of gearbox and bearing

conditions. This will have a profound impact on Canadian economy and global environment.","Manufacturing processes and products","Manufacturing processes and products","Mechanical Engineering","Liang, Ming","I2IPJ ","Industrial engineering","Industrial engineering","G�nie industriel","1 & 2-2"

"The pulp and paper industry in Canada has faced significant challenges in terms of waste (water, air emmision, and solids) management. Furthermore, the pulp and paper mills are expect to achieve closed cycle operation. 



Although conventional treatment technologies are used for wastewater treatment and air pollution control, current technologies have a lot of disadvantages. For example, conventional biological treatment of wastewater faces the challenges of biomass separations. Sludge bulking is not uncommon. Furthermore, in-mill treatment for closed cycle operation requires a high efficient, compact, and small footprint treatment system that provides high quality of treated effluent for subsequent reuse. In addition, incinerators are frequently associated with flameout problems, due to the low fuel value of the stripper over head gas. This outrage can result in permit violations due to emission of the unburned gases.



The goal of this study is to develop innovative membrane bioreactor technology for in-mill treatment for closed cycle operation and air emission control of pulp and paper mills. It is anticipated that membrane bioreactor technology developed from this study will achieve a higher efficiency, a lower operating cost, and a smaller footprint, a superior quality of treated effluent and air streams that are not achieveable with current technologies.

"The general objective of this proposed research program is to discover the theorems, algorithms, and solutions for a number of issues related to the moment descriptors in the field of image analysis. 



Since the moments of an image can uniquely provide global characteristics and geometrical features of the image with some invariant properties, the moment methods have been utilized in many applications in image analysis, pattern recognition, object classification, and many other scientific fields in recent years. However, the theoretical supports on some fundamental issues have not attracted sufficient attention, and the lack of such supports has limited the role that moment descriptors are able to play. These issues include:



(1)    )	The need to discover new types of image moments to enrich the moment methods;



(2)    )	The prospect of applying moment methods to images stained by various types of noise;



(3)    )	The relationship between global moments and local moments of the same image. 



This proposed research intends to undertake the abovementioned three outstanding issues. To resolve these subjects, the new theorems, algorithms, and techniques are needed to be developed. The answers to these inquiries will undoubtedly have strong impacts on the moment-based applications in image analysis and other scientific fields.

"The last several decades have seen a rapid growth of global oil consumption, especially from some developing countries like China and India. To meet the increasing global oil demand, the oil industry has to rely on enhanced recovery procedure, which involves the injection of water (or Carbon Dioxide) into a reservoir to build up the pressure gradient of oil and gas. If properly designed and implemented, the enhanced recovery procedure can increase oil production by at least 10-15%. 



Unfortunately, the motion of fluids in an underground reservoir is not directly observable or measurable, so the only way is to use computational simulation, which requires information of reservoir properties such as absolute permeability, porosity and saturation, heterogeneities and some other important mechanisms like diffusion and dispersion. However those parameters are not directly observable or measurable, instead, they can only be estimated through some mathematical methods, for instance, inverse problem. 



The goal of this project is to create a general computational framework by integrating inverse modeling of multiphase flows in porous media, efficient numerical algorithm for solving partial differential equations, efficient gradient-based optimization method and parallel computation. This framework will provide petroleum engineer with an efficient tool to estimate parameters in the governing equations that describe multiphase flow in porous media. It is expected that, successful implementation of this project will result in a better knowledge of the underground reservoir properties and therefore a more efficient enhanced recovery procedure can be designed and implemented.

"This research aims to investigate how to improve the control of the built environment through the use of inferential sensors and inferential control schemes. Through this research, new knowledge on building automation, environmental monitoring, and assessment of the built environment will be generated. The short-term objectives are to enhance current building control algorithms and schemes through the development and use of inferential sensor and inferential control technology and to develop a widely accepted method and experimental facility for testing the performance of building automation devices and systems. The long-term objectives are to study mathematic and physical fundamentals of inferential sensing and inferential control technology and to understand their impacts on the classic control theory.  

In the built environment, many variables that are critical for the optimal operation of the building systems are difficult, if not impossible, to be directly measured due to economical and/or technical reasons. An inferential sensor is based on inferential modeling that associate one critical variable with a number of relevant variables that can be easily measured. A variety of approaches will be applied in the inferential modeling, including physical model, stochastic and statistical method, and neuro-fuzzy systems. The inferential sensing technologies will be integrated with conventional control schemes to design inferential control schemes. Two approaches will be applied: model-based predictive control and cascaded feedback inferential control. The inferential control schemes will significantly simplify the design and implementation of building automation systems. 

The research objectives will be achieved through a variety of research activities: literature study and survey, theoretical study on inferential sensors and control algorithms, simulation study, and experimental study in laboratory. The technologies and new knowledge will help improve energy efficiency and indoor environment quality of buildings.

"The objective of our research is to introduce a set of tools and techniques for building and configuring highly-customizable software. Software that is highly-customizable allows users with limited or no technical skills and knowledge to easily configure it so that it perfectly fits their unique characteristics and needs. The current software development practice underestimates the need for intuitive and accessible customization facilities, mainly due to the absence of systematic methods for constructing them. This is evident in several application domains, such as common desktop applications (word processors or e-mail clients) and their ""bloated"" configuration screens or packaged information systems and the overwhelming costs that organizations pay for customizing them to fit their individual business needs. 



To address these issues, we propose a problem-oriented approach to software customization. We suggest that, instead of referring to the technicalities of the desired configuration, users can use specially designed languages for describing the characteristics of the problem at hand, such as their particular goals and preferences and the state of the environment they are in. Then, software tools can translate the description of the problem into the actual software configuration that best solves it. This would allow common users to obtain the customization that best fits their needs without any reference to low-level technical details. Our investigation involves studying language designs that are appropriate for this purpose, exploring methods for designing translators of problem descriptions into software configurations of existing systems, as well as understanding the process of designing software that is amenable to such customization methods and whose configurability aspect correctly and completely reflects the variability of the problem. Such a problem-oriented approach would both make common personal software more accessible to less technically skilled users, and, in the case of organizations, dramatically reduce the cost of customizing and administering their complex software infrastructures.

"The growth of video sharing over the Internet is forecast to represent 50 percent of all traffic by 2012 (Cisco Systems Inc.). High performance data centres such as high-speed routers and storage networks are expected to support this increase in bandwidth as the speed of processors increases. However, the full computational potential of processors is becoming difficult to achieve in data centres. Electrical data buses between interconnected processors and shared memory are bandwidth limited and exhibit high losses as the data rate increases. Consequently, the power dissipation of off-chip data communication is significant. In fact, today's data communication is responsible for 0.5% of carbon dioxide emissions globally (2007 Gartner Group estimation). In the future, this power dissipation will be limiting the performance scalability of data centres. To address this limitation, the investigator is proposing a research program in the area of low-power photonic interconnects for data centres.



Photonic interconnects offers a high capacity platform with key features over copper, most notably scalable bandwidth by exploiting the parallelism and capacity of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). However, significant power dissipation still resides in the signal conversion between the electrical and optical domains. In current approaches, the power dissipation is coupled to bandwidth utilisation and increases with the number of optical wavelengths. The investigator's research program is on the development of novel approaches built in Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC) devices to decouple the power dissipation from bandwidth and enable better performance in data centres. The research program emphasis is on the validation of theoretical work by integrating PIC devices within a demonstrator system to perform complete data transfer in a computer cluster architecture replicating a data centre. The research program will lead to lower power dissipation in photonic interconnects in high performance data centres.","Computer communications","Information and communication services","Electrical and Computer Engineering","LiboironLadouceur, Odile","RGPIN ","Photon devices","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",1-5

"The next generation of three-dimensional (3D) imaging systems, laser range cameras (LRCs), offer great potential for biomedical engineering applications that demand highly accurate 3D data for constructing analytical models of the human body. Unlike current technologies used in biomedical applications, such as digital cameras, laser scanners and X-rays, an LRC rapidly captures full scenes of 3D data with only a single, low-cost camera and without exposing the subject to harmful radiation or the need for multiple, expensive sensors. Due to the recent commercial availability of LRCs, the data processing methods needed for 3D biomedical applications requiring high accuracy are either in their infancy or non-existent. The principal aims of this research project are therefore to enhance the metric potential of this technology by developing and experimentally validating the necessary mathematical models and associated algorithms. The outcomes will be implemented in software that is highly likely to attract commercial interest in Canada and overseas. Furthermore, the project will train numerous highly qualified personnel who will be international experts in this frontier technology. Biomedical applications that will benefit include cranio-facial scanning, scoliosis mapping and full human body measurement.

"Computer security is of paramount importance in our highly technology-reliant society.  Many people rely on computer systems to conduct business, communicate with friends and family, and manage their personal information.  Unfortunately, the safety and security of our current computing systems is not adequate for amount of trust people place in them.  The proposed research aims to improve the security of our computer systems by securing the foundation upon which they run, which is composed of low-level systems software such as the operating system and the software layers below it.  Securing this low-level software will not only make our computing infrastructure secure, but will reduce the cost of adoption by leaving higher-level software such as applications and servers intact.



This proposed research will achieve these goals by exploring mechanisms and techniques that can be incorporated into two low-level systems layers: operating system kernels and virtual machine monitors (VMM).  The VMM is software layer that runs underneath the operating system kernel.  The proposal will aim to improve computer system security through three main thrusts of research.  One thrust will explore the use of VMMs to create secure containers that will be able to protect critical software and data from attack.  Another thrust will explore the use of VMMs to detect and eradicate malicious software that has infected critical software on a system, including the operating system.  The final thrust will leverage current commodity multi-core processors to allow the operating system kernel to better fend off attacks.  This research will produce a more secure foundation for our current computing infrastructure, thus allowing businesses, individuals and governments to have more confidence in the safety and security of their computing systems.

"The size of tree crowns is linked to the productivity, water use and health of forests.  In this proposal my students and I will explore the factors that control the development of crowns in trees.   Put simply, crown size is controlled by the vertical and lateral extension of shoot and branches and the self-pruning of branches at the bottom of the crown.  In terms of self-pruning, we plan studies that will test the hypothesis that as the lower branches of shade intolerant species enter zones of low light, these branches develop xylem with lower hydraulic conductivity and therefore they tend to restrict the water supply to the leaves of these lower branches.  Shade tolerant species are proposed to have less change in hydraulic conductivity in branches and therefore slower self-pruning.  Secondly, I propose that shade intolerant species will tend to allocate more of the sugars that they produce to upper branches and tend to remove mobile nutrients such as N from lower branches once they begin to experience shading.   In terms of lateral extension of branches, I want to explore the linkage of branch extension with nutrient supply and changes in hydraulic conductivity of branches.  Trees from field fertilization trials will be used to examine crown width and stem hydraulics.  Crown friction from the collision of trees during their sway in wind is also thought to cause breakage of twigs and buds, thereby limiting lateral expansion of crowns.  This will be explored by a regional study of crown width of trees from fully-stocked conifer forests in zones of different wind speeds.   We will also study the effects of wind on stem shape and crown development in trees growing in zones of different wind speed. This work will provide new insights into the way that crowns develop and help managers control this important feature of tree growth under management or climate change.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Renewable Resources","Lieffers, Victor","RGPIN ",Silviculture,"Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",2-5

"Despite the importance of macromolecular structure in unraveling the biochemical basis of life, experimental structure determination remains a long, difficult, and expensive endeavour. The interest in protein structures is motivated by the general mantra that protein function is dictated by protein structure. This suggests that knowledge of protein structure is helpful not only in analysis of wildtype (or natural) proteins but also for mutant proteins such as those implicated in disease processes. Consequently, knowledge of protein structure has emerged as a critical resource for drug discovery and development. In the future, macromolecular structure determination will be an automated turn-key operation, and should be fast, inexpensive, and high-yield. My proposed research focuses on developing accurate and efficient algorithms to expedite the process of experimental protein structure determination. The proposed research program integrates knowledge from structural biology with algorithms in machine learning, machine vision, and computational search. The long-term goals of my interdisciplinary research program are to develop and apply techniques from Computer Science and Engineering to problems in Structural Biology (the study of protein structure and function). The research highlighted in this proposal represents part of a family of projects in my lab including algorithm development for experimental structure determination, protein design, structure-based drug design, and chemical synthesis planning. In this proposal, we describe several novel computational approaches for automating current experimental bottlenecks in X-Ray Crystallography and Electron CryoMicroscopy. As useful algorithmic milestones are achieved, we will package our software and make it freely available to the research community.","Information systems and technology","Information and communication services","Computer Science","Lilien, Ryan","RGPIN ","Modelling and simulation studies","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",1-5

"This Discovery Grant application is to continue the research program on the fundamentals of spouting and fluidization phenomena, and the application of these technologies for environmentally friendly processes and clean energy production. Three specific projects are proposed: (1) Hydrodynamics of conical and slot-rectangular spouted beds at elevated temperature, (2) Application of conical spouted bed for simultaneous drying and torrefaction of biomass, and (3) Hydrogen production from propane dehydrogenation in a novel fluidized bed membrane reactor (FBMR). 

Spouting has been under research and development for many thermal energy processes, such as biomass drying, combustion, and gasification, and ethylene glycol reforming for hydrogen production. Temperature effects on spouting stability, flow regimes, and key hydrodynamic parameters, which are critical for the process development, will be studied. Torrefaction of biomass is a thermal treatment process in the absent of oxygen at temperature from 200-300C to produce ""Biochar"". Spouted beds that provide vigorous solids motion and intimate gas-solids contact should have a higher heat and mass transfer over the current fixed bed or screw type reactors. 

Hydrogen demand is expected to grow significantly in the future. In the short term, most of the increased demand will likely be satisfied by the traditional steam methane reforming. Hydrocarbon dehydrogenation holds the potential of supplying significant amounts of high purity hydrogen through use of hydrogen permeable membranes. The propane dehydrogenation in the FBMR offers a number of advantages over the current fixed bed reactor, such as uniform temperature, good heat transfer, high catalyst efficiency and the possibility of continuous regeneration of the catalyst.  

These projects will train one PhD, 4 Master's and 5 undergraduate students with high research ability careers in industry or academic environments

"The proposed research is to develop thin Pd-based composite membranes for hydrogen separation applications at high temperatures. The short term objectives of this research are to: (1) seek Pd-based alloys possessing both appropriate hydrogen permeability and good thermal stability, (2) develop techniques for depositing promising alloys on suitable substrates to form thin pinhole-free Pd-based composite membrane, and (3) study impacts of impurities on hydrogen permeation performance of these thin alloy composite membranes. The long term objectives are to: (1) develop thin Pd-based alloy composite membranes with appropriate stability at high temperatures (500-650C) and (2) scale-up the techniques for preparing these composite membranes so that they have sufficient area to be suitable for practical industrial applications.

         An important component is to train highly qualified graduate engineers and scientists to support an emerging fuel cell industry in Canada. The proposed research provides a unique training opportunity for students, postdoctoral fellows and faculties. Students and PDFs will gain extensive training in membrane preparation, characterization and test, in data analysis, membrane separation/reaction and its modeling. This project also provides an excellent opportunity to the students/PDFs to interface with industry by participating in joint meetings and participating in hydrogen production in membrane reactors. 

         The availability of cheap and pure hydrogen is a critical factor to the success of hydrogen fuel cell car. FBMR-SMR is very promising process to produce hydrogen cost-effectively with the required purity for fuel cell. A critical issue facing the FBMR-SMR process is the availability of thin pinhole-free hydrogen selective membranes. The main objective of this project is to address this issue. Hence, the success of this project will significantly improve the FBMR-SMR process for hydrogen production, and consequently, will benefit the entire fuel cell industry. Training of highly qualified personnel and developing related innovative technologies are essential elements to expand Canadian hydrogen economy and to maintain its lead in this field.

"Electrospinning is a technique that uses an electrostatic field to spin ultrathin fibers having diameters ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers. Because of their small diameter, electrospun fibers exhibit many unique properties, such as very high surface-to-volume ratio, enhanced interaction with the surrounding medium, increased bioactivity, and higher strength than their bulk materials. While electrospun fibers have received sustained interest in the biomedical, sensor, and filtration areas, to our knowledge, they have not been exploited for food applications. Many proteins are edible and biocompatible, making electrospun protein fibers an ideal carrier for bioactive agents in food applications (e.g., nutraceuticals, micronutrients, drugs) that require, for example, protection from deleterious processing and harsh gastric conditions. In studies we conducted over the past two and a half years, we observed some unique electrospinning behaviors for proteins, which are very different compared to those for synthetic polymers used by most other studies reported in the literature. To achieve the long-term goal of producing nano-scale electrospun protein fibers that are robust for food applications, a fundamental understanding of electrospinning of protein fibers is essential. The objectives of this research program are: (1) to develop a fundamental understanding of the electrospinning of protein fibers; (2) to elucidate the mechanism(s) of positive effects of poly(ethylene oxide) on electrospinning of biopolymer solutions; (3) to enhance the material properties of electrospun fibers through protein aggregation/assembly. Specifically, we will conduct systematic studies to elucidate the nature of protein-PEO interactions and determine how these interactions affect the electrospinning of aqueous protein dope. We will investigate ultrasonic techniques to manipulate fiber morphology, and mimic the biological spinneret of spiders to induce protein aggregate/assembly to enhance the material properties of electrospun fibers.","Materials sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Food Science","Lim, LoongTak","RGPIN ","Food science and technology","Food science and technology","Science et technologie de l'alimentation",1-1
"Although processing of food is important to impart desirable changes and render the product safe for

consumption, it can also degrade micronutrients and other active ingredients in foods. To make up for the

degradation losses, the product may be fortified with micronutrients to enhance its nutritional values.

Nevertheless, many micronutrients are not stable which can react with other food components, potentially

reducing its nutritional and organoleptic qualities. Therefore, the fortified micronutrient must be protected.

Within the past decade, considerable advancement has taken place on the electrospinning technology which

is capable for producing ultrafine fibers. By incorporating micronutrient in a carrier polymer and spinning into

ultrafine fibers using the electrospinning process, we hypothesized that the micronutrient can be stabilized

through physical immobilization and chemical interaction with the polymer. We theorized that the

polymer-micronutrient interaction can reduce the impact of deleterious factors during processing and storage,

such as heat, oxygen, water, and other reactive food components. By formulating a proper carrier material and

optimizing the fiber structure, the bioavailability of micronutrients can potentially be enhanced.

We proposed to collaborate with H.J. Heinz Canada to develop a method of using electrospinning

technique to stabilize and enhance the bioavailability of micronutrients in fortified foods. To the best of our

knowledge, this technique has not been applied to food. Heinz, being one of the largest food processors in

Canada, will be in a strong position to provide production and commercial expertise to utilize this technology.

This project will focus on: (1) Advancement of electrospinning technology for spinning protein fiber, (2)

Understanding of the interaction between electrospun protein fiber and micronutrients, and (3) Application of

micronutrient in food products using fiber carrier.","Processed food products and beverages","Manufacturing processes and products","Food Science","Lim, LoongTak","STPGP ","Food processing, packaging, preservation and storage","Food science and technology","Science et technologie de l'alimentation",3-3

"With the rapid growth in computer power, scientists are increasingly performing their experiments on computers, with the underlying physical mechanisms represented and implemented by computer codes. In some applications, the number of inputs is very large. In others, the computer codes are fast and call for a large number of trials. In addition, these large-scale experiments can have different types of inputs and outputs. For example, the inputs can be qualitative and quantitative while the outputs can be multivariate, functional or space-time. Such applications have brought new and important challenges to the design and analysis of computer experiments. The objective of the proposed research is to develop new statistical methodology for helping scientists conduct and analyze large-scale computer experiments. This proposal will address the following problems: 1) to develop methodology for building an emulator with a large set of trials; 2) to construct designs for screening experiments; 3) to construct mixed-level orthogonal arrays of high strength and space-filling designs with high dimensional projection property; 4) to generate large robust designs for computer experiments with both control and noise variables. It is expected that the proposed research will provide theoretical development and practical recommendations for large-scale computer experiments. In addition, new collections of designs will be made available online for quick and broad dissemination.



The second part of the proposal is motivated by the National Assessment of Educational Progress Survey. There is concern that the first-stage sampling fractions may not be negligible, while at the second stage it should be treated as negligible. As the variance estimation is done presently, the primary sampling units are treated as if they were sampled with replacement. This generally leads to overestimation of the variance. The proposed research will develop methods to handle this issue. New results will have significant impacts on the variance estimation methodology for survey agencies such as Statistics Canada.

"Most natural and artificial systems consist of many interacting subsystems, each of which is capable of complex fluctuation with multifractal characteristics. However, a full understanding of the complex dynamics is yet an intractable task due to the lack of complete mathematical models and computational power for a full scale simulation when such models exist. The study of multiple multifractality provides an alternative and opportunity to reach beyond a phenomenological discussion and begins to address such basic questions as the origin and ""meaning"" of the common appearance of multifractality in natural and artificial systems. The objective of the proposed research has a twofold objective. First, we will develop the systematic framework to study multiple multifractality. We will then apply the result to further the on-going research of the multifractal origin of heart rate variability (HRV) in human. Specifically, the proposed research will be based on the central hypothesis of a higher control center influence leading to the multifractality in HRV. A specific set of experiments involving data collection and numerical analysis will be conducted to test the hypothesis. The development of multifractal correlation analysis is anticipated to provide new tool for complex system analysis and to generate new results on the nature of brain-heart interaction leading to multifractal HRV.

"Immune cell trafficking in tissues is crucial for immune responses and is mediated by various environmental cues such as adhesion molecules and chemoattractants. The focus of past research has been on the roles of individual adhesion molecules and chemoattractants in guiding immune cell trafficking, and the biological mechanisms for cells to detect and respond to simplified non-varying adhesion and migration signals. Because cells are exposed to multiple and spatiotemporally varying directing signals in vivo, understanding immune cell trafficking in complex cellular environment is important for both basic science and clinical research. But very few studies have tried to examine such challenging complexities. The long-term goal of my Discovery program aims at integrating cell biology and immunology approaches, biophysical analysis and novel microfluidic tools to achieve a quantitative and systematic understanding of immune cell trafficking in complex cellular environments. In the first granting period, my focus is on understanding immune cell migration in complex chemoattractant fields. I will apply unique microfluidic systems for quantitative analysis of the migratory behaviours of leukocytes in superimposed and dynamically varying chemoattractant fields. Furthermore, I will investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms with the focus on the role of ligand-induced chemoattractant receptor signalling for immune cell migration in response to spatiotemporal chemotactic signals. I will use a combined approach by experimentally examining the effect of several mutated nondesensitizable chemokine receptors in the migration of both primary leukocytes and myeloid cell lines, and through mathematical modelling and computer simulations. The proposed research will generate exciting insights into immune cell migration and chemotaxis in complex chemoattractant fields and will pave the way for understanding the complex interactions between cells and the guiding environment. My research program will contribute significantly to the biology of immune cell trafficking in tissues, which will be highly relevant to a wide range of physiological problems and diseases such as  wound healing, autoimmune diseases and cancers.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Physics and Astronomy","Lin, Francis","RGPIN ",Biophysics,Physics,Physique,1-5
"An adaptive learning system (AL system) is able to adapt its behavior to the learner's needs by personalizing educational curricula and contents, and by providing remedial or tutorial tailored to the properties of the individual learner. To adapt its behavior, an AL system must consider the differences among learners in terms of learning objectives, knowledge, experience, learning styles, and learning preferences. In an AL system with an agent-based architecture, an intelligent agent is associated with each learner or a specific task to simulate a course instructor or tutor performing pedagogical tasks. Due to its distributed nature and task complexity, an agent-based AL system is structured as a multi-agent system. The abilities of the agents to adapt rationally in an open environment hinge on possessing factual knowledge, such as knowledge of curricula, learners, educational resources, and, most importantly, possessing reasoning capabilities. The reasoning capabilities include ""understanding"" learner characteristics and knowledge domains; the ability to plan and optimize study plans and learning activities; the ability to update learning models; coordination of the intervention of a set of task-specific agents; and coalition formation for collaborative learning, etc. Existing learning systems, however, have their reasoning mechanisms hardwired for specific domains, and the domain-specific nature of the reasoning mechanisms restricts the reusability of the systems themselves. This proposal highlights a new methodology for formalizing the reasoning models and mechanisms for the agents of AL systems. In the short-term, this research will focus on designing algorithms for adaptive course planning, adaptive testing, and adaptive coalition formation for collaborative learning, and applying different models and mechanisms to different tasks to determine which option is the most appropriate in each instance. In the long-term, this research will attempt to develop a fully open and scalable, agent-based learning environment. The technology to be developed in the research will facilitate further R&D in modern distributed learning. Also, the students to be trained through this project will become pioneer engineers or researchers in agent-based intelligent systems.

"A useful extended range weather forecast of 7-30 days is of considerable social and economical importance. However, in contrast to short range weather forecasting and seasonal prediction, the study and development of prediction methods for this range have been weak. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a strong large-scale tropical signal that has a relatively regular 30-50 day period. The intraseasonal timescale of the circulation and convective anomalies produced by the MJO suggests the potential for significant impact on forecasts beyond one week. Growing evidence indicates that the importance of the MJO to a subseasonal forecast is just like that of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to a seasonal prediction.



The primary objective of this program is to explore the extent to which the MJO influences the weather in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, especially in Canada, to investigate its physical mechanisms, and to examine how dynamical models can benefit from the tropical MJO information in predicting atmospheric conditions on a time scale from a week to a season.



Global observational data from different sources including extensive satellite observations are to be used to reveal the association of the MJO and weather anomalies in the extratropics, with special attention on the weather in Canada. Numerical models are to be utilized to simulate the process, perform diagnostic analysis for its physical mechanisms, and conduct forecast experiments. It is expected that this work will clarify some important issues related to tropics-extratropics interactions, and contribute to the development of intraseasonal weather forecasting capability in Canada.

"My long term objective of research is a better understanding of structural and tectonic evolution of ancient mountain belts, evolution of tectonic processes through time, and structural and tectonic controls on mineralization. The proposed study will focus on two ancient mountain belts, the Archean Superior craton in Canada and the Paleozoic Central Asian Orogenic Belt in China. 

     My work on the Superior craton has led to the recognition of evidence for both vertical and horizontal tectonism, and more importantly for their synchronous operation. We have proposed that synchronous vertical and horizontal tectonism was an important process in the Neoarchean and represented a transition from dominant vertical tectonism in the Meso-(and Paleo-?) Archean to dominant horizontal tectonism in Proterozoic and Phanerozoic, and that such a synchronous process was important for gold mineralization. These interpretations were mostly based on data from the northwestern Superior craton in Manitoba. Here we propose to test these interpretations and their general applicability, not only through continuing work in the northwestern Superior craton, but more importantly through additional work in the southern Superior craton in Ontario. In addition, we will investigate the relative significance of vertical and horizontal tectonism and its variation with time and space (if any). We suspect that there existed a feedback relationship between the two processes and will explore the possible mechanisms for this. The results will have significant implications for Archean geological evolution in general and for Archean gold mineralization. The latter will help exploration targeting in Archean terranes worldwide. 

     My work in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt will focus on the geometry, kinematics, and temporal evolution of major terrane-bounding shear zones. The results will shed significant light on the tectonic evolution of this enormous orogenic belt.

"Road safety and efficiency are major concerns worldwide. Therefore, it is crucial to explore new techniques to improve road safety and efficiency. The proposed research program aims to investigate the applicability of emerging vehicular communication networks, also known as vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), as a promising approach to increasing road safety and efficiency. In VANETs, vehicles are equipped with wireless communication, positioning and computation devices with a variety of vehicle applications enabled by communication between vehicles such as emergency braking warning. Unfortunately, VANETs have faced various security threats and privacy concerns which would jeopardize public safety and become the main barrier to the acceptance of such a new technology. As a result, security is crucial to success of VANETs, and so is thereby a prerequisite for market-ready VANETs. In the past, insufficient attention has been paid to this area of research, in particular security in vehicular delay tolerant networks (DTNs), where end-to-end network connectivity between vehicles is not available. Traditional approaches may not be suitable in such a vehicular DTN due to its unique characteristics, such as intermittent connectivity due to high-speed mobility of the network node (or vehicle), resource scarcity, and the extremely large amount of network nodes. The proposed research is envisioned to solve the security and privacy issues in vehicular DTNs, which have not been taken into consideration in previously reported studies. It is expected that this research program will contribute to the discovering of new ideas and the development of innovative automotive products and services. As a result, new business models and revenue streams can be devised to foster growth and promote the troubled automobile industry in Canada. The research will also lead to HQP training in information security and vehicular communication techniques, which will greatly contribute to the Canadian communication, automobile and information security industries.

"The first part concerns with the analysis and qualitative properties of the solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations in mathematical biology models (tumor and optical biosensor models), thermistor problems (Micromachined structures fabrication with radiation and temperature effects), option pricing (portfolio valuations and managements), multiscale models in nano-materials sciences, porous media flows (oil discovery and underground water managements).  This involves the questions of existence, uniqueness, continuous dependence upon the data and asymptotic behavior as time approaches infinity.  



The second part concerns the developments, analysis, implementations, and applications of efficient numerical methods for mathematical models (almost all involves interfaces) mentioned above, in particular for interface problems. These are characterized by the presence of discontinuities and /or singularities on surfaces, which may be moving or stationary, due to abrupt changes in materials or build up of charges or other effects. The focus will be mainly on linear and quadratic immersed element analysis and computations on uniform grids since such high order elements will definitely produce very accurate numerical solutions. These will in turn generate better resolutions for the interfaces and allow a better understanding of the physical phenomena associated with moving interfaces. Applications vary from problems in financial option pricing to questions arising in biology, e.g., study of blood flow in flexible tubes; of cell dynamics and motility; and of tumor growth and cancer modeling.

"Imbalance of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been considered as the major cause of global warming. Many approaches to reducing CO2 emission have been proposed. Using ethanol to replace a portion of gasoline is one of the promising approaches. With a slight modification of the existing ethanol production process, using a high sugar-content substrate becomes possible. However, feeding with a high sugar-content substrate does not guarantee high ethanol yield, but would lead to yeast cell death. Such an adverse result is attributed to a combined osmotic effect due to high sugar concentration and inhibitory effect due to high ethanol level. The detailed cause of such an adverse outcome is still unclear. The global ethanol production in 2005 was nearly 14 billion liters. A one-percent increase in ethanol productivity would translate to tens of million of dollars in profit. Thus a high ethanol-yield production process is welcome. 

  

The objective of this proposal is to study the yeast cellular activity, function, and viability at different gravity conditions; particularly in a very-high-gravity environment (i.e., > 250 g glucose/l). Contemporary molecular biology approaches will be used to investigate whole-cell gene expression and protein expression profiling of a commercial yeast strain. The strain will be cultivated under different conditions similar to those used in industrial processes. The harvested samples will be analyzed using microarray technology and tandem mass spectrometry. Along with measured metabolite concentrations, gene and protein information will be combined and integrated by means of metabolic flux analysis. The biological information extracted from flux analysis will be used to design a proper cultivation strategy, which will be subsequently implemented in the development of a high ethanol-yield and a high-profit fermentation process.

"Le milieu m�dical b�n�ficie aujourd'hui d'une grande vari�t� d'imageurs qui permettent d'explorer et de visualiser, parfois de fa�on non invasive, l'anatomie et le fonctionnement des organes du corps humain. Dans le cas des neurosciences, la visualisation du cerveau 'en action' fournit des informations pr�cieuses pour les neuro-cliniciens : la planification d'une chirurgie c�r�brale, le suivi post-op�ratoire ou post-traumatique de la r�cup�ration des fonctions c�r�brales, la pr�diction de dysfonctionnements (les crises �pileptiques) ou encore la connaissance des  m�canismes d'apprentissage. Ainsi, la mesure des signaux, en particulier les signaux �lectromagn�tiques g�n�r�s par l'activit� c�r�brale, donne une image fonctionnelle permettant de r�aliser des interventions mieux contr�l�es et de mener des recherches plus syst�matiques.

"Seamless multimedia communication over wired and wireless networks (such as the Internet or cellular networks) is a major thrust area in contemporary engineering. Many unresolved challenges in this area are related to compressing data so that limited storage and bandwidth resources are optimally utilized.

     The primary goal of the proposed research is the study of novel source coding methods that are especially suitable for the robust compression of multimedia signals when transmitted over communication channels in point-to-point systems and networks. New challenges in the analysis and design of such schemes are posed by having several users connected via multiple links of different capacities, as well as practical constraints on memory, complexity, and delay,  in contrast to the more developed traditional theory of source coding.  A deeper understanding of the underlying theoretical issues along with the discovery of algorithms with proven performance guarantees will further the construction of compression methods meeting the varied demands of ubiquitous communication networks.

     In particular, we will focus on source coding methods that exploit the underlying communication channel, such as joint source-channel coding for multiple-input multiple-output channels, progressive transmission, multiple description and multiterminal source coding. Building on our earlier research results we will also investigate the design and analysis of low-complexity, low-delay, universal sequential source coding schemes and adopt these to network source coding tasks.  The research will result in a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of lossy source coding and have an impact on the practical development of robust and flexible methods for the transmission of multimedia signals (e.g., text, speech, image, and video) in a network environment. The obtained results and the  training of highly qualified personnel through the research project (4 graduate students will be fully involved) will bring tangible benefit to the Canadian information technology industries.

"The research aims to provide an interactive multimedia computer application to train pediatric residents in effective diagnostic decision strategies. The approach includes research in human decision making, human computer interaction, biomedical engineering, information technology, and medicine. Application of knowledge of serious, systematic human decision biases as a basis for algorithm design in a medical diagnostic decision support system is, to the best of our knowledge, novel. Relatively inexperienced decision makers tend to jump to conclusions very rapidly, which is problematic when the stimulus information is ambiguous. As a consequence, the first item presented tends to weigh more heavily than justified by the evidence. In addition, research conducted over the past 25 years in different domains suggests that people have a poor understanding of the concept of diagnosticity, which is a measure of specificity and the frequency of occurrence of a given sign, symptom, or test result. Medical text books do not quantify symptom diagnosticity. Diagnosticians thus do not have access to this vital information but rely on cognitively taxing memorized lists of signs and symptoms associated with each disease. A proof-of-concept prototype has been developed with a database that is based on actual and complete patient records. The underlying algorithm determines the diagnosticity of each symptom or sign associated with a particular condition, respiratory distress in infants. Currently, the user interface is a simple GUI with a text-based interaction dialog. Upon user input of symptoms and signs, the system calculates the probability of different diseases associated with respiratory distress. It outputs the five topmost probabilities when the user elects to initiate a 'diagnose' function. The proposed research will expand the database and adopt a multimedia user interface that incorporates images such as X-rays as well as allowing free text user input. In addition, it will also be designed to offer suggestions for tests to conduct next or information to obtain to increase the probability of the most likely disease.

"Tracking of animal movement provides important information regarding habitat choice, activity patterns, allocation of time for different activities etc. For large animals, technology has long been available through bio-telemetry, but entomologists have traditionally been restricted to the use of indirect methods, such as mark-recapture,

Harmonic radar technology, originally invented to aid in locating avalanche victims, has been successfully adapted for use in tracking insect movement. The system normally used is based on a commercially available unit. 

I conduct research on plant-insect and inter-insect taxon interactions of primarily ground-dwelling or fairly stationary insect species. The ability to track the movement of individuals would facilitate a significant expansion in research allowing us to unravel hitherto unknown behaviors. Specifically, using harmonic radar tracking I will be able to investigate host choice mechanisms in the Warren root collar weevil, a relatively important pest of planted lodgepole pine, ant-ground beetle interactions which amy be critical for understanding community responses to anthropogenic disturbance, and movement patterns of the western conifer seed bug, the most important seed predator in conifer western Canadian seed orchards.

The research enabled by this equipment will contribute significantly to training several graduate and undergraduate students. With collaborators in Sweden and Canada, I will be able to provide international experience, comparative studies, and advanced spatial analysis of behaviors exhibited by these insects.

"My research continues to examine mechanisms of regulating ion and fluid balance in skeletal muscle and in intact mammals. The long-term objectives are to increase the basic knowledge and understanding of the processes affecting skeletal muscle function and whole body performance during activity and recovery from activity. The short-term objectives are to: 1) continue to study the function and regulation of the skeletal muscle sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (NKCC); 2) to begin to study mechanisms of regulating Na,K pump activity in skeletal muscle cells recovering from contractile activity; and 3) examine the influence of high intensity exercise on muscle potassium transport pathways during both the contractile period and during recovery. We use two main experimental approaches in an integrated manner that spans from molecular to the tissue level. The first approach uses an intact isolated rat hindlimb preparation that is perfused with an artificial blood of known and constant composition. The strength of this approach is that it permits the determination of net and unidirectional ion, metabolite and fluid fluxes between vascular and muscle compartments, together with measurements of ion and metabolite changes within the stratified fiber type population of the lower rat hindlimb. The conditions closely approximate those found in vivo, yet confer the benefits of increased control of perfusate composition and the experimental paradigm. The second approach uses mouse skeletal muscle bundles or single fibres studied in vitro to determine the time course of change in intracellular ion status, membrane potential and cell volume in response hypertonic stress, ion transport activators and ion transport inhibitors. This work is expected to improve our understanding of skeletal muscle and whole animal ion and fluid regulation during rest, exercise, fatigue and recovery. It is further expected that the results will transfer to the study of muscle pathologies involving electrolyte, contractile and metabolic imbalances such as muscular dystrophy and type II diabetes.

"Earth's topography is an important control for many catchment processes because it affects the distribution and flow of water, sediment, nutrients, and contaminants. As such, digital elevation models (DEMs), which convey information about the topography of an area, are widely applied in distributed simulation modelling of hydrological phenomena. Recent advancements in airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) have led to the development of a new generation of fine-resolution DEMs, capable of representing topographic detail at an unprecedented level. These data offer the potential to help model flow-related phenomena more accurately than before. This proposed research will examine the application of LiDAR DEMs to flow modelling. Specifically, two main issues will be examined: 1) the potential for improving the simulation of overland flow pathways in human-modified landscapes offered by these novel data, and 2) the ability of using topographic characteristics derived from fine-resolution DEM data to explain variation in the timing of streamflow in small intermittent headwater channels. The second of these research topics will require the development of extensive monitoring networks using novel sensors for measuring flow duration and timing. These studies will help to better our understanding of the application of these unique DEM data. Also, relatively little is known about the nature of streamflow in intermittent headwater channels, despite the fact that headwater channels are known to play an important role in the delivery of water and other materials to downstream waterways and that recent evidence suggests no-flow periods are becoming increasingly common in headwater catchments, perhaps due to climatic factors. This research will improve our knowledge of and ability to model streamflow timing in headwater channels.

"Most of the world's oil and gas production during the 21st century will come as the result of enhanced petroleum reservoir characterization.  This characterization will  involve the monitoring of reservoir changes by using all available geological, geophysical and reservoir production data. 



Reservoir characterization can be viewed as an extension of the geophysical technique known as cooperative inversion.  Cooperative inversion seeks to find an earth model which describes  all available data.  The proposed project would extend cooperative inversion so that earth models would accurately describe both the geoscience data and the production history data.  This process would utilize borehole data (well logs, cores), 3-D time-lapse seismic data, and production data, in order to hopefully find an earth model that describes the production history of an oil field. The inversion would require the use of robust geophysical and geological modeling, 3-D seismic imaging, rock physics relationships, reservoir simulation, combined with optimization methods.



Initially, we intend to apply cooperative inversion in model studies in order to better understand model parameterization, computational speed, algorithm robustness, and inversion ambiguity.  Our studies will involve both the use of existing software and the development of new computer algorithms for modeling and inversion. In order to convert geological models into reservoir simulator models (and vice-versa), we will apply rock physics relationships and the principles of model upscaling and downscaling.  Finally, we intend to apply cooperative inversion methods to real data sets from a producing oil field.  This would be one of the first formal applications of cooperative inversion to enhanced oil recovery.

"It is hard nowadays to meet someone living in Canada who has not lost someone close to them from cancer. During last century, once a rare disease, cancer has quickly evolved and become the second most common cause of mortality, next to heart disease. Cancer now kills 27% of men and 23% of women in Canada, and statistics has predicted a much higher risk to acquire cancer for today's Canadian population; one in every 2.4 males versus one in every 2.7 females will develop cancer in their lifetime. Carbohydrates hold the key in helping us understanding the origin, development and proliferation of cancer as well as infectious disease as they are primary mediator molecules playing central roles in all sorts of cell-cell communication and signal transduction. Studying protein-carbohydrate, carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions can enable us to design and synthesize effective therapeutics that can target the crucial pathways these diseases rely on.

OBJECTIVES

The long term objectives of our research are to develop and apply modern synthetic carbohydrate chemistry and bioorganic chemistry to the understanding of carbohydrate-protein interactions involved in tumorigenesis, cancer metastasis and infection, and to the design, synthesis and immunological evaluation of tumour-associated mammalian and microbial carbohydrate antigens. In the short to medium term, we plan to conduct basic research in the following areas:

1.Rational design and synthesis of inhibitors for tumour-associated glycosyltransferases;

2.Raising high affinity antibodies against oligosialic acid-based vaccines for the treatment of cancer and prevention of infectious disease

3.Efficient clustering strategies for improving immunogenicity of carbohydrates antigens.

"Both ""active learning"" and ""cost-sensitive learning"" are fast-growing and promising research areas in machine learning. I propose to further my research in these two areas, and to combine the two to foster a new learning paradigm called ""Active Cost-sensitive Learning"" (or ACL for short).  

      Traditional machine learning is ""passive""; that is, the learning program passively learns from the provided training examples. Active learning, on the other hand, actively seeks for extra information (the effort) to improve learning (the gain). Most previous works of active learning treat the ""effort"" and ""gain"" in different terms and do not unify the two. 

      On the other hand, ACL (Active Cost-sensitive Learning) unifies the two aspects of active learning (effort and gain) using cost; that is, we study active learning in the cost-sensitive framework. In the proposed research we will study active learning algorithms that are able to recognize the opportunity to ""buy"" extra information in order to minimize the total cost (or maximize the net benefit). The extra information can include new examples, new class labels, and values of missing attributes in the either training or test datasets. 

      The advantage of studying ACL is that it aims to optimize the business goals of real-world applications. The ultimate goal of such applications is to maximize the net profit or to minimize the total cost. Thus, ACL can be applied to solve a wide range of real-world problems. For example, in medical diagnosis our learning program can actively select a small set of crucial medical tests to reduce the total cost of medical tests and cost of misdiagnosis of patients, thus relieve the financial strain in the medical insurance system, such as OHIP (Ontario Health Insurance Plan). An ACL system of image classification can discover the optimal number of training examples (images) to ""buy"" or collect to reduce the total cost.  Applied to real-world applications, ACL allows Canadian businesses, companies, and society's social services to save money. The impact of the proposed research is therefore very significant.

"SOME prey animals hide from predators. Some run away. Still others counterattack. This research investigates evolutionary and ecological processes leading to variation in prey defences, and the influence of prey defences on an animal's social behaviour, parental care and ecological patterns.

   I will address the question of why some animals appear to altruistically defend individuals that are not their own offspring against predators. Even though examples of selfless behaviour are common in the animal world, we do not expect such behaviour to arise through natural selection. Through previous work with mule deer (a seemingly altruistic animal that defends fawns from another species!), I ruled out the possibility that females defend non-offspring because they mistake them for their own, and the common idea that females only help close relatives so as to pass on their shared genes. I will now test the hypothesis that the defence of non-offspring is a spillover of a female's motivation to defend her own fawn. A rigid response to any distress call may ensure a female defends her own fawn when it is in need, even if it has the drawback of leading her to defend many other animals.

   In another line of research, I will observe natural encounters between predators and prey (coyotes, deer, and two species of ground squirrels) in a prairie landscape to determine how the behaviour and density of prey animals affect a predator's hunting success and its decision to hunt one species of prey rather than another. 

   This research will advance our understanding of the evolution of prey defences and intertwined patterns of social behaviour and parental care. It will also provide insight into the way the behaviour of individual prey and predators shapes survival patterns of prey. This research is applicable to conservation. It will increase our understanding of the way coyotes affect native prey species on Canada's native prairie grassland, a habitat supporting a disproportionate share of endangered species.

"Knowledge acquired from databases may be fragmented for two principal reasons: the databases may be physically stored in different locations distributed on a network, or it may be computationally advantageous to apply a data mining technique to subsets of a massive database. In such cases, combining fragmented knowledge is an important issue. Our long term goal is to combine granular clustering and classification results in a knowledge-oriented network. Granular computing typically encompasses algorithms based on fuzzy, rough, and interval sets, which were initially used in classification problems. Recently, researchers have shown that these three representations are useful for modeling overlapping clusters. Fuzzy clustering makes it possible to specify the degree with which a given object belongs to a cluster, instead of a binary description of the membership. The interval and rough set representations allow us to state that an object may belong to more than one cluster. Our proposals that use interval set representations of clusters have been well received by the research community. These approaches were based on Genetic Algorithms, K-means, and Kohonen Self-organizing Maps. We are also collaborating with other researchers on support vector interval set clustering. These interval set representations are more flexible than the conventional crisp clusters and less verbose than the fuzzy clusters. The distributed pieces of databases in a knowledge-oriented network may differ from each other because they contain different features and/or they contain different objects. For our short term goal, we will focus on databases that differ in features used to represent the objects. These features may be semantically different from each other, such as customer spending and customer visits. Or, they may be the same attributes from different time periods, for example, spending in summer versus spending in winter. When two or more significantly different criteria are used in the classification or clustering, it may be desirable to create separate models for each criteria, and then combine the results. We plan to extend this concept by combining conventional and granular classifications and clustering from different time periods.","Information systems and technology","Information and communication services","Mathematics and Computing Science","Lingras, Pawan","RGPIN ","Knowledge representation","Artificial intelligence","Intelligence artificielle",3-5

"In protein engineering protein's sequence structures are altered by substituting one or more residues on wild type proteins to produce mutants. The mutants often possess different native structures, and exibit different folding and binding behaviors than the original wild type proteins. Computer simulation models have been instrumental in understanding this medically important and scientifically revealing field. However, sophisticated software such as AMBER, CHARMM and GROMACS are too computationally intensive, while simplified Go models requires knowledge of the native structures, which are usually not available for mutants. This project constructs Go model of mutants based on the known (usually) structure of the wild type proteins. The novel method uses advance simulation software to construct the ground state mutant structures, and then employs computationally efficient Go models to study the folding and aggregation (binding) mechanisms of the mutants. If successful, the method will help to guide protein engineering experiments, and lead to designed proteins whose folding speed approach the so-called ""protein folding speed limit"", or to protein systems with altered functional roles.

"The platinum group elements (PGE) have a wide variety of uses, but the most important is as a catalyst for reducing air pollution in automobiles. The demand for PGE around the world will grow as emission standards for automobiles and trucks become more closely controlled. New sources of PGE will need to be found to meet this demand and in turn exploration strategies to discover resources are based on geological models. The Marathon Cu-Pd deposit is a well-know PGE deposit hosted by the Coldwell Intrusive Complex in northwestern Ontario. A new zone of mineralization has recently been discovered at this deposit, the W Horizon. The purpose of the present study is to determine the origin of the mineralization, i.e., can it be explained entirely by magmatic processes (e.g., is the mineralization part of a magma conduit system, were sulphide minerals resorbed by later intrusions) or whether the mineralization was remobilized by hydrothermal fluids. The origin of the mineralization will be established through a detailed petrological, lithogeochemical and mineral chemistry study of one diamond drill hole that cuts the W Horizon, together with supplementary studies of three other drill holes that cut different locations of the W Horizon. The model developed here can then be applied to an exploration strategy for additional resources at the Marathon deposit, elsewhere in the Coldwell Intrusive Complex and at similar intrusions around the world.","Mineral resources ( prospecting, exploration, mining, extraction, processing)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Earth & Environmental Sciences","Linnen, Robert","CRDPJ ","Economic geology","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",1-2
"Understanding the behaviour of metals in magmatic-hydrothermal systems is the key to deciphering the origin of many types of ore deposits. This understanding has improved dramatically in the last few years because of the development of laser ablation induced couple plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses of metals in minerals, fluid inclusions and melts inclusions. The proposed research will take advantage of this technique to study 'rare-metal' (Ta-Nb-Sn-W-Mo) and precious metal (Pt-Pd-Au) ore deposits. The rare-metals are increasingly more important as new uses in electronics and specialty alloys are developed, and because of high prices, the interest in precious metals continues to be strong. It is necessary to better understand of the processes that concentrate these elements in order to improve exploration models. This will be accomplished by field investigations, where the abundances of the ore metals will be determined in fluid and melt inclusions. From these data the relative importance of magmatic versus hydrothermal processes will be evaluated. The field studies will also examine whether characteristic elements are concentrated in key minerals. The spatial and temporal relationships between these indicator minerals and mineralization will be characterized and applied to generating genetic models of ore deposits, and evaluating the use of indicator minerals to exploration of hydrothermal ore deposits. Complementary experimental studies will also be conducted. These include determining the diffusivity of Ta and solubility of tantalum minerals in granitic melts, and the use of synthetic fluid inclusions to study element partitioning, notably Au-As-Sb-Mo-W, between vapour and liquid phases of immiscible fluids.","Mineral resources ( prospecting, exploration, mining, extraction, processing)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Earth & Environmental Sciences","Linnen, Robert","RGPIN ","Economic geology","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",3-5

"This research is critical for maintaining global competitiveness with existing and emerging manufacturing technologies and processes by developing a software infrastructure to assist in increasing desired outputs while reducing time and cost necessary to obtain a deeper level of understanding. An increased rate of learning offers: process yields improvements, performance enhancement, and facility and supply chain optimization. To obtain these goals, one must extract the greatest amount of process knowledge from available data. In many cases, huge amounts of data are collected, but suitable methods for extracting the potential value out of this information is lacking. For example, substanital process data are available for every circuit or MEMS device made in a semiconductor foundry. Alternatively with emerging process technologies such as nanotechnology or biotechnology, little is understood about the different critical factors and ideal settings to optimize product quality and output. Consequently, an analytical platform that identifies and characterizes linear relations, non-linear relations, and the interactions between two or more variables could accelerate: understanding, improvement, application, and commercialization of these processes. 

Direct Kernel Methods (DKM) were developed for and applied to the design of drugs and analysis of Raman spectroscopy. These powerful techniques are relatively indifferent to non-normal data distributions, non-linear relationships, interaction effects, size of data set, and number of dependent variables. My research will start by applying DKM to existing Taguchi DOE and determine what additional insights DKMs can offer over this traditional, but limited technique. Next, analysis will be applied to process data for an emerging technology. Insights obtained using DKMs will be compared to the knowledge obtained from traditional approaches to assess the performance of DKMs. The PI has applied a similar, but less advanced technique for causal modeling in operations management. This grant will support researchers in the Emerging Technology and Innovation Management Laboratory at the University of Ottawa recently funded by CSI/ORF grants.

"My areas of general interest are affective and developmental neuroscience. In relation to the first, I am interested in how human emotions and affects interact with cognitive systems, in particular attention and frontal executive functions, in order to achieve emotional and behavioral self-regulation. My second area of expertise and research investigate how normal development affect cognitive functions, in particular attention and executive control.

This proposal is a direct extension of the work I have been conducting in these two areas.

The first four studies test specific predictions that two components of the event-related potential to negative self-relevant words, the frontally distributed AEP (200-400 ms) and the posteriorly distributed LPP (400-600 msec) will be independently modulated by implicit/covert processing of emotion (the former), and explicit/covert processing of emotion (the latter), independent of stimulus type (words, face expressions, pictures), and will be further enhanced by the induction of a transient induced mood congruent state.

The last study explores the interaction between response inhibition and emotional content.

Understanding of the electrophysiological correlates of early/automatic vs. late/conscious processing of threat information and those of inhibitory control of emotional stimuli has important implications for clinical conditions characterized by hypervigilance to threat and disorders of emotional self-regulation.

"The environmental concerns related to the use of cyanide in the leaching of gold have stimulated considerable efforts to develop more environmentally friendly technologies. Of these thiosulfate appears to be the most promising alternative to cyanidation. However, passivation of gold during leaching from the thiosulfate electrolyte slows down this reaction significantly. It has been observed that certain organic additives such as thiourea, thioacetamide and sulphanilamide significantly improve the dissolution of gold in thiosulfate solutions. The nature of the passivation of gold and the effect of organic additives on leaching of gold in thiosulfate solutions are poorly understood. The objective of research described in this proposal is to employ in situ infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and surface imaging techniques such as atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy to determine the nature of the passive layer and the role of the organic additives. Specifically we will identify the nature of species adsorbed at a gold electrode surface and will determine surface concentrations of these species as a function of the electrode potential and electrolyte composition. We will determine if a complex between Au+ and the organic additive (ligand) is formed at the electrode surface. We will provide information concerning orientation of the adsorbed additive. We will determine the effect of the additive on the rate of gold dissolution and the mechanism of the gold-dissolution reaction. The information provided by this project will be used by Barricks Gold Corporation for the development of new technologies of gold leaching from ores.","Manufacturing processes and products","Manufacturing processes and products",Chemistry,"Lipkowski, Jacek","CRDPJ ",Electrochemistry,"Physical chemistry","Chimie physique",3-3

"Many industrial processes operate in time-varying conditions. Examples are manufacturing cells, robot manipulator motions, CANDU reactor refuelling, mining excavation, and pumping rate changes and valve actuation in mineral processing operations. Transient conditions make equipment condition monitoring and diagnostics difficult; and this variability poses a particular challenge in achieving reliable process performance in complex, integrated plants for extended periods of time. Such plants can have high opportunity costs of lost production associated with equipment faults, process interferences, and maintenance outages, particularly when there is limited inventory or redundancy. Integrated industrial processes will have to rely increasingly on information to maintain process robustness with reduced energy intensity and less intermediate surge capacity, by using process control as well as on-line assessments of system reliability and fault classification for production and maintenance decision-making. For systems that have multiple operating modes and variable operating conditions, there is no general framework for assessing and controlling equipment reliability as a function of process operation. 



The proposed research program in reliability of equipment in time-varying processes considers issues of design and reliable operation of mechanical equipment in complex industrial systems. There is a particular focus on developing methods for characterizing damage mechanisms, identifying faults, and assessing process performance de-rating for machines operating with time-varying loads. Results will be applicable to different sectors, and particularly oil sands bitumen production equipment and systems to improve performance and reliability. These results will also contribute to design and operating guidelines for new production equipment, with the long-term goal of new, more reliable production methods that will further reduce the energy intensity and environmental impact of bitumen production from oil sands.

"This research falls into three distinct areas:

(a) Many modern analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue conversion systems use an architecture known as a sigma-delta modulator.  These nonlinear dynamical systems, which are closely related to noise shapers, display behaviour that can appear to be chaotic, but which is actually completely deterministic.  Nevertheless, only the 1st-order sigma-delta modulator has thus far proved amenable to detailed mathematical analysis.  It is believed that a new insight into their behaviour, resulting from a recent discovery known as the ""integer noise-shaping theorem,"" will allow a mathematical understanding to be achieved for a larger class of such systems.

(b) The mathematical theory of dithered quantization and noise shaping, which we have developed primarily for digital audio applications over the past 20 years, is also applicable to image and video processing.  The full extension of the 1-dimensional audio results to 2-dimensional image processing requires the development of new theorems in the theory of functions of two complex variables -- specifically, the extension of Jensen's theorem, and of the properties of minimum-phase noise shapers, to two dimensions.  This will be the focus of this aspect of our research.

(c) Low-frequency acoustic transducers have diaphragms that undergo excursions large enough that the linearized acoustic wave equation is not sufficiently precise to predict their behaviour.  In particular, a high-frequency transducer in close proximity to such a low-frequency transducer suffers both amplitude- and frequency-modulation effects due to this nonlinearity.  We shall investigate improved models to predict these effects and to control them.

"The objective of this research is to investigate new technologies that are targeted to support autonomic computing in multi-tier heterogeneous sensor networks. Autonomic computing systems are distributed computer systems that can manage themselves and therefore their complexities are invisible to end users. These systems rely heavily on feedback within the network to adapt their behaviour. Unlike sensor networks that simply collect and distribute sensory data to end users, an autonomic sensor network can aggregate and interpret sensory data and make decisions in the network that can affect the collection and routing of data within the network. A multi-tier sensor network is a sensor network that utilizes several different protocols; typically one layer will leverage Internet-based protocols (a SensorWeb) while the other layers use protocols

customized for the particular network.

With this high-level research objective in mind, several key research directions will be investigated. These are: the use of policy languages as a mechanism to facilitate customization and programming within sensor networks; the use of semantic knowledge to enable seamless inter operation between distributed sensor domains; support of sensory plug and play capabilities; and access control models for highly distributed sensor systems. A key challenge in all of these research directions is the interoperability between the sensor network layers, in particular the use of Internet-based protocols within resource constraint wireless sensor networks.","Information systems and technology","Information and communication services","Engineering and Applied Science, Faculty of","Liscano, Ramiro","RGPIN ","Distributed and parallel processing","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",1-5

"Protecting the environment through infrastructure that supports modern society is critical to providing a safe and high quality of life; and is a particularly important goal for Civil Engineering. My NSERC-supported research explores the interface of microbiology and engineered systems for biological wastewater treatment.  The goal is to better integrate knowledge of biological, chemical and physical characteristics of microbial structures (flocs and films) and their behaviour, that are associated with traditional suspended growth systems, and advanced technologies based on fixed-film processes. The specific objectives include: i) advancing the understanding the role of particular glycoconjugates and adhesin proteins associated with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of floc and in microbial interfaces; ii) elucidating factors affecting floc and film properties in the suspended and attached populations in integrated fixed film activated sludge (IFAS) systems; iii) achieving a better understanding of the microenvironment in aerated-membrane bioreactor biofilms, particularly with respect to electrochemical gradients (oxygen and redox) and EPS, in relation to biofilm properties and stability at the membrane-film interface; and iv) training of research students in environmental engineering and environmental biotechnology, and the transfer of novel tools and approaches to the investigation and development of advanced environmental technology. We employ both bench-scale and pilot-scale systems designed to simulate wastewater treatment processes and are run under well-controlled conditions in specific ways to influence floc and film properties.  Consultation with engineers and operators will enable us to integrate this approach with the experience of full-scale systems of different configurations. We continue to build upon our biochemical and molecular tools developed in our laboratory to advance the importance of physicochemical properties of microbial structures, and uniquely employ advanced optical microscopy (confocal imaging, atomic force microscopy and Raman confocal imaging) and high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy that permits us to establish structure-function relationships.

"Load-bearing masonry is most often used to resist in-plane loads, thus efficient and safe design of these structural members is very important.  While many theories for the failure and shear strength of masonry under in-plane loading have been proposed and investigated, a consensus has not been reached and the current state of knowledge remains unsatisfactory.  The overall aim of the proposed research is to explore various aspects of in-plane shear in masonry with the expected outcomes being improvements in guidance for both the testing and design of these important structural elements.



The proposed research is multi-faceted, beginning with development of a database containing all in-plane shear test results (masonry assemblages and material tests) reported in the literature.  This database will be an invaluable tool, not only for the proposed research, but for all current and future researchers in this area.  The various equations that exist for predicting the in-plane shear strength of masonry will be evaluated for their reliability and level of safety by employing stochastic and probabilistic methods.  By careful evaluation of existing equations and probable modifications thereof, the results of the proposed work are expected to result in improvement to the fundamental understanding of in-plane shear providing numerous benefits to researchers, designers, contractors, and infrastructure owners in terms of better design standards and thus more efficient structures.  Various masonry in-plane shear test methods will also be evaluated with the aim of providing guidance on a possible standardised shear test method.  This suggested test method will be used to produce further results for the database and verification of the proposed equation.  In addition, it will be used to evaluate the performance of masonry shear walls reinforced with alternative materials that are recyclable (e.g. geo-textiles, GFRP) and/or rapidly renewable (e.g. bamboo).  The results will be important not only for Canadian masonry construction but also for developing regions where safe, low-cost housing is sorely needed.

"The Industrial Research Chair in Nuclear Engineering at the University of New Brunswick ran for 15 years until 2008, having been renewed twice.  During that time it built a solid national and international reputation for innovative research into the chemistry and corrosion of cooling systems in power plants.  The current award of a collaborative research and development grant is for an extension of those activities, but with a modified focus.  Thus, the Canadian nuclear industry through the CANDU Owners Group, which along with NSERC sponsors the research, has moved the funding vehicle from a committee that is integrated primarily in the corrosion of piping in the CANDU primary coolant system to their more general R&D area.  The research pursued will seek to improve our understanding of the way materials that make up the cooling systems of power plants - mostly, but not exclusively, nuclear - corrode and how the resulting corrosion product oxides are transported around the circuits.  Methods to mitigate the corrosion and the subsequent problems of fouling and loss of efficiency of heat transfer surfaces, build-up of radioactivity on out-reactor components, etc., are likely outcomes.","Nuclear energy","Energy resources","Chemical Engineering","Lister, Derek","CRDPJ ","Transport processes","Chemical engineering","G�nie chimique",2-5
"The software industry is faced with one main challenge:  the high cost of software maintenance and operation.  One of the main reasons for this is the usage and operation complexity of the software, together with its lack of run-time flexibility and adaptability to the workload and environment conditions. There seems to be two complementary solutions to this problem: adaptive and self-managing systems and software as a service computing model.



The goal of this research program is to investigate methods, patterns, algorithms, architectures and methodologies that lead to adaptive software systems in the context of software as a service. Adaptive and self-managing software is software that can easier adapt to changes in user requirements, is more autonomic, more evolvable, that is software that can be easier upgraded, released and deployed. We are looking at the entire lifecycle of the software:  analysis, modeling, development, deployment, operation as well as to specific run-time artifacts that enable adaptive systems. A specific goal of the research program is the advancement of model based feedback computing, in which the adaptation and self-management decisions are based on a model of the software. The models capture specific quality aspects such as performance or reliability or can capture partial functionality of the systems.

"Currently we have mobile robots that can map their environs both indoors and outdoors, and then reliably recover their metric position while moving around in their space by solving the well-known simultaneous localization and mapping problem (SLAM).  But robots cannot yet tell us where they are, nor easily take our directions.  



Bridging the gap between dense accurate geometric information and the semantics of the space we share with robots is the critical next step in building usable robotic assistants.  



I will investigate how to supply a world description to the robot, learned from examples or adopted from ontologies that characterize prototypical spaces.   The relations between places and robots support our interactions with them and enable robots to work with us.  Moreover, I will ground descriptions in robust visual features that identify particular locations, to which place identifiers are associated.



Assistive technology, in particular stereo-guided wheelchairs, is an application where stereo sensing-based mapping technology can sense obstacles and nearby walking patients.  Moreover, vision can provide situation awareness, by giving information about contexts and activities, beyond simple geometric occupancy maps.  



Recently our mobile robotics group teamed with David Lowe's group in recognition to create ""Curious George"", a mobile robot for the  semantic Robot Vision challenge at AAAI 2007.  The robot learns to find objects in a room from Web images.  Our next generation robots will use maps to guide viewpoint selection and use context to find objects, and assist people in everyday tasks.

"We are requesting the Hoverguard 700 to provide a research operating platform that allows safe access to challenging field sites. This hovercraft can be used on saltwater, freshwater, ice, mud and in saltmarshes, and will support three research programs. Dr. Litvak will use this vehicle to access overwintering sites of sturgeon in the Saint John River. Finding and describing these sites is important because during winter sturgeons reduce activity and aggregate, allowing for accurate population estimates. Currently, Dr. Litvak and his students are restricted to searching for overwintering sites during a short period when there is sufficient ice cover. The hovercraft expands the potential of his research and will lead to a more precise estimate of the populations of these threatened species. Dr. Hamilton, in collaboration with Dr. Barbeau, studies intertidal mudflat community ecology.  Much of her research focuses on interactions between the amphipod Corophium volutator, its invertebrate predators and competitors, and migrating Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla).  C. volutator is central to the mudflat ecosystem and is an essential food resource for these birds when they are present in the upper Bay of Fundy. A clear understanding of the dynamics of C. volutator populations is important in both community-ecological and conservation contexts. The Hovercraft will allow us to sample mudflats more completely and efficiently, and to reach muddy shores that are currently inaccessible. Dr. Barbeau also studies salt marshes which are characterized by tough, salt-tolerant grasses which grow on soils that are regularly covered by tidal water. They are very productive ecosystems that serve a number of critical environmental functions, such as storing carbon, filtering pollution, providing nursery habitat to a diversity of organisms, and sheltering coasts from sea level rise or storm activity. The ecology of salt marshes has been extensively studied in southern climates, but in northern climates, particularly in areas with severe, icy winters, there is much that remains unknown about the basic ecological processes at work in the salt marsh.  The Hovercraft platform will afford much greater access to these important and relatively poorly-studied areas.

"Although records suggest that sturgeon have been important to humans for 1000's of years, we still know little of the history of their fisheries, importance and basic ecology. Today, sturgeons are persecuted throughout most of their ranges. Production of sturgeon products through aquaculture may provide an opportunity to protect the remaining stocks, while providing economic growth in Canada and around the world. Currently, aquaculture production of caviar exceeds wild harvest. However, sale of illegally caught caviar that has been labeled as an aquaculture product continues to damage wild stocks and affect the growth of the sturgeon aquaculture industry. There needs to be a set of tools developed which will allow enforcement groups within nation states to certify the origin of caviar and other sturgeon products. Here, we propose a series of experiments and

activities using advanced stable isotope analyses to examine the historical and current uses of sturgeons. First, we plan to develop the isotopic signatures of sturgeon products from aquaculture and those from the wild. We intend this information to be used by industry and government to develop a sturgeon product registry to provide certification of authenticity for aquaculture derived products for export and import. This will greatly increase both consumer confidence and therefore greater opportunities for product export. The use of isotope analysis of wild fish is also of importance to managing the remaining stocks of sturgeon, as little information about their distribution, life history and habitat use is known. Remains of sturgeons have been found in a number of First Peoples' archaeological sites in Canada. The integration of advanced isotopic elemental analysis with information about sturgeon ecology and archaeological signatures for paleodiet will allow First Peoples to learn

more about the nature of their subsistence economy and commerce during the last 4000 years. This project will provide a comprehensive approach to sturgeon ecology and aquaculture that will ensure that Canada remains a leader in aquaculture, conservation, and species management. In addition, the isotope data gleaned from these sturgeon remains will also provide a rare opportunity to examine climate change over the last 4000 years.",Aquaculture,"Agriculture and primary food production","Biology (Saint John)","Litvak, Matthew","STPGP ","Animal biology","Animal biology","Biologie animale",1-3
"Most species of fish produce many eggs (r-selected). For example, a female winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) can produce up to 3 million eggs per year and is reproductive for an average of 7 years. However, very few embryos survive to reproduction. Mortality rates for these r-selected species, both in field and aquaculture settings, are extremely high during the first year of life.  This life-history strategy is of fundamental importance to our understanding of fish population dynamics and a significant challenge to aquaculture development. Together with my students, I study ecology and behaviour of fishes during these important early life stages. I propose to continue my research in five areas: 1) effects of yolk and lipid quantity and quality on larval size and performance, 2) importance of maternal and paternal contributions to offspring variability in size and performance, 3) heritability of these traits, 4) effects of abiotic factors on growth and survival and their interactions with areas 1 through 3, and 5) development of spatial ecological models of egg, larval and juvenile distributions.  Over the past few years my lab has developed a number of advanced tools to investigate the effects of genotype on performance traits (phenotype) of fishes. We developed the first successful microinjection system to control size and constituents of yolk reserves in fish embryos. We also recently developed efficient sperm cryopreservation protocols for winter flounder, cod and haddock. These two advances provide us with the opportunity to examine the relative contributions of the parents to offspring performance. While these biotic factors are extremely important, we also have to understand how abiotic (physical) factors may affect them. We will continue to conduct laboratory-based experiments to provide information on how abiotic factors (such as temperature), relevant to ecology and aquaculture, affect fish growth and survival.  This data will be used with field analyses to study where fish go and why. This aspect of spatial ecology provides a key link between small-scale laboratory experiments and the study of wild populations.

"I am requesting funds to purchase equipment to house lab colonies of snakes.  The snakes will be used as study organisms in my research program.  There are two components to my research program: applied field work that focuses on the spatial ecology, critical habitat identification, and recovery of turtle species at risk; and basic science that focuses on variation in life history, maternal investment, and physiological-ecology of reptiles.  The applied component of my research program has been successful because that work has been relatively well funded.  However, my ability to address some basic life history questions has been somewhat limited by my study systems: species-at-risk turtles in the field.  I would like to establish lab colonies of two readily-available species of North American Colubrid snakes (Corn Snakes and Garter Snakes) in order to better address questions about maternal investment and energetic tradeoffs in vertebrate ectotherms.  I am requesting funds from NSERC to support the advancement of my research program in this new lab-based direction.  With lab colonies, I will have greater sample sizes and therefore greater statistical power.  The lab snakes will allow me to directly manipulate energy availability using various feeding treatments, seasonality using incubators, etc, and to thereby directly test the effects of these factors on growth rate, body condition, reproductive frequency, and maternal investment.

"The last several years has witnessed tremendous growth in both research and applications of unmanned aerial

vehicles (UAVs) and Multi-UAVs (MUAVs). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are of great interest in

military and civilian applications, including mapping, patrolling, surveillance, and search and rescue using

on-board digital cameras. Many of these tasks are both repetitive and dangerous, making them ideal

applications for autonomous vehicles [14]. Groups of UAVs are of special interest due the potential for

simultaneous coverage of large areas, or cooperation to achieve a common goal. In the proposed research, we

plan to address several key elements of MUAV technology, leading to significant advances in the operation of

MUAV systems such as mission duration, image quality, and operator workload. The major thrust of the

proposed research is focussed towards development of an automated MUAV system, capable of accomplishing

far more surveillance in the same time as a single UAV, thereby reducing the required mission time.

Improvements in individual UAV attitude and location sensing will allow highly automated MUAV operation,

reducing operator workload substantially. Enhanced UAV aerodynamic control will allow substantial

improvements in image quality, allowing 3D images to be generated from images obtained from individual

UAV and visual UAV servo control, allowing UAVs to fly near objects of interest under automatic control.

The proposed autonomous MUAV system has strong potential in the Safety and Security applications. The

vision system onboard each UAV provides mobile aerial surveillance for dynamic detection and identification;

multiple UAVs simultaneous provide coverage of large areas and their coordination provides the capability of

monitoring disaster scenarios such as forest fire detection; the autonomous feature allows for automated target

tracking. Further, the multiple UAV system itself provides redundancy and safe-failure and fault tolerance by

adaptation and reconfiguration within the group.",Aerospace,"Transportation systems and services","Aerospace Studies, Institute for","Liu, Hugh","STPGP ","Aerospace, aeronautical and automotive engineering","Mechanical engineering","G�nie m�canique",3-3
"On one hand, a cooperative system is a collection of dynamical objects which communicate and cooperate in order to achieve a common or shared objective. It has strong potential with a wide range of applications in robotics, medicine, commercial transportation, emergency search-and-rescue operations and national defense. On the other hand, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been identified as potentially valuable resources and the autonomy and cooperation among multiple UAVs are recognized as key capabilities for utilizing the full potential of UAV systems. Systems of this nature assume a hierarchical structure to coordinate information flow, decision-making strategy and individual actions. Therefore, it poses significant theoretical and technical challenges. 



The proposed research program aims at addressing these challenges in two directions. From vertical architecture point of view, a mobile mission planning and decision-making agent is deployed to oversee and coordinate with multiple UAVs to increase optimization and enhance autonomous flight. From horizaontal mission point of view, the cooperation concept is extended to coordination and competition to address complexity in environment and increase intelligence of the participating UAVs.



While there have been numerous publications detailing specialized approaches to cooperation problems, general control and optimization methodologies are only beginning to emerge. My research work and proposed approaches will contribute towards the ultimate goal of fully understanding of the general principles underlying cooperative systems, and achievement of optimization and autonomy in their applications.

"With rapid and widespread deployment of broadband and wireless communication infrastructures, audio/visual multimedia services are becoming increasingly popular among network users. Yet, given the limited network and server resources, and the best-effort nature of the IP network, the user experience with networked media services is still far from satisfactory, particularly during peak hours. Furthermore, the Internet has evolved into an ultra-large and heterogeneous network. Even the dominant client/server communication paradigm has shifted to a mix with peer-to-peer communications. We thus ask the following critical question: how can we distribute quality media content to a large population of highly heterogeneous clients seamlessly through diverse network infrastructures? 

To achieve the ultimate goals of ""anytime-anywhere"" media distribution, technology advances in various aspects need to be re-examined and jointly utilized under a coherent framework. In this proposed long-term research, we will address the above challenges, particularly on media over novel delivering architectures (e.g., peer-to-peer) and network infrastructures (e.g., wireless mesh networks). We will focus not only on the opti- mization of individual components, ranging from server optimization, flow and error control, to peer-to-peer overlay construction and handoff management, but also on their interactions that pose additional challenges to designers. A thorough understanding of the modules in this complex system as well as their interactions will facilitate the development of such popular applications as IPTV, movie-on-demand, video conferencing, and online games - all are essentials in the emerging digital entertainment/business world. 

Beyond the traditional media streaming, we will also examine the new generation of user-generated video sharing services, as represented by YouTube. We will conduct an in-depth study to understand and utilize their unique social networks for videos and users. This includes exploring the correlations among the videos/users to improve cache hit-ratio, designing smart pre-fetch strategies, and implementing novel inter-video overlays.

"The main objective of this research is to develop a state-of-the-art optical system that can non-intrusively measure three-dimensional (3-D) internal soil deformation using transparent soil. Transparent soil is made of amorphous silica with a pore fluid having the same refractive index. It exhibits strength and deformation behaviour similar to natural soil and has been used by many researchers in various geotechnical studies. The objectives of this research are threefold: 1) to develop a 3-D deformation measurement system; 2) to better understand the development of soil deformation during cone penetration; and 3) to advance soil-structure interaction modelling using transparent soil. The ultimate goal is to apply the developed system to understand fundamental behaviour of the soil mass. 

Visualization of 3-D internal soil deformation can significantly improve our understanding of geotechnical problems and provide engineers with information that is normally not accessible from two-dimensional graphs. Nowadays, the soil deformation measurements are intrusive and discrete. The proposed system can eliminate the intrusion of soil sensors and provide a spatial internal deformation measurement instead of surface deformation. It consists of a laser to illuminate the targeted area inside the model and two well-configured cameras to simultaneously capture the laser speckle images. The 3-D internal deformation fields are restructured from 2-D image planes using a stereo particle image velocity (PIV) technique, which has been successfully used in many engineering fields.  

The 3-D soil deformation during cone penetration test will be visualized in this research. The deformation mechanism of the soil mass during cone penetration will also be analyzed. Finite element analyses will be carried out to evaluate the performance of the whole system and transparent soil modelling. 

This research also features advanced experiments to train highly qualified personnel for their career developments in academia and industry in Canada.

"In most vertebrate species including amphibians and mammals, fully grown oocytes undergo maturation to become eggs immediately prior to ovulation. The key event of oocyte maturation is to reduce the number of chromosomes to produce a haploid female genome so that upon fertilization the new embryos will resume a diploid state. The oocyte undergoes chromosome reduction by a special form of cell division to discard half the chromosomes as a non-viable cell (polar body). Accurate segregation of chromosomes is clearly essential for producing functional eggs. However, oocyte maturation is thought to also include the accumulation of many proteins and metabolites essential for oocyte health. Oocytes of poor health exhibit high incidence of embryo fragmentation upon fertilization in both mouse and in human and is strongly associated with pre-implantation embryonic death. The identities of these proteins and metabolites are largely unknown. We have been studying oocyte maturation using the amphibian Xenopus laevis as a vertebrate model organism for the many experimental advantages over mammalian species. We have discovered that the amphibian oocytes produced massive amounts of an enzyme called ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) during maturation. ODC breaks down ornithine (an amino acid) to putrescine, an essential cell metabolite whose exact function remains unclear. We found that when ODC production was inhibited, the oocytes completed polar body extrusion. However, the mature eggs exhibited sign of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and the resultant embryos were fragmented. We propose to investigate the role of ODC in oocyte maturation in mammals, using the mouse model.

"Biosensors are important tools for disease diagnosis and environmental monitoring. Protein enzymes and antibodies are the traditional molecules of choice for biosensor design. In recent years, however, aptamers are emerging as a useful alternative. Aptamers are single-stranded nucleic acids that can bind target molecules with high affinity and specificity. Compared to antibodies, aptamers have similar or better binding performance, but are lower in cost, higher in stability, and easier to modify. With all these attributes, however, no aptamer is currently used in practical disease diagnosis. The Principal Investigator (PI) aims to push practical applications of aptamers by understanding fundamental molecular interactions in aptamer binding, developing new aptamer selection methods for important metabolites and environmental contaminants, and performing detections in serum and environmental samples. In aptamer selection, a critical step is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which allows exponential amplification of DNA sequences with desired binding properties. Real time PCR is the state-of-the-art technique for monitoring the PCR process and thus is highly valuable for optimization of PCR conditions and troubleshooting. The PI's group needs to optimize PCR conditions on a daily basis and this real time PCR thermocycler can increase the productivity of the research group significantly. A possible delay in acquiring this instrument will have a large adverse effect on the PI's group, especially at its early development stage. Students will be trained to use this instrument and become experts in this technique. Trained students will be qualified for positions in analytical laboratories, biotechnological companies and in academics. The research is likely to produce useful sensors that can improve health care, environmental protection, and the quality of life.

"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a peptide hormone mainly produced from the liver. Other tissues also generate IGF-I at lower and variable levels. As its name accurately reflects, traditionally, IGF-I has two major biological functions: promoting cell growth (growth factor) and regulating glucose metabolism (insulin-like). For that, it is potentially useful to expand pancreatic islets (growth) and to replace insulin (metabolism) in both types of diabetes mellitus. However, some recent reports have challenged this notion and raised more questions on how IGF-I might act in these two aspects. The applicant has been working on IGF-I transgenic mice for 6 years and contributed significantly to this on-going debate. In this proposal, I propose to use a robust, general yet pancreatic islet-enriched overexpression to study the effects of IGF-I on pancreatic islet cell growth, cell death, insulin secretion in response to glucose and hepatic glucose production. The research will lead to better understanding of IGF-I physiology which will serve as a solid basis for us to develop IGF-I-based diabetic interventions. For instance, we may have to activate glucose-stimulated signals in order to achieve an adequate response in islet cell growth to IGF-I treatment.

"Research Objectives:

1) To longitudinally establish differentiating spectral features that distinguish between progressing and stable

chronic periodontitis lesions (sensitivity, specificity and robustness) using a recently developed near infrared

(NIR) intraoral probe (supported by a previous CHRP grant).

2) To establish and characterize an animal model (rabbit) for periodontitis that simulates the major features of

the disease in humans in order to elucidate relationships between the spectroscopic measurements and

histopathological alterations at different stages of the disease; and

3) To evaluate the potential of high frequency ultrasound as a direct morphological probe for the in vivo

measurement and imaging of periodontal pocket formation.

Scientific Approach:

1) Human subjects: A total of 500 subjects will be recruited from those with chronic periodontitis who are

undergoing maintenance treatment at three independent locations (Canada, USA and China). Annual clinical

assessment including bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depths (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and

alveolar bone loss will be measured at one or more diseased sites. In vivo NIR spectra will be collected using a

custom built intraoral NIRS system and in vitro Mid IR spectra of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) will be

collected from diseased and control sites. In addition, a handheld 50MHz acoustical microscope will be

employed to examine the areas of soft tissue detachment and pocket depth.

2) Rabbit model: Experimental periodontitis will be produced in New Zealand White rabbits (n=10) by

ligature placement. Histological parameters including HE, TRAP and MMPs of the experimental periodontitis

will be determined. Spectroscopic, ultrasonic, and clinical (POB, PD, CAL) measurements will be carried out

on sedated rabbits simultaneously.

Innovativeness and significance:

Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease initiated by bacterial accumulation that leads to loss of

tooth-supporting tissues and resorption of alveolar bone. However, current diagnostic procedures do not

reliably identify susceptible individuals nor distinguish between disease-active and disease inactive sites.

Recently, we have demonstrated that optical spectroscopy (supported by previous CHRP grant) can be used to

measure regional tissue hemodynamics and edema - a potential new novel tool for the diagnosis of

periodontitis, as we originally hypothesized (Liu et al, J. Periodont. Res. 2008).

The innovativeness of the current proposal lies in capitalizing on the breakthroughs achieved in our previous

CHRP grant. The current proposal will perform the next set of studies required to bridge laboratory findings to

clinical implementation. We plan to execute a ""3 M"" strategy- Multicenter (Canada, USA, China), Multimodel

(Human and animal), and Multimodality (Near-infrared spectroscopy, Mid-infrared spectroscopy and

Ultrasonic imaging).

The success of this anticipated CHRP grant will provide essential pre-clinical data (a) longitudinal

assessment of disease progression by infrared modalities; (b) associations of spectroscopic results to the

histopathological alterations associated with periodontitis (animal model); and (c) the development of a further

innovative imaging tool (ultrasonic microprobing) that will permit comparisons of in vivo digital images of the

periodontal soft tissue with infrared-derived inflammatory indices. The development, regulatory approval and

marketing of a non-invasive diagnostic suite will provide a much-needed screening and diagnostic and

prognostic tool for inflammatory periodontal diseases that will represent a major breakthrough for the field of

dental medicine in Canada and beyond.","Not available","Not available",Pathology,"Liu, KanZhi","CHRPJ ","Biomedical engineering","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",1-3

"This project concerns the development of reagent schemes to efficiently recover niobium oxide minerals from their ores, and to remove manganese from iron ores.



Niobium is an extremely useful element.  When added to stainless steels, it improves their mechanical strength and corrosion-and temperature-resistance.  When alloyed with zirconium, it can be used as wires for superconducting magnets.  It should be recovered from the limited number of ores with maximum efficiency.  However, due to a lack of specific niobium mineral flotation collectors, currently only generic collectors such as amines are used to recover the niobium minerals from their ores.  This results in complex process flowsheet and heavy losses of the niobium minerals to the tailings, e.g., currently the Niobec Mine in Quebec only recovers 61-63% of the niobium minerals from the ore.  In this research, specific collectors for niobium oxide minerals will be developed using Niobec ore samples, which are expected to significantly simplify the flowsheet and increase niobium mineral recovery.



At Wabush Mines, the manganese content varies from 0.5% to 5% Mn depending on the mining areas.  Existing gravity concentration which is typically used in upgrading iron ores and high tension separation cannot reject manganese.  The North American steelmakers Mn specifications (about 0.4% Mn) restrict the mined iron ore deposits to those ones with less than 2% of manganese only at Wabush.  This research will develop an effective flotation reagent scheme to selectively float away the Mn oxide minerals from the iron ore concentrate, which will make the iron ores more suitable to markets and significantly increase the mine life at Wabush Mines.  The results will also benefit other iron ore mines with high Mn contents.

"The long-term goal of this research program is to study the molecular mechanisms of translational control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein. To understand the mechanisms by which HCV nonstructural protein-5A (NS5A) affects HCV protein translation is the short-term goal of this proposal. We plan to test the hypothesis that HCV NS5A protein regulates HCV protein translation through interaction with the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) and by modulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Research will focus on three objectives.

1) HCV NS5A is a newly identified RNA binding protein with a preference of binding to 3'-UTR.  NS5A protein has three structural/functional domains.  NS5A is present as basal and hyper-phosphorylated forms.  The first objective will (i) map the domains and amino acid residues of NS5A involved in RNA binding; and (ii) study the effect of NS5A hyper-phosphorylation in modulating NS5A binding to 3'-UTR RNA. 

2) In the second objective, we will characterize the role of NS5A-3'UTR RNA binding in regulating HCV protein translation.  We will use the knowledge obtained from the first objective to design experiments to study the effect of NS5A 3'-UTR RNA binding on HCV protein translation. We will use a novel experimental system developed by us (J Clin Virol, 40:55, 2007). 

3) In the third objective, we will study the impact of PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways modulated by HCV NS5A expression on HCV protein translation.  We will use genetic and pharmacological approaches to address this issue. 

This proposal will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HCV translational control by HCV NS5A.  This proposal will be performed entirely by two graduate students and thus contribute to the training of highly qualified personnel.

We will automatically determine source locations and mechanisms for major global earthquakes in real time based upon simulations of seismic wave propagation in a 3D global tomography model. We also enhance our knowledge of the earth structure by forming the tomography inverse problem based upon adjoint methods and the setup of 3D numerical simulations. We will take advantage of the abundant broadband seismic data, choose the proper inversion techniques, and produce new generation tomographic images that will shed light on the geodynamical and tectonical processes deep inside the earth.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Physics,"Liu, Qinya","RGPIN ",Seismology,Geophysics,"G�ophysique",1-5
"Stellite and Tribaloy alloys display astounding hardness, toughness, and high temperature strength, and are usually highly resistant to corrosion. They are commonly used for wear resistance and sometimes in corrosive environments or/and at elevated temperatures. In many cases of industrial application one or more attributes of these alloys may be more important than the others, or many attributes may be important simultaneously. For example, the Stellite and Tribaloy alloys used for various dies require moderate ductility in addition to wear resistance. However, improvements in one attribute are often accomplished at the expense of other desirable material properties. For instance, increasing wear resistance of a material often results in reduced toughness, weldability, and corrosion resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the chemical composition so as to achieve a best combination of the required attributes of the alloy for a designated application. In this research, three groups of new Stellite and Tribaloy alloys will be designed and developed to meet various industrial needs through optimizing the chemical compositions. The first group is extra hard Stellite alloys; the second group is wear resistant and tough Stellite alloys; and the third group is tungsten containing Tribaloy alloys. The developed alloys will be characterized using hardness tests, tensile tests, fatigue tests, abrasive wear tests, erosion tests and corrosion tests. Since Stellite and Tribaloy alloys usually serve at elevated temperatures, and so the high-temperature properties of these new alloys are important and will be determined under various tests. The significance of this research lies in the application of the fundamentals of materials science and advanced technologies to developing an important class of industrial materials having significant practical value. The developed alloys with superior attributes will benefit not only the industrial partner, Deloro Stellite Inc., but also a wide range of engineering such as oil production, aerospace mechanical and mechanical industries. This work will create both industrial and economic benefits, because made of these new materials the components and machine will rend high performance and extended service life, thus leading to cost-saving.","Materials performance","Construction, urban and rural planning","Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering","Liu, Rong","CRDPJ ","Materials structure, properties and testing","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",2-3
"Hard coatings are increasingly used to improve the tribological performance and corrosion resistance of advanced engineering components, for example, gas turbine blades and combustion chambers. Generally, coating failures occur in two modes: (1) interfacial failure or delamination such that the coating layer spalls off the substrate; and (2) coating fracture. In either way, the coating loses its function of protection, thus the component life may be reduced significantly. While many studies have focused on coating/substrate interfacial delamination, the proposed research is to investigate coating fracture based on the mechanics of point-indentation microfracture. The point-indentation technique was originally developed to characterize a material's hardness or resistance to yield. Later, it was also found to be an effective means to characterize fracture toughness of brittle materials. Since most coating materials are brittle, it is expected that this approach can be applied for coating strength evaluation. In this research, indentation tests will be conducted on various coatings (varying thickness and materials) to investigate their cracking behaviors, combining with the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observation. An analytical approach to the mechanics of point-indentation microfracture of coatings will be developed. The effects of coating thickness and the interface on the cracking pattern will be concerned. Two steps will be involved in the analytical solution: (1) determine the stress field beneath the loaded indenter in a coating in terms of the solution of an elastic half-space subjected to a normal point load, because among the three principal normal stresses, the tensile stress field will predetermine the ultimate history of brittle fracture in an elastically loaded coating, and (2) quantify the scale of the micro-cracking in terms of the applied load and thus derive an expression for the stress intensity factor in terms of the indenter load and characteristic crack dimension. The ultimate goal of this research will develop an indentation based method to evaluate the fracture toughness of coatings through crack length and geometry measurements.",Aerospace,"Transportation systems and services","Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering","Liu, Rong","RGPIN ","Modelling, simulation and finite element methods","Mechanical engineering","G�nie m�canique",3-5

"Our ultimate objective is to study the representations of an artin algebra. More specifically, we shall work in the following topics. 



Firstly, we want to study Auslander-Reiten theory in a Krull-Schmidt category. That is, we want to know when the Auslander-Reiten sequences exist and to describe the shapes of the Auslander-Reiten components in case they exist. 



Secondly, we shall study the derived category of an algebra in the following aspects: to characterize the indecomposable complexes, to determine its type, and to describe the Auslander-Reiten components. Moreover, we are interested in classifying the algebras whose derived categories are of finite type (up to shift) or discrete type.



Thirdly, we want to attack some well-known homological conjectures such as the no loop conjecture, the Cartan determinant conjecture, and the strong no loop conjecture. For a partial solution, we wish to settle the last two conjectures for stratified algebras. For this, we shall make use of the method of matrix reduction introduced by Zacharia for dealing with algebras of global dimension two. 

 

Finally, we shall work on a well-known conjecture saying that a finite dimensional algebra is tame if all but finitely many indecomposable modules (up to isomorphism) of any given dimension are invariant under the Auslander-Reiten translation. Our strategy is to introduce the graded bimodule problems which are in bijection with layered bocses so that their categories of representations are equivalent.

"Thermoplastic polymers such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) and polypropylene are flexible, resilient, durable, and resist biological degradation. It is these properties that make such polymers desirable for medical uses such as surgical drapes, sutures, vascular grafts and ligament prostheses. However, the hydrophobic surfaces of these polymers can cause medical complications such as thrombosis when their use brings them in contact with blood, or when they are implanted into the human body. Often certain specific applications, such as surgical drapes, will require specialized functions such as antimicrobial surfaces to decrease the possibility of cross-infection in hospitals. Therefore, surface property engineering to either add functions to the substrate polymers or to improve their biocompatibility becomes an important task in the field of medical textiles, biomaterials and biomedical science. The proposed study will develop a novel non-destructive, effective and efficient modification technique for chemically inert thermoplastic polymers. Polymers with functional groups, such as hydroxyls, will be immobilized onto the surfaces of thermoplastic polymers by the formation of an interpenetrating network. To further engineer the surface property, polymer brush architectures can be attached to the surface using a ""grafting from"" technique after converting the immobilized functional group into proper co-initiator or initiator. Experimental techniques will be explored for the characterization of the formed interpenetrating network and the results correlated to the immobilization efficiency and surface property of the modified materials. The proposed study will lead to a breakthrough in the science of surface modification of chemically inert polymeric materials, which is essential for their applications as medical textiles, biomaterials, and medical devices. The results of the studies can also be used to provide technical support to industries providing protective equipments, medical devices and biomaterials. The proposed work will lead to the training of highly qualified personnel with interdisciplinary skills in Polymer Chemistry, Analytic Chemistry, Medical Textile and Biomaterial Science.

"Parametric nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models have been widely used in longitudinal studies such as HIV viral dynamics, pharmacokinetic analyses, and studies of growth and decay. These parametric NLME models, however, may not be flexible enough in modeling complex longitudinal data, so semiparametric/nonparametric NLME models have been proposed.



In many longitudinal studies, the inter-individual variation usually receives great attention and this variation may be partially explained by time-dependent covariates, but some covariates may be measured with substantial errors and may contain missing values as well. It is very common that some individuals may drop out of the study before the scheduled end for various reasons such as drug intolerance. In addition, the response may be subject to left censoring due to a detection limit. Moreover, there often exists an individual-specific time-to-event process such as time to dropout or time to death. Thus, existing standard complete-data methods are not applicable. 



I have considered approximate likelihood inference for semiparametric NLME models with dropouts and covariate measurement errors and missing data. Two approximate likelihood methods are proposed to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of all model parameters. Asymptotic properties of the resulting estimates have been studied. In the future, I plan to develop the statistical methodology to address dropouts, censoring, time-to-event, measurement errors, and missing covariates simultaneously. Most of the proposed methods are extensions and modifications of my recently proposed methods. Specifically, I use Monte-Carlo methods to simulate missing and censoring data and then employ standard complete-data methods for likelihood inference, with missing values replaced by simulated values.

"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have exceptional mechanical and physical properties, including extremely high strength and elastic modulus not matched by any known materials, and excellent thermal and electrical conductivities.  These properties make CNTs attractive as reinforcement for composite materials.  Also, the significant progress in producing CNTs in large quantity and lower cost is helping to break the cost barrier for the application of CNTs.  The objective of this research is to develop aluminium matrix nanocomposites reinforced with CNTs to improve the mechanical and physical properties.  



Although polymer matrix composites reinforced with CNTs have been widely studied with promising results, CNTs reinforced metal matrix composites have been rarely explored due to the many challenges.  These include homogeneously dispersing the CNTs in the matrix, maintaining the integrity of the CNTs during materials processing, and how to form a strong bond between CNTs and the metal matrix.  In the proposed research, aluminium matrix composites with CNT reinforcement will be developed.  The research will include the development of (1) the formulation for the Al/CNTs composites, (2) a semisolid fabrication process for the composites, including the use different methods for enhancing homogeneous distributions of CNTs in the aluminium matrix and interface bonding, such as pre-treatment of CNTs with a surface coating before adding the CNTs to the aluminium matrix (3) the characterization of the Al/CNTs composites, including microstructures,  mechanical properties, and thermal conductivity.



The successful development of the Al-CNTs composites is expected to provide advanced lightweight materials with superior strength and stiffness for various applications, such as aerospace and automotive industries.

"With recent advances in computing, networking, sensing and control technologies, networked embedded systems are becoming ubiquitous. Networked embedded systems play a crucial role in many applications such as transportation, manufacturing, health care, environmental monitoring, and disaster relief.



Unlike existing computing systems, networked embedded systems are decentralized, embedded in the physical world, and in continuous interaction with people and physical environments. The unique characteristics and requirements of networked embedded systems pose many new challenges for systems and networking research. In this proposal, we propose and investigate an integrated framework of scheduling, optimization, and control to facilitate the design and analysis of high-performance, energy efficient, real-time networked embedded systems. We draw upon technical advances in three major areas: 1) real-time scheduling algorithms and bounds under uncertainties, 2) feedback based performance management, and 3) collaborative constraint-based resource allocations. We propose new models and analysis techniques, adaptive strategies and algorithms, and software architectures for networked embedded systems. We plan to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed integrated framework in real world applications including embedded sensor and actuator networks.

"Computers, data centers, and servers have become the backbone of our society. The heart of a computer is the Central Processing Unit (CPU). Power conversion in computer, data center, and server typically occurs in two stages: 120VAC to a 12VDC AC-DC conversion followed by a Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) which regulate the CPU voltages at 1.2V (varying from 0.8V to 1.6V) from 12VDC. The next generation CPU will require the VRM to achieve high efficiency, fast dynamic response and lower cost.



The proposed research program will develop new technologies to increase the VRM power conversion efficiency. Research work will be done in three distinct, but closely related areas, new MOSFET driver technologies to reduce switching loss, new control strategies to improve dynamic response, and new non-isolated DC-DC converter topologies for improved efficiency. 



It is expected that with the new technology, the VRM conversion efficiency can be improved by 5% (from 85% to 90%), which can reduce the energy consumption by $3 billion worldwide based on an analysis by Dell Computers. This will reduce green house gas emission. In addition, with the new technology, the cost of VRM can be reduced by around 20% and the VRM board area can be reduced by around 30%. The new computers will become more energy efficient, reliable and economic.



It is expected that during the research program, six graduate students will be trained, 20 journal papers will be published, and several patents will be generated. The technologies developed in this research program will be transferred to industry improving Canadian industry's competitiveness and creating more jobs in Canada.","Electrical and electronic machinery and equipment (including computer hardware)","Manufacturing processes and products","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Liu, YanFei","RGPIN ","Industrial and power electronics","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",1-5
"Over the past decade, the application of molecular biology tools in Environmental Engineering has become widespread.  The new molecular approach, such as the polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technique, has opened up opportunities to analyze complex microbial communities on the basis of DNA sequence diversity.  This approach identifies microorganisms regardless of their culturability eliminating both the time required for growth and the biases associated with cultured growth.



In the current research, PCR-DGGE fingerprinting is proposed to identify bacterial community structures isolated from environmental samples, to evaluate microorganism diversity in response to environmental stress and to assess microbiological water quality.  In particular, the system will be applied in several fields of Environmental Engineering including wastewater biological treatment processes, natural aquatic systems, bioremediation and waste composting. 



The Environmental Engineering group at the University of Alberta stands to benefit from acquiring a PCR-DGGE system, which is currently unavailable to them, as it will allow the group to conduct molecular biological research projects involving microbial identification and community analysis of environmental samples. The requested equipment will provide both research and educational opportunities that integrate molecular biology and environmental engineering for tackling some of our toughest environmental problems.

"Advances in computer, communication, and networking technologies have enabled many network applications. An important category of applications requires timely delivery of real-time data. Traditional IP-based networks provide a best-effort service; their delay performance is good when the traffic is light. However, they do not scale well when the level of traffic increases; for example, when congestion occurs along the data path. Thus to support real-time applications, network quality-of-service (QoS) strategies are needed. Example strategies are channel scheduling, admission control, and pricing. Over the past two decades, two approaches to network QoS provision have been developed: flow-based and deadline-based. In this research, we will design and evaluate a unified approach to network QoS provision, based on solutions and findings obtained from both flow-based and deadline-based approaches. Our goal is to develop cost-effective end-to-end QoS solutions that support a wide variety of real-time applications. A key player in QoS provision is the network (or Internet) service providers (ISPs). In this research, we also target the design of ISP QoS strategies. Differ from the end-to-end QoS study, the emphasis here is the resource management within an ISP network. Results from these studies would aid in the design of QoS infrastructure for next generation computer networks. A well-designed and well-dimensioned network should accommodate most of its traffic. Mathematical models may be used in network design and dimensioning. Good mathematical models have been developed for similar networks and may be applied to IP-based networks, provided that certain traffic characteristics are presented. Such traffic characteristics may be obtained by the proper design of those entities that affect traffic characteristics. Example entities include higher-layer protocols, network resource management, and traffic multiplexing. We study the effect of such entities on traffic; our long-term objective is to design such entities and to come up with sound performance models for end-to-end data communication. Results from this research will provide invaluable insight into the performance modeling of next generation computer communication networks.

"As the most commonly used masonry structural components, masonry load bearing walls are frequently subjected to the action of concentric or eccentric gravity loads in combination with lateral loads due to wind or earthquake. The apparent strength of these members is compromised by a secondary moment caused by the gravity load acting through a deflected shape. Due to the low tensile strength of masonry, this situation is further complicated by tension cracking which leads to variations of effective sectional properties over the member height. The reduction in the load carrying capacity of walls due to secondary effects can be significant and the design of these members has to include the secondary moment effects in a rational way. 

    )	While the current Canadian masonry design standard (CSA S304.1-04) recommends a moment magnifier method to account for the secondary moment effect, disparities are often found between the standard suggested equations and experimental results. The complexities associated with both material and geometric nonlinear responses result in a relatively limited application of the existing equations.

    )	The overall goal of this proposal is to study how various parameters such as physical and mechanical characteristics of masonry and varying loading and boundary conditions affect the strength and behaviour of masonry load bearing walls. This study will be carried out in two phases. In Phase 1, realistically sized wall specimens with various material and geometrical properties will be tested as structural elements under different loading and boundary combinations. In Phase 2, masonry structural wall systems simulating real masonry wall construction will be tested to study the interaction between the masonry wall and its surrounding structural elements. A previously developed analytical model will be refined, verified with the test results and then used in an extensive parametric study. It is anticipated that this in-depth study will further the understanding of the behaviour of masonry load bearing walls and will result in important beneficial refinements to present design procedures in Canada.

"The proposed research program will provide new information on the atmospheric state vectors (particularly composition and temperature) in the upper stratosphere, throughout the mesosphere and into the lower thermosphere using data from satellites. We intend to take advantage of the data-set from the OSIRIS instrument - a spectrograph and imager - on the Odin satellite. The data inversion methods will use both the tomographic algorithms developed by the University of Saskatchewan group as well new approaches for weak emissions embedded in a strong solar background. These analysis procedures allow both the vertical and horizontal structure of the measured quantities to be retrieved.

Previous results show that ozone exhibits significant vertical and horizontal structure. We intend to validate the derived mesospheric ozone concentrations with those derived from the optical spectrograph; this latter is now possible as reliable ultra-violet radiance models have been developed by various members of the University of Saskatchewan aeronomy team. The spectrograph observations of the OH resonance emission at 308 nm have been, and will be, used to provide new information on the OH (X, v=0) populations and water vapour concentrations. We will compare our derived water vapour concentrations with those derived from the OSIRIS observations of the direct Ly-? photolysis of water vapour. We also intend to study the diurnal variation of water vapour and the OH 'hot' line observations made by OSIRIS. We intend to relate the observed mesospheric ozone structures with possible loss mechanisms; we believe that these are related to hydrogen, and so water vapour, chemistry, and enhance the spectrograph water vapour profiles. It is expected that the findings from this research will provide new information on the transport of hydrogen through the mesosphere and into the thermosphere. We will use the OSIRIS observations to derive the mesospheric temperature profile in the presence of PMC's.

A major objective of the entire research program is to enhance the training of highly qualified personnel.

"Mannheimia haemolytica A1 (Mh) is an important bacterial pathogen that causes bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis. This respitatory disease results in millions of dollars in economic loss annually to the feedlot cattle industry. Hence, there are continuing interest in understanding the pathogenesis of the bacterium as well as to develop effecive measures to protect animals from the infection. My laboratory has been successful on the characterization of genes that code for many of the virulence factors of the bacterium for more than 20 years. Some of these virulence factors have been produced as recombinant antigens as vaccine components or expressed from transgenic plants in the development of an oral delivery system. On the other hand, the mechanisms that regulate expressin of these virulence genes are not understood. Very little is known about when these virulence genes are expressed during different stages of the infection process. In addition, nothing is known about the enviromental signals that regulate expression of these virulence genes. The objective of this proposal are: i) investigate expression profiles of these genes during an infection in vivo in the animals; and ii) to investigate the mechanisms that regulate expression of the virulence genes. Time course infection experiments will be carried out in which several animals will be infected with Mh and monitored for pneumonic signs. At daily intervals, either nasal samples will be collected or a calf will be sacrificed. Lung washings and lung tissue samples will be collected for extraction of total RNA. The RNA will be used in real-time RT-PCR using Mh specific primers to examine expression of specific genes. It is anticipated that some genes will be expressed early during the infection and some later, depending on the activity of their encoded products in pathogenesis. A second objective is examine the contribution of two-component regulatory systems in regulation of the virulence genes. We have identified several pairs of there systems from the Mh genome sequence. Mutants will be constructed in each of the two cognate proteins to examine the effects on protein expression and the regulatory pathway in response to the two-component system.

"The research proposed aims to develop new waste management and water reuse processes for the livestock industry to help control pollution and enhance nutrients utilization ans water reuse. Such an approach will help minimize environmental deterioration and prevent ecosystem health degradation at the same time as it seeks to recovery nutrients from dairy wastes and reuse of the treated wastewater effluent. An innovative new wastewater treatment process train will be developed, which will seek to conserve nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, rather than remove them. Nutrients conservation in manure management systems, and their subsequent extraction from the effluent for reuse as fertilizer will have a major impact on the schemes of animal manure management. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in process wastewaters will be recovered as struvite, a valuable, slow-release, fertilizer via a new crystallization process developed at UBC. A novel biological process using lab-scale sequencing batch reactors will be developed and tested during the first phase of experimental work. In addition to the biological process, an innovative microwave enhanced, advanced oxidation process will be examined for its suitability for treating and releasing nutrients from raw dairy manure. Upon the completion of the laboratory testing, a compact wastewater treatment facility will be designed, constructed at the UBC Dairy Education and Research Centre. The technology developed in this work will be fully tested and evaluated in pilot-scale studies at the dairy research centre. It is anticipated that the technologies developed during this research will have substantial positive impacts on both the economic and environmental sustainability of the livestock industry. The knowledge and technology developed during the course of these studies should also have immediate applications and benefits to Canadian engineering companies. It also has the potential to develop new secondary industry for animal waste management in B.C., as well as elsewhere in Canada.

"Tillage moves a tremendous amount of soil within cultivated landscapes. For intensive, and still common tillage operations, one pass of tillage can move 50 to 100 kg of soil per meter width of tillage in the direction of tillage and can move some of that soil in excess of 4 meters. Soil movement is characterized by the movement of soil during tillage and by the displacement, or translocation of soil that is caused by tillage. In the study of tillage tool design, arrangement and operation, it is necessary to measure soil movement during tillage. It is necessary to measure soil translocation by tillage in the study of dispersion of soil constituents, amendments and contaminants. It is also necessary to measure translocation in the study of tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the loss and accumulation of soil within a landscape resulting from the net movement of soil that is caused by the variability of translocation. The amount of translocation and its variability are affected by the design and operation of tillage implements and by the topographic and soil properties of landscapes. Although tillage translocation is now recognized as a major landscape process with significant agricultural and environmental implications, by comparison to other landscape processes, very little is understood about the movement of soil by tillage. There is a great need for fundamental understanding of soil movement by tillage to better manage and model the movement of soil during tillage and the translocation of soil by tillage, particularly on sloping land. The objectives of the proposed research are: 1) to examine the movement of soil by tillage on level and sloping land, and, based on these findings, 2) to develop and validate mechanistic models of the movement of soil by tillage on level and sloping land. The ultimate goal of this research will be to develop tillage equipment, practices and systems that better control the movement of soil and minimize the adverse effects of tillage translocation and tillage erosion. The study of tillage translocation and tillage erosion is a new and rapidly expanding area of research that integrates soil and environmental sciences with agricultural engineering. The proposed research will make significant contributions to this emerging area of science and engineering.

"Statistical methods of data analysis rely on probabilistic models which describe the assumed nature of the mechanism which generated the data.  The assumptions made are sometimes critical to the validity of the analysis.  Statisticians have therefore developed statistical methods to check the assumptions being made; the resulting tools are described as model assessment, model validation or goodness-of-fit techniques.   Probabilistic models in current use have become very complex and there is a great need for more such model assessment methods.  At the same time the methods already developed are often quite ad hoc -- not based on any overarching principles.  Finally the statistical behaviour of model assessment methods can be very hard to compute in modern complex models.



My proposal is to work in three areas.  First, I want to continue to develop new model assessment techniques.  Second, I want to use methods from the so-called Bayesian approach to statistical inference to try to derive techniques in a principled way.  Finally I intend to continue my work on developing approximate computation methods in order to evaluate how well model assessment techniques perform.

"High frequency ultrasound is a relatively new field in medical imaging. Compared with conventional ultrasound systems operating at 3.5 MHz, a high frequency system operating at 50 MHz could resolve structures approximately 15 times smaller. A valuable application of high frequency imaging is catheter based intravascular imaging for assisting in the selection and evaluation of the therapeutic procedures used to re-establish the flow in occluded arteries. High frequency ultrasound systems currently use single-element transducers that are either unfocused or geometrically shaped to focus the ultrasound. Although this approach simplifies the development of the transducer and system electronics, the fixed geometry of the transducer introduces a compromise between image resolution and the depth over which the image can be focused. Conventional scanners operating in the 2-10 MHz frequency range avoid this problem by using a linear transducer array with between 100-200 individual transducer elements. By appropriately delaying the signals applied to and received from the array elements using an ultrasound beamformer, the ultrasound beam can be scanned and focused throughout the image plane. Unfortunately, fabricating transducer arrays suitable for high frequency imaging is challenging due to the small size of the array elements. It is even more challenging to fabricate a high frequency array suitable for a catheter based imaging system since the outer diameter of the catheter ultimately limits how many cables can be used to connect to the array elements.  The goal of the research described in this proposal is to design and fabricate a miniature (1-2 mm diameter) high frequency (50 MHz) electronically 'scannable' annular array for intravascular imaging. The array will be developed based on a hybrid transducer structure incorporating a piezoelectric substrate and a silicon substrate in the same device. The resulting array will provide electronic focusing and steering of the ultrasound beam while using only 1/10th of the cables required by a more conventional design.

"The goal of this research program is the design and development of new molecular machines and molecular switches for the advancement of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The molecules we investigate contain at least two parts which are interlocked - in the same fashion, as say, two links in a metal chain.  In particular, we study what are known as rotaxanes. When a linear axle molecule is threaded through the central cavity of a cyclic wheel molecule a new interpenetrated molecule known as a pseudo-rotaxane is formed. When large stoppers are attached to the axle to prevent unthreading of the wheel a permanently interlocked molecule know as a rotaxane is formed. This work trains researchers in synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry as well as methods for physical characterization in solution and the solid state. The eventual goal of the program is to create materials comprised of arrays of nanoscale (rotaxane) components. We envision that control of individual rotaxane units on the molecular scale can be used as a way to manipulate bulk material properties. This could have future impact on the way we design and manufacture high technology components for the electronics and computer industries.

"Today there is only limited information available about the therapeutic efficacy, interaction, toxicity of nano-sized delivery systems with lung epithelia cells and alveolar macrophages. A mechanistic assessment of the different effects an active principle (e.g. drug), excipients (e.g. matrix material) or a  nanoparticle and a combination of all of them as a drug delivery system needs to be performed.

The aim of this grant is to study the mechanistic details of the effects of nano-sized pharmaceutical materials and their excipients with lung epithelia cells and macrophages. This will include the following objectives: 1) Synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles with different sizes and surface properties. 2) Evaluation of the intrinsic toxicity of nanoparticles and excipients using lung epithelia cells and macrophages. 3) Evaluation of secondary toxicity effects triggered by macrophages on other lung epithelium cells. 4) Systematic evaluation of translocation/permeability of nanoparticles and coated nanoparticles with lung mono layers. 

The expected outcome of this research is the development of in vitro assessment techniques to predict the efficiency, toxicity and dosing margins of nano-sized materials in the alveolar region. The mechanistic investigation of these interactions will be used I the future to predict the in vivo behavior of pulmonary drug delivery systems. This will be the basis to develop optimization strategies of inhalable nanoparticles.

"Two areas are covered in the proposed research.  The  first area is the design and analysis of computer experiments.  Computer models are widely used in almost every area of science and engineering to model physical processes.  The computer model or code requires a set of inputs, some of which are known and others are unknown.   When physical experimentation is possible statistical models can be used to combine data from the computer code and data from the physical process.  The statistical model can be used to estimate the unknown inputs, the calibration problem, and help assess how well the computer model represents the true physical process and the uncertainty associated with predictions from the model, the validation problem.   Important application of calibration arise in cosmology and the study of dark matter structure formations where recent observational studies have made it very important to combine physical data and results from computer models to extract accurate estimates of cosmological parameters.  Assessing how well the computer model represents reality and making predictions from the model with associated uncertainty bounds is very important in global climate modeling. Secondly, the design of experiments for physical processes is considered with a focus on efficient strategies for the design of factorial experiments used for industrial product improvement.

"The objective of this grant proposal is to define roles for lipids in the regulation of cellular metabolism. This research will enhance our understanding of basic mechanisms of lipid-mediated intracellular signalling and will identify new metabolic regulatory mechanisms important to all organisms. Presently, very little is known about the functions of lipids in these processes. The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be an excellent model system for investigating the roles of lipids in cells because of the ease of genetic manipulation in this organism. Many of the groundbreaking discoveries made in yeast have been highly applicable to higher organisms including humans. We will use sophisticated high-throughput yeast genetics to define cellular pathways that regulate phospholipid metabolism on a genome-wide scale. These studies will identify important new factors involved in the global control of lipid synthesis. We will also combine proteomic analysis with the power of yeast genetics to define new roles for lipids of the endoplasmic reticulum in signalling and metabolic regulation, and also identify their protein effectors. These studies will identify new lipid signalling complexes within the cell and are important because they will uncover fundamental mechanisms of lipid-based signal transduction.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Cellular and Physiological Sciences","Loewen, Christopher","RGPIN ","Cell biology","Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",3-5
"The formation of an ice cover in a river is quite different from that on a lake because of the river's current.  The turbulence in the flow causes the formation of a special kind of ice particle, known as frazil ice, which is very 'sticky' when first formed.  These frazil particles tend to stick to each other, to metal screens and racks at water intakes, to rocks on the river bed, and even to vegetation in the river.  This can be a serious problem for hydro-power utilities as well as for municipal and industrial water supplies, since large accumulations of frazil can completely block the intakes, forcing plants to shutdown.  These disruptions to power systems and water supplies have significant socioeconomic costs.

At the present time we can detect frazil using a relatively new device known as the Shallow Water Ice Profiling Sonar (SWIPS) which works much like a 'fish finder'.  However, it only indicates the presence of frazil ice and does not provide any measure of the amount of frazil, which is important both for operational purposes (so water intakes can be operated to avoid frazil ice blockage) and for planning purposes (as an input to computer models for predicting ice problems and solutions).  The purpose of the proposed study is to develop a method for making accurate measurements of frazil ice properties, including concentration, using the SWIPS instrument.  This will be achieved by conducting a series of controlled laboratory experiments to determine the quantitative relationship between the SWIPS data and frazil ice properties.  In addition, field data will be collected with the SWIPS in the Athabasca River to demonstrate the application of this new technology in the field.  When coupled with numerical ice process modeling, this will provide validation of the new technology.

The findings of this study will reside in the public domain, through publication of the research results in scholarly journals.  Thus the technology will be open to all, and widely available. Given the overwhelming significance of frazil ice deposition and transport to river ice hydraulics and to winter stream ecology the benefits to Canada cannot be overstated.

"This equipment request is for an Ussing chamber station. This apparatus will be used by a new faculty member at the University of Saskatchewan for the measurement of current produced by salt movement across cells. The applicant will make extensive use of the equipment in his research program by measuring the movement of chloride, a component of salt, in cells lining the airway (or windpipe). In the long term, his research program will develop a more in-depth knowledge of proteins called channels that allow the movement of chloride out of cells and onto the airway surface. The chloride pulls water with it, thus properly hydrating the airway and protecting it against infection. This research will lead to a better understanding of respiratory diseases that impact Canadians, such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and will lead to the development of innovative treatments. This new equipment is crucial for effective execution of the research program of the applicant. The only equipment available is 25 years old, slow, unreliable, and at times inaccurate. The new equipment will produce results faster because of its larger capacity, be reliable because of its age and quality, give more accurate results because of its new electronics, and run more samples simultaneously.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Veterinary Biomedical Sciences","Loewen, Matthew","EQPEQ ",Electrophysiology,"Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",1-1

"The primary goal of the proposed research is to characterize proteins that protect organisms against oxidative stress.  For over 20 years, research in the Loewen laboratory has been focused on monofunctional catalases and bifunctional catalase-peroxidases which have as their main physiological role the degradation of potentially toxic hydrogen peroxide to harmless water and oxygen.  Work has progressed from bacterial genetic analysis, through molecular genetic characterization to protein structure determination and has provided a greatly improved understanding of how the enzymes respond to physiological challenge in different organisms.  The recent adoption of protein X-ray crystallography procedures in the laboratory has made it possible to address questions about the catalytic mechanisms operating in the enzymes; the proposed research will continue in this direction.  The goal of the proposed research is to characterize factors that protect organisms against hydrogen peroxide and the specific objectives are to characterize and rationalize structural features that affect the catalytic mechanisms in catalase-peroxidases and monofunctional catalases. The bifunctional catalase-peroxidases have gained considerable notoriety from their role as the activator of the widely used anti-tubercular pro-drug isoniazid.  In particular, strains of M. tuberculosis lacking the enzyme are resistant to the drug, giving rise to the most common cause of the spread of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis and producing a serious health risk. One branch of the proposed research will focus on defining the catalytic mechanism involved in isoniazid activation.  The research will enhance our knowledge of enzyme catalysis by providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of hydrogen peroxide degradation and of isoniazid activation as a drug against tuberculosis.

"Recent developments in analysis and electronic technology have opened many new theoretical and computational possibilities under the broad heading of optimization. This research deals primarily with Dynamic Optimization, in which complicated processes governed by differential equations or difference equations are to be influenced in the best possible way through a suitable choice of a function--not just a number or a finite collection of numbers. Professor Loewen will be building new theoretical foundations, algorithms, and software to address these issues. His focus will be on the advantages that recent developments in convex analysis make available to modern theory and practice. Industrial relevance is of prime importance in this project.

"This research aims to advance our knowledge of fundamental processes controlling the health and development of all complex organisms.  There is potential for the outcomes from this research to benefit human life through a better understanding of basic biology that can be exploited by agricultural and medical sciences.



All living things are cells, or are composed of cells.  Mitochondria are life-giving semi-independent membranous structures within the cells of animals and plants.  Mitochondria are primarily known for their role in helping convert the energy stored within the chemical bonds of a variety of nutrients (e.g. sugars and fat), into a form that can be easily used to fuel the needs of all cells in the organism. For example, animal muscle cells contain many mitochondria because muscle cells use a lot of energy during contraction. Despite the importance of mitochondrial function to animals and plants little is known about how mitochondrial shape, size, number and distribution within the cell (collectively termed mitochondrial dynamics) are controlled - processes that are known to affect the energy converting capabilities of mitochondria.  The first aim of the research is to identify the genes controlling mitochondrial dynamics. One area of plant cell function affected by mitochondrial dynamics is programmed cell death (PCD).  PCD is vital for the maintenance and development of healthy tissues. Rather than being a contradiction in terms this statement highlights the importance of limited and localised cell killing to the health and normal development of complex organisms.  Examples of developmentally regulated PCD in plants include leaf senescence and wood formation.  In addition, PCD is activated in response to pathogen attack and environmental stresses. A second aim of the proposed research is to determine the role of mitochondria in the induction and regulation of PCD in higher plants.  The research uses molecular biology tools coupled to state-of-the-art biological imaging techniques to test the hypothesis that mitochondria dynamics underpin cell and organism health and development.

"The challenge of particle physics is to discover what the universe is made of and how it works. Our quest to understand nature has produced a remarkably detailed understanding of the structure of matter, space and time, a product of decades of advances in theory and experiment. We have come now to a tremendously exciting time when experiments in the next few years promise to shed light on two fundamental mysteries: the existence of mass in our universe, and the surprising weakness of gravity compared to the other forces of nature.



I study new theories of particle physics beyond our current Standard Model that address these twin mysteries. Whatever is responsible for the existence of mass and the phenomenal weakness of gravity, it must manifest experimentally at or below the tera-electron-volt scale. This energy scale will be thoroughly explored by the Large Hadron Collider now beginning operations at CERN in Geneva -- in order to make good use of the data that will come out of this collider, we need detailed theory calculations of both the expectations within the Standard Model and the potential signals of a variety of new models. The calculation of these expectations is the focus of my research.



In particular, I'm studying the collider predictions of a number of new models, including models with extra Higgs bosons that shed light on the origin of the mass of normal matter and also possibly of neutrinos. This involves formulating the new models, working out the particle content and interactions, running simulations of particle production events, and developing strategies that experimenters can use to distinguish genuine new physics signals from the familiar Standard Model backgrounds.  I will continue to train undergraduate and graduate students in these areas of research in the next 5 years.

"Caffeine is widely consumed almost everywhere, typically in flavored drinks.  The pharmacological affects of the caffeine affect our reactions to those drinks, i.e., whether we like and want them.  In a rat model of caffeine consumption we will examine the extent to which rats want/don't want and like/don't like novel flavors that (1) accompany the first use of caffeine; and (2) that accompany the resumption of caffeine intake when the rat is in caffeine withdrawal or (3) accompany the intake of a non-cafffeinated drink when the rat is in caffeine withdrawal.  Examples of the questions we will ask include:  (1)  Will a rat come to want and like a flavor of a caffeinated beverage that he experienced while caffeine deprived and which alleviated withdrawal?  Does the answer depend on whether the rat was caffeine deprived when we asked the question?       



Wanting will be inferred from the preference for the target flavor when it is pitted against a neutral flavor in a 2-bottle preference test.  Liking will be inferred from the rats' orofacial  responses to a flavor that is dripped into its mouth for a minute or two.  Liked and disliked flavors are known to evoke markedly different patterns of behavior.  Disliked (unpalatable) flavors elicit gapes, rubbing the chin against the floor and passing the forelimbs over the face and then flailing them, thereby throwing off droplets of the tastant.  Liked (palatable) flavors are known to evoke rapid mouth movements and tongue protrusions.  Changes in wanting are not always accompanied by changes in liking, e.g., preference for a flavor increases if it has been paired with sweet saccharin, but orofacial responses to that flavor do not change.  Our goal is to understand the ways in which caffeine contributes to changes in liking and wanting flavors.

"Particle physics seeks to understand nature - and all its laws - at the most fundamental level, down to its  elementary constituents and their interactions.  Tremendous strides have been made in the last several decades using accelerators and astrophysical observations - that have strengthened our conviction that the basic model,  also known as the Standard Model (SM), is essentially a valid description of the subatomic world.  Its success  is based fundamentally on the concept of asymptotic freedom, which stipulates that the quarks, the most  elemental particles, behave as free particles when their separation is small (high energy collisions) so that  accurate analytical calculations of their interactions can be made.  However, when the quarks are bound  together to form matter as we know it, their interactions are so strong that they cannot be separated and cannot  exist as individual quarks.  This is an experimental fact that imposes an additional aspect to the SM, that of  confinement of quarks.  It remains one of the outstanding problems in physics. In the confinement regime, where analytical calculations are not feasible, models have to be constructed with  the freedom to adjust inputs - as required by the experimental data - in order to learn about fundamental aspects of the problem at hand.  For this to lead to a solid understanding of the true nature of confinement, high quality and reliable experimental data are absolutely necessary.  The goal of this proposal is to create and identify exotic forms of matter that, by their very nature, exhibit unique signatures among all other particles that will  allow theoretical models of confinement to be tested in the most constraining possible way.   This is a difficult  task requiring experimental conditions that are now becoming possible, both in accelerator and photo-sensor  technologies.  The latter is driven by the Canadian group and has important applications in medical physics and imaging.

"The first aim of this application is to obtain funds for the purchase of equipment to complete an electrophysiological recording system.  The new system will permit neurophysiological recordings to be made from auditory cortex in the awake cat.  Such a system will allow us to record neural activity in individual areas of auditory cortex while the animals are performing acoustic discriminations.  Activation of neurons in higher-order acoustic cortical fields is generally difficult during anesthesia.  In addition, no behavioral experiments can be conducted under these conditions.  Therefore, completion of a system to permit electrophysiological recordings from an awake animal will be a significant advance for our research program.  Specifically, we seek to acquire a vibration free table and Faraday cage, a stereotaxic apparatus, and a microscope with camera.  We already possess the other necessary hardware and software.  The second aim of this application is to obtain funds for the purchase of a state-of-the-art thermodynamic imaging camera to permit the real-time imaging of the cerebral cortex during reversible cooling deactivation.  As our laboratory has lead the development of reversible cooling deactivation technology, we have identified that the use of new infrared, thermodynamic imaging technology, only recently made available in Canada, will greatly advance our ability to determine the size of a deactivation locus at time of cryoloop implant.  This new technology will permit us to determine the size of the deactivated area, in vivo, prior to initiating electrophysiological or behavioral experiments.  This camera will greatly advance our work and data collection.  In total, this equipment will immensely enhance the quality of research that is presently carried out on our NSERC grant.  In addition, it will enrich the training of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows presently working in our laboratory as well as future trainees.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge","Physiology and Pharmacology","Lomber, Stephen","EQPEQ ","Sensory systems -- auditory",Psychology,Psychologie,1-1

"The ultimate goal of particle physics is to find the theory which unifies all the forces and particles in Nature. A first step has been taken with the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces into a single ""electroweak"" force. The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, which includes the electroweak and the strong forces, successfully explains all known experimental data. Nevertheless, it is clearly not the final theory -- only two of the four forces are unified, and the SM leaves many questions unanswered. Thus, there must be ""physics beyond the SM,"" that is, phenomena which cannot be explained by the SM alone. The search for this ""new physics"" (NP) is the most important problem facing particle physicists today.



One area of the SM which has not been well tested --- and is therefore a good place to look for new physics -- is the physics of B mesons in general, and CP violation in particular. The SM predicts large CP-violating effects in B decays, and two ""B-factories"" were built to test this. They started taking data several years ago, and the first evidence for CP violation in the B system was observed in the summer of 2001! Many of my projects are in this area of research. By comparing the data for a variety of B decays with the predictions of the SM, we hope to find evidence for physics beyond the SM. Indeed, at present there are a number of discrepancies with the SM in B decays. Although none are statistically significant, they are intriguing as all point to NP in b -> s transitions. We may be seeing the first signal of physics beyond the SM.



This NP may also affect other particles of the SM. For example, there may be new effects in the decays of tau leptons and top quarks.  In addition, new, exotic particles are often predicted.  I have several other research projects, and they all have one common goal: to elucidate the predictions of the SM for various processes, and to examine the possibilities for the detection of new physics.

"Oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen are among the most abundant elements making up Earth's atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. The atoms of each of these elements occur naturally in two or three forms - known as stable isotopes. Their relative abundances (e.g., oxygen-18 vs. oxygen-16, carbon-13 vs. carbon-12, nitrogen-15 vs. nitrogen-14, and hydrogen-2 vs. hydrogen-1) in rocks, minerals, water, plants and animals are determined by the source of the element (freshwater, seawater, atmosphere, biosphere, shallow or deep Earth) and the conditions (temperature, aridity, photosynthetic pathway, diet) under which each substance developed. The objective of my research is to improve our ability to measure stable isotopic compositions in Earth materials, and to interpret these ratios in terms of the processes that created them. To what purpose, you ask? On one hand, we are using the stable isotopic compositions of rocks and minerals to identify the sources and types of fluids that swept through Earth's crust over a vast area of very old (760 - 510 million years) rocks now comprising parts of New Brunswick, mainland Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island, Newfoundland and Massachusetts. Our goal is to learn the cause and timing of this large-scale interaction between rock and hot water, and its consequences for creation or destruction of economic mineral deposits. On the other hand, we are using the signatures of environmental conditions captured in the isotopic compositions of freshwater, plant tissues (organic matter), shelly fauna, and teeth and bones (e.g., mammoths and mastodons) to track changing climatic/ecosystem conditions over time. Ancient soils and sediments contain many such proxy materials, which can be dated. An immediate goal is to determine the pathways of glacial meltwater in the Great Lakes region at the end of the last Ice Age. A longer range objective is to increase our understanding of North American climatic conditions over the last ~15,000 years. Better understanding of the rate of past climate change in this now heavily populated mid-continental region should lead to better predictive capabilities for its future behaviour.

"My proposal concerns the biophysical mechanisms by which sensory signal mixtures are first turned into electrical activity in neurons, and subsequently deciphered by higher brain centers. It focusses specifically on how neural plasticity and feedback are implicated. The larger goal is to uncover fundamental principles of

neural coding. This is not only exciting from a basic science point of view; it can also lead to numerous applications in e.g. bionics, prosthesis design, psychophysics and medicine. The research is theoretical and computational in nature. It relies on close interaction with experimental collaborators working with weakly

electric fish (L. Maler, J. Lewis) and frogs (G. Rose). They provide much of the data I use for modeling, and my predictions help refine or redefine their experiments. The proposal involves formulation/analysis of nonlinear differential equations for neural activity; they include noise, and memory due

to conduction delays and synaptic processes. Coding for signal mixtures is a task faced by all nervous systems. There exist non-biological ""blind source separation"" (BSS) algorithms, but the neural basis for the great ability of humans to do BSS is still elusive. I will study this general problem by focusing on how lower vertebrates

solve it. Specifically, I will study how feedback from higher brain centers back down to more peripheral centers involved in early processing of incoming signals can implement source separation. I will also study neurons in the auditory system of frogs that respond only after a given number of calls are received. This neural counting will be modeled using biophysically plausible plasticity mechanisms. It will give insight into the general question of whether there exist brain structures that support a primitive ""number sense"". Finally this proposal will look at mechanisms that underlie the perception of musical consonnance. We will model existing data on how the auditory system of humans and non-human primates becomes activated with simple chords. This will yield biophysical insight into the preference for certain combinations of tones.

"The biomedical sciences are at the stage where quantitative methods from physical sciences and engineering can make a big impact on fundamental and technological advances. At the same time, computational modeling techniques at each of these levels have generated deep insights into the biophysical principles of life as well as into tools for probing biological organization. We propose an integrated, interdisciplinary training program for undergraduates, graduates and postdoctoral fellows that brings together physical scientists and engineers with medical researchers to create an interdisciplinary effort in quantitative life science and technology that is unique in Canada. This program falls under the ""health and related life sciences and technologies"" area of priority for NSERC. It is grounded in the areas of biological physics, photonics, photochemistry, systems biology and neuroscience in which the University of Ottawa has invested heavily. Canada's R&D sector needs scientists and engineers with a deep understanding of current challenges and opportunities in the biomedical sciences. Therefore we will train HQP with the broad interdisciplinary skills required for addressing these challenges. Specifically, the emphasis will be placed on tools to probe, manipulate, and simulate living systems at the molecular, cellular and systems level. The trainees will benefit from the rich research environment provided by the U. Ottawa, the National Research Council, the Ottawa Health Research Institutes and Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories. Their training will be enhanced by dedicated cross-disciplinary courses, summer schools and short-term research visits to institutes of our international network of collaborators. Our trainees will receive career development, professional practice, communication, risk management, and second language training. Our trainees will be able to address problems at the interfaces  between 1) the physical and biomedical sciences,2) the experimental and computational sciences, and 3) different scales of biological organization (molecular, cellular and tissue). Our unique blend of expertises will position our graduates to tap into emerging possibilities in academia and in industry.

"We will develop a UV-Vis absorption detector that is capable of quantifying dilute chemical substances at four

wavelengths between 480 -255 nm and in volumes of less than 10 nanoliters.



The detector will be an alternative to fluorescence detection in micro-analytical separation methods, such as

micro-HPLC, microfluidic devices and capillary electrophoresis. This alternative is needed, because

compounds that do not exhibit native fluorescence presently require an error-prone and time-consuming

labeling step. Furthermore, the new detector is also expected to be a viable alternative to absorption detectors

commonly used in commercial chemical analysis labs. At present, many HPLC systems are coupled to

absorption detectors that achieve excellent sensitivity and detection limits for detection volumes in the

micro-liter range. By reducing the size of the separation system to micro-HPLC (nanoliter detection volumes),

a considerable amount of money could be saved, but this is not possible with present absorption detectors. We

expect that our detector will reduce the analysis time and the environmental footprint (solvent consumption) of

the chemical analysis, while retaining the sensitivity, accuracy and detection limits of analytical scale HPLC.



By the conclusion of Phase I we will have developed and built at least one prototype of a 4-wavelength

absorption detector. This detector will be tested along-side commercial absorption detectors in an analysis lab

in the pharmaceutical industry. One graduate student will be involved in the research and development of the

"Technological advances and environmental pressures are driving the interconnection of renewable energy sources to the distribution network. Distributed generation (DG), storage and controllable loads are collectively called distributed energy resources (DER). They can increase the power quality reliability (PQR) of electricity delivered to sensitive end users through power electronic interfaces. However, the addition of a large number of uncoordinated DERs can have detrimental effects on the network in terms of safety and efficiency. This problem can be mitigated by controlling clusters of DERs locally, as a microgrid, which can operate within its local distribution network or autonomously (islanded) when the utility grid is not available. Appropriate power management strategies must be developed so as to minimize operating costs and network losses while improving system stability and PQR. A number of research, development and demonstration (RD&D) microgrid projects are in progress, mostly in Japan, Europe and in the USA.

This project focuses on the issues of a solar neighborhood type system with high penetration of photovoltaics (PV). This technology is very attractive for residential and office buildings since it produces electricity as well as heated air to be used in ambient and water heating. In Canada, buildings account for about 30% of energy consumption and about 50% of electricity consumption (NRCan 2001). Due to the intermittent characteristics of PV, it needs to be supplemented with energy storage and other generation sources. The types, ratings and location of the DERs will be selected for a PV neighbourhood so as to minimize losses and operating cost. Techniques for coordinating the dynamic operation of DERs for increasing the PQR of the system will be investigated. The resulting technology can help eliminate the main reservations of utilities with regards to DERs.

"Rivers of South and Central America harbor more than 6000 species of freshwater fishes, the most diverse fish fauna on Earth. Remarkably, little is known about the origin of this astonishing diversity. Research funded by this proposal will study the evolution of Neotropical fishes using the family Cichlidae as a model. Our previous and ongoing work indicates that at least one group of American cichlids, the Geophaginae, diversified through a process known as adaptive radiation. This rapid diversification was probably associated with invasion of previously unoccupied ecological niches by lineages that would become the modern genera of Neotropical geophagines. Based on these results, we hypothesize that other groups of South and Central American cichlids may have also diversified by adaptive radiation. We will test this hypothesis by describing the evolutionary history of all Neotropical cichlids, reconstructing past events in their evolution and uncovering the forces that drove their diversification. Additionally, we will assess the importance of ecological pressures in Neotropical cichlid speciation by studying the modern ecology and genetics of the cichlid genus Geophagus from South America. Understanding how the diversity of South and Central American cichlids originated will shed light on the processes responsible for the origin of tropical freshwater fish in particular and biodiversity in general. This study should pave the way for future efforts to understand Neotropical freshwater fish evolution. The project also will generate extensive data on the ecology of Neotropical cichlids. This information should help conservation efforts and reveal potential vulnerabilities of tropical fishes and their environment to mounting threats in the form of unregulated fisheries, habitat modification for agriculture and hydroelectric development, and increasing demand on water resources.

"This research will investigate optimal approaches for the storage, retrieval and dynamic updating spatial data in a distributed networked environment. Spatial data are commonly used to describe, among other applications, geographic and geospatial information. This research will investigate how to optimally organize, distribute and replicate data as to support efficient searchability and as a consequence enhance data availability. There is a strong need for this research. Large stores of spatial data now exist, including satellite (e.g. RADARSAT) imagery, geographical mapping, aerial video inspection and weather observations, with new spatial data continually being gathered. Indeed, recent advances in sensor technology have led to an increase of several orders of magnitude in the amount of data collected. These large collections can only be hosted in a distributed manner across several hosts in a networked environment, either locally or remotely. This brings a host of research questions that need to be addressed, chiefly: - The design of spatial data structures and algorithms for geographic information systems that have as low a memory footprint as possible and still allow operations such as node additions and removals, node locking, range queries to be performed efficiently. - I/O aware spatial data structures that are sensitive to varying access costs across the memory hierarchy, including issues related to the cost of distributed, remote and secondary storage. - Caching strategies for distributed spatial data structures that to coordinate paging of indexing structures in order to reduce external (network or disk) accesses given changes in user requests. - Issues of consistency, replication and recoverability in distributed massive spatial data structures. - Data management and organization of geo-spatial data in ways that maintain efficiency of access, accuracy of data, as well as the ability to distribute the data. - Design of data structures for storing massive amounts of data that can be readily distributed over a network.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Advancement of knowledge","Computer Science, David R.

"The pervasiveness of computing devices has brought an exponential increase in the amount of electronic data. Such massive amounts of data necessitate efficient algorithms for processing, search and storage. In this case a novel algorithm can speed up solutions from years down to minutes of CPU time, or alternatively, prove that no better solution exists. We seek such advances in four well identified areas: 

+ Traffic measurement on the Internet. How can we monitor and learn dynamic connectivity properties and usage patterns on the Internet?

+ Index size for search engines. Search engines use an index data structure (not unlike a book's index) to speedup  searches. In the pattern matching problem, we are only required to report whether the word appears in the text, but not its location. We investigate how large the index needs to be in this case. This problem has applications in other contexts, such as DNA pattern matching and computer virus detection. 

+ Solving problems with incomplete information. Consider a program reacting to requests as they arrive. The program must deal with the uncertainty of not knowing when the next request will arrive and of what type it will be. This scenario has applications for motion planning in robotics, memory-read requests (paging), and scheduling of contract algorithms. In particular we will study the case in which the request sequence is known to have specific regularity (locality) properties and hence the computer solver can benefit from this knowledge.

+ Constraint programming. We consider problems that arise in practice yet are intractable (NP-complete). We propose algorithms that speed up the search for a solution such that the size of instances that can be solved is increased greatly. The constraints we have studied address a variety of problems such as scheduling airport gate usage, triage in health care, and computer resource allocation. In particular we will study the interdistance constraint, which models tasks such as landing slots in an airport in which airplanes must be spaced out in their approach to the runway.

"In our everyday life, lasers are everywhere ! DVD players, laser surgery, communications, etc. Although many of their properties are known and used in practical applications, many have still to be discovered, especially in extreme regimes of intense and ultrashort lasers.

Mathematical modelling and numerical simulation play an important role in the understanding, control and ultimately the conception of new laser technologies. The mathematical models are necessarily complex, since they involve interactions of matter at both the molecular and macroscopic scales. In order to implement these complex models, numerical simulation must be used.  This program is directed at the developement of new efficient mathematical and computational tools to study the interaction of lasers within gaseous environments.  This research will have a large impact in the laser community, as we will propose original, precise and performing simulation tools. This research will necessitate the involvement of several high qualified students.

"The depleted state of many marine resources and their supporting ocean ecosystems are of profound ecological, economical, and ethical concern for our society today. Throughout history, human activities have influenced marine species and coastal ecosystems, but the rate and scale of human impacts and resulting ecological changes have accelerated over time. One fundamental question to science, management, and conservation is: How much have human impacts changed species abundance and ecosystem structure in the past and how will this influence species survival and the functioning of ecosystems today and in the future? In order to judge the current state of depletion or recovery of any system it is essential to establish a historical baseline for comparison. Moreover, future predictions rely on understanding long-term trends and the underlying causes and consequences of change. Our current understanding of the cumulative effects of multiple human activities is weak, particularly over large temporal and spatial scales. The proposed research program addresses these issues by focusing on two major objectives: (1) to assess the ecosystem consequences of long-term changes in coastal ecosystems, and (2) to analyze the cumulative effects of multiple drivers of change. We will use a combination of historical time series analysis to assess long-term trends, multi-factorial field surveys to assess large-scale changes across gradients of human impacts, and laboratory experiments to analyze interactions between current drivers and future climate change. Ecosystem models will be applied to evaluate the structural and functional consequences of observed temporal and spatial changes. Overall, the proposed research program will enhance scientific knowledge and capacity in the developing fields of historical ecology, ecological forecasting, and the cumulative effects of multiple ecological controls. The scientific and applied importance makes this research program ideal for the training of highly qualified personnel for science, management, and conservation.

"Despite the fact that orthotic (brace)  has been used for 40 years for scoliosis treatment, the orthotic techniques are primarily empirical. The amount of time an orthosis is to be worn is generally based on intuition.  The most commonly recommended wear time is 23 hours per day; this number is not based on any objective data.  The outcome of orthotic treatment for Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is normally considered being associated with the patient's compliance.  The more often the patients wear their orthoses to the prescribed tightness as well as to the prescribed length of time each day, the better the treatment outcome is expected.  There is lack of a scientific basis for treatment protocol such as ""How tightly should patients wear their orthoses?  How long should they wear?  How good is their compliance at home and at school?  Are these factors really important, necessary and related to the clinical efficacy?""  Also, the in-brace correction seems to relate to the orthotic treatment outcome.  However, how much correction is needed to provide the optimal results is unknown.  Although radiographs can provide information on correction imposed by the brace, exposing growing children to additional radiation is undesirable.  Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand the science behind the phenomenon that braces appear effective. This proposal is to develop tools and methods that can be used to better understand the scientific basis behind the orthotic treatment for AIS.

"Despite over a half-century of incredible advances in our understanding of speciation mechanisms, there remain outstanding issues. In particular we lack comprehensive information on the geography and temporal sequence for the evolution of barriers to mating between evolutionary lineages [the hallmarks of speciation] across the entire range of single species. How has range fragmentation, precipitated by glaciations, ultimately impacted the evolution of reproductive isolating barriers? Does selection against hybridization after contact of long sundered lineages enhance differences in mating preferences, a process called reinforcement? Can differences in the mating system, particular breeding phenology (sequence of breeding activities), arise at fine scales under divergent ecological selection and restricted dispersal scenarios? We address these questions using genetic and experiment studies of a small North American frog, the spring peeper. For our first project, we identified major secondary contact zones between different pairs of lineages throughout the species' range, and will test for (1) key differences in the mate recognition system between lineages, (2) the genetic basis for male call and female preference differences for them, (3) evidence for genetic incompatibilities in hybrids, and (4) evidence for secondary reinforcement. Our second project will examine the ecological mechanisms that may cause such divergence. Specifically within an environmentally heterogeneous 2500 sq. km. area in Eastern Ontario, we will test whether selection pressures in habitats differing in vegetation structure and microclimate can produce significant differences in (1) spring emergence and calling times of males, and (2) the acoustic properties of male advertisement calls. Combined insights from these projects will advance our knowledge of the interplay among, geographical isolation, contact zone dynamics, and ecological selection in speciation. Together our results speak to how climate change has and can in the future alter evolutionary trajectories. The research provides exceptional training in evolutionary ecology for a minimum of 44 students.

"Replication of an experiment is generally considered a necessity in order to distinguish between the real effects of the factors being studied and the random variations that are typically present in the measurements.  In many settings, however, experimentation is very expensive and there are many factors that need to be studied.  Therefore, experiments may be performed on many combinations of factors without any replication.  Unreplicated experiments are often used in studying manufacturing processes, for example, that have many different possible inputs whose levels can be varied.  The goal of such processes is to manufacture items with specific properties and as little variability as possible.



Specialised statistical analysis methods have been developed to identify which factors or interactions may affect the average output of a process being studied.  Fewer, less reliable, methods have been developed for studying which factors or interactions affect the variability of the process, which are called ""dispersion effects"".  This work will result in better, more reliable methods for studying dispersion effects, thereby permitting substantially more information to be gained from unreplicated experiments than is possible with the current methods of analysis.  



Industries and other experimenters that have traditionally used unreplicated experiments will be able to identify more clearly which factors may be affecting the variability of their processes and will be better able to engineer or otherwise develop procedures that can maximize output while minimizing variability.  The impact of this work could be very broad-reaching and result in tremendous gains in efficiency in a wide range of industries and in other settings.

"Building high quality applications require an efficient access to specific knowledge. It is the case especially for software design and coding, where, software practitioners need to make decisions; they clearly need support for deciding what alternative is better for a specific context, and for identifying the effect of their decision on the quality of the software product.

In recent work on software quality, we have used machine-learning techniques to capture knowledge from data (e.g., fault prevention knowledge, impact knowledge, etc.). However, in general we have to consider informal (or semi-formal) knowledge (texts, diagrams, statements, observations, behaviors, etc.) and then we have to

structure it in order to finally formalize it and make it available for an automatic processing. A knowledge acquisition framework has to support this variety of sources; the ultimate goal of such a framework is to build knowledge bases that will support decision making for future projects.

Considering knowledge implied in the whole development process is a vast and complex challenge. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to go towards an automated solution for manipulating knowledge for (only) software design and coding. We propose a knowledge-based architecture for decision making; it assumes (i) a knowledge representation language based on objects -allowing at least to express constraints and rules, but also other formal representations-, and (ii) inference mechanisms for reasoning on this knowledge. On the other hand, this system will be built on top of an existing framework for object-oriented applications analysis. Such an architecture will allow (1) software designers/programmers exploit knowledge bases during software construction and help them taking ""right"" decisions during design/coding. It will also allow (2) more experienced software designers/programmers manage the knowledge they have learned over their practice, and store it in formal and reusable schemes. Finally, it will help (3) capture and acquire knowledge from past software development projects, by analyzing their data with appropriate techniques.

"""Ultra-efficient"" buildings are those that use 50% or less of the purchased energy of a conventional design.  A few buildings of this type would be monitored in detail to 1) evaluate performance of systems in terms of energy-efficiency and indoor environment and 2) identify approaches to further improve performance.  Experience with systems such as underfloor air distribution has shown that performance in buildings may differ significantly from performance predicted by computer simulation and full-scale mockups.  Technologies to be investigated include radiant heating and cooling, displacement ventilation, underfloor air distribution, and daylighting.  The research would be carried out by monitoring whole building and subsystem energy use, as well as by measuring thermal comfort conditions and determining ventilation effectiveness.  Buildings to be studied would include the University of Calgary's Child Development Centre and Prairieview Elementary School in Vulcan, AB, for which simulation projected 71% and 53% annual energy cost reductions respectively.

At present, the locations of these instruments have made it exceptionally inconvenient to collect data and access has been problematic.  The proposed equipment will be the only FTIR in the building with 24/7 access and consequently will be the workhorse instrument for all research groups.

"Advances in chemical synthesis allow the construction of important classes of complex molecules, including medicinal agents, advanced materials, and fine chemicals. New or improved synthetic methods can thus have immediate impact in a number of areas of research and manufacturing. Notably, transition metal complexes (i.e., catalysts) can be used to control chemical reactivity. These catalysts permit reactions previously thought to be impossible, dramatically expanding the ""toolbox"" of useful synthetic reactions. However, our understanding of how these metal complexes operate remains insufficient to reliably design new reaction methods. By understanding metal reactivity, we expect to be able to expand the scope of what is considered synthetically feasible, thereby facilitating access to a variety of molecules of biomedical and materials interest.

 

Toward this end, the proposed research involves detailed investigations of metal-catalyzed reactions. In the short term, we are developing new catalysts for a variety of catalytic reactions, including hydrothiolation, cross-coupling of aryl fluorides and asymmetric aziridination. As our studies progress, these reactions will be used for the construction of biologically-relevant complex molecules to demonstrate their utility. Ultimately, our studies are expected to uncover new or unexplored reactivity of metal complexes, providing the foundation for the design of fundamentally new reactions. This research program is expected to provide an exceptional training environment for highly qualified, creative scientists who will be employable by a number of Canadian industries.

"Understanding how life-history strategies affect fitness in migratory birds is a challenge given that individuals make decisions at numerous stages that are separated by large geographical distances and temporal spans. As such, while we have information about specific stages from various migratory species, we know little about how individuals within a species optimize strategies and trade-offs across multiple stages to maximize fitness. In particular, it is largely unknown how and why individual variation in wintering and migratory behaviour induces carry-over effects on reproductive success. Integrating information from all of these components is key to evaluating the relative direct and indirect effects of individual life-history strategies in shaping fitness in migratory species. We are examining some of these questions in snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis), a circumpolar Arctic-breeding passerine whose North American populations winter mainly in Southern Canada. We have been collecting baseline reproductive data on a Canadian population at East bay, Southampton Island, Nunavut since 2007. We will use a Geolocation-Tracking System to monitor individual variation in migratory, wintering and arrival behaviour. We will: 1) determine how variation in local climate at wintering habitats influences future reproductive success via carryover effects on body condition and reproductive timing, 2) identify whether variation in migration routes imposes temporal constraints that influence reproductive timing via changes in arrival times on the breeding grounds and 3) determine how breeding site selection influences the timing of migration and arrival. This project represents the first known attempt to follow the behaviour of individual passerines across all life-history stages. Research will provide unique insight into how individuals in this species manage spatial and temporal constraints as they move across and interact with their landscape. Furthermore, research will provide key information on how migratory species in general optimize stage-specific strategies to maximize fitness.

"The enormity of the economic and social burden of injuries due to road collisions has been cited as a global  problem of epidemic proportions.  Sustainable development is linked with road safety planning because the root cause of the road safety problem lies in a built community form that nurtures over dependence on driving.  Traditional road safety engineering has relied on a reactive approach, which works to improve road safety in reaction to identified hazardous road locations.  However, only after a collision history exists can a location be identified as hazardous and the road safety problem fixed, often after years of collisions and at high cost in built communities.  To reduce the incidence and severity of road collisions below unacceptably high current levels, researchers are pursuing more proactive methods, to explicitly consider road safety at the community planning stage, before problems occur on built roads.  However, there is a lack of reliable empirical science-based road safety planning tools to conduct this proactive approach to land use and transportation planning.  The development of macro-level collision prediction models has the potential to address this knowledge gap.  However, their development process is complex, data intensive, and time consuming, and requires extensive knowledge and use of transportation, geo-spatial, statistical, and regression modelling processes.  Research is needed to refine, automate, and facilitate their development and use by practitioners, and thereby increase the effectiveness of the proactive engineering approach to road safety planning and improvement.  The Sustainable Road Safety Engineering Research Program will provide science-based research to address this knowledge gap, via the following objectives: 1) Develop macro-level collision prediction models that facilitate sustainable development and road safety planning; 2) Develop automated processes for data extraction and development of these models that facilitate consistency in their quality and use; and, 3) Promote the transfer to and widespread use of these new empirical tools by land use and transportation planners and engineers, to remove the burden imposed by road collisions on society.

"Cold oceans are the dominant type of marine environments around Canada. These waters were typically thought of as unstable with well-mixed surface layers and homogeneous, low-diversity plankton communities. Microbes include representatives from all major branches of life: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota, which include the photosynthetic phytoplankton. These three domains interact to form complex food webs in any given parcel of water. Microbial food webs support all larger organisms dependent on Arctic Seas and are responsible for biogeochemical cycling on a global scale. The majority of free living microbes have never been cultured; we have only begun to understand the complexity of community structure by applying molecular biological techniques to investigate the ocean.  Our work focuses on identifying the diversity and abundance of microbes and several key enzymes in the Arctic Seas. The Canadian Arctic is far from being a uniform environment, for example the North Water Polynya in Northern Baffin Bay is among the worlds most productive ecosystems. In contrast the Canada Basin and much of the Beaufort Sea are oligotrophic and support very low populations of marine mammals and birds. The microbial communities in these two regions are equally contrasting. The Arctic is currently threatened with loss of ice cover due to global warming, which is impacting circulation patterns that influence microbial species distributions. Our work aims to fill fundamental gaps in our understanding of how changing circulation patterns will influence the species composition  of microbes, including phytoplankton, that support all higher trophic levels in the Arctic. Investigating the diversity and factors determining diversity contributes not only to fundamental human knowledge but is also a prerequisite for predicting the impact of climate change on biogeochemical cycles that are directly linked to microbial community structure.

Chibante. The pressure sensitive resistivity has been achieved by the incorporation of carbon nano-particles

into the silicon during fabrication. The sensitivity to pressure can be tailored during manufacture allowing the

material to be responsive to a wide range of force levels.

This project is focused on interfacing ""Smart Skin"" to a microcontroller to provide intelligent processing of

force patterns. This interface will translate and relay the touch and pressure information, from physical contact

with the material, into a format suitable to control a host of peripheral devices. An advantage of this

technology is that through the resolution of force sensing a single contact area can be used for multiple

functions. One of the obvious applications of this technology is in the area of smart cellular phones as an

alternate to conventional keyboard entry, in which each key has a single function.

As well as developing the required hardware interface to ""Smart Skin"" this pilot investigative project will also

determine the limitations of the resolution both spatially and with regard to pressure sensing capability of this

new material. To this extent pattern recognition of multiple contact points will be investigated as an alternative

communication modality.

Successful completion of this project will position Smart Skin Technologies, a New Brunswick private

company, as a key player in the development of the next generation of smart cellular phones. It is expected

that, through licensing the technology to OEMs, this will provide both employment and revenue to the

Province of New Brunswick.","Electrical and electronic machinery and equipment (including computer hardware)","Manufacturing processes and products","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Lovely, Dennis","EGP   ","Electron devices","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",1-1

"This five year NSERC Discovery Grant proposal is on high-performance computational electromagnetics (CEM) and EM inverse imaging (EMII) algorithms for biomedical applications (e.g., breast cancer imaging) and the structural-health monitoring of civil infrastructure (e.g., detection of rebar corrosion in bridge decks). Through prior research, we now have a finite-volume time-domain (FVTD) code that solves EM problems on arbitrary flat-faceted volumetric unstructured meshes which executes with a user-specifiable arbitrary order of accuracy. A new integral equation mesh truncation scheme allows us to terminate the mesh very close to the geometrical structures being modeled. This FVTD algorithm, as well as other algorithms we'll investigate as part of this proposal, will be used to (1) synthesize complex EM scattering data for our EMII research, and (2) as the forward-scattering part of the new EMII algorithms we will develop. This will require that we parallelize our CEM algorithms and implement them on the grid-computers that we currently have available. We've already investigated several EMII algorithms on scattering data collected with a vector network analyzer based ground penetrating radar system we've constructed. This has required fundamental investigations into the EM inverse problem and we've recently published a new nonlinear regularization technique based on both the distorted Born iterative technique. For the proposed research, high-resolution techniques, recently developed in the inverse-methods community, will be investigated. These include (1) the Contrast Source Inversion method, and (2) regularization methods based on the L-curve and the Normalized Cumulative Periodogram of the residual. These will be applied to the data collected using our existing GPR system as well as a new system we are developing for imaging human phantoms. Both systems will be expanded to collect transient-pulse scattering data and we will design the required transient-pulse antennas. We will also research ways of implementing the EMII techniques directly in the time-domain.","Medical and health sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Electrical and Computer Engineering","LoVetri, Joe","RGPIN ","Electrical and electronic engineering","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",3-5
"The adulteration of foods is not a new problem.  In the early 1800's unscrupulous tea traders would treat used tea leaves with black lead in order to restore colour in order to resell the leaves as fresh.  Currently, food adulteration takes many forms, including but not limited to, intentional mislabeling of geographical and botanical origins (e.g. sale of coffee grown in Mexico as originating from Columbia), product species (e.g. sale of yellowfin tuna as albacore), and debasing (the addition of less expensive ingredients).  The proposed research will investigate the role of transglycosylation and acid reversion reactions on the formation of fingerprint oligosaccharides as markers for botanical and species origins of honey, and sweetener identification.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Food and Bioproduct Sciences","Low, Nicholas","RGPIN ","Food chemistry and analysis","Food science and technology","Science et technologie de l'alimentation",3-3

"Bacteria produce a range of carbohydrate-containing molecules with an impressive array of structural diversity. These glycoconjugates play critical roles in the life cycle of bacterial organisms, often modulating interactions with their environment.  We will continue our work in the general area of bacterial glycans, and extend these investigations to new systems including plants. Three topics will be explored.

1. Synthetic Oligosaccharides as Tools for Studying Campylobacter jejuni Capsular Polysaccharide Biosynthesis.  Campylobacter jejuni is an important food-borne pathogen and recent structural work has elucidated that bioactive polysaccharides produced by the organism have a variety of novel motifs.  Among the most interesting are methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) moieties, which are rare in nature.  We will synthesize fragments of the these polysaccharides for use in biosynthetic investigations focused on the origin of MeOPN groups.  Also developed will be methodology for synthesizing what has been proposed to be the biosynthetic precursor, a CMP derivative. 

2.  Synthesis and Immunological Activity of Phenolic Glycolipids from Mycobacteria. Phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) are found in the cell wall of a number of mycobacterial strains including M. tuberculosis and M. leprae, the organism that causes leprosy. Sixteen unique PGLs have been isolated from pathogenic mycobacteria. Although known for many years, these molecules have attracted increased recent attention. We hypothesize that dissecting the biological roles of PGLs will be facilitated by access to a panel of synthetic PGLs analogues. We will prepare these compounds and then test their ability to modulate cytokine production. 

3. Probing Oligofuranoside-Protein Interactions. The recognition of L-arabinofuranose-containing glycans by an L-arabinofuranoside will be characterized.  We will use available X-ray data combined with chemical synthesis, binding studies and molecular biology to probe the recognition of carbohydrates containing five-membered rings by proteins. This is an area that has received very little attention.

"Insects transmit parasites that cause significant disease to humans and animals. Devastating diseases such as malaria, lymphatic filariasis kill 2-3 million people per year and viruses such as Dengue and West Nile virus cause illness or death in millions more. Our research addresses the molecular interactions between insect vectors and the pathogens they transmit. Most insects kill parasites that enter their bodies using components of their immune system. This response is based in a large part on the production of small peptides that bind to, and kill, bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites. The parasite first must be recognized as ""non-self"" which initiates the expression of immune factors. This proposal will look at the immune response of Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Trypanosoma cruzi that infects 18 million people in North, Central and South America. This parasite is unique in that it has modified its life-cycle to avoid entering regions of the insect where immune responses are strongest. We will characterize molecules involved in non-self recognition, activation, regulation and expression of immune peptides in this vector in response to infections with bacteria fungi, and parasites, and will identify novel peptides that are lethal to these organisms. We will also determine the role of these molecules by silencing their expression to see if parasite numbers change or if the insects themselves die. Ultimately we would like to determine if we can stop parasite development, and therefore stop transmission, or if we can identify and evaluate these molecules as potential drugs to treat people with bacterial and parasitic infections.

"Mantle Convection in the Earth and Terrestrial Planets



The objective of this proposal is to gain insight into how surface boundary conditions and system geometry affect the thermal structure of a terrestrial planet. The latter subject includes comparisons of the behaviour of two- and three-dimensional systems, differences between convection in plane layer (Cartesian) systems and fluids contained within self-gravitating spherical shells and the effect of core radius on thermal structure in spherical shell systems. The influence of the mantle's mechanical boundary conditions on planetary thermal evolution will be considered by examining the dynamic feedback between plate motion and mantle convection. A specific focus of the research will be the time-dependence of surface motion, planetary heat flow, core heat flow and planetary secular cooling. Phenomena to be investigated will include the supercontinent cycle, the influence of plates on mantle planform and the motion of mantle plumes. Implications for the thermal evolution of the Earth and Venus resulting from their differing surface characteristics will also be examined. The research planned will be conducted by employing 3D numerical models run on parallel-architecture high-performance computer clusters. New modelling to be undertaken will feature dynamically evolving plates in 3D mantle convection simulations incorporating distinct continental and oceanic lithosphere in solution domains scaled to the Earth's surface area. Planned spherical geometry modelling will focus on simulations of the secular cooling of planetary mantles with implications for geodynamos and the effect of surface boundary conditions on global thermal characteristics. The research involved will train a new generation of Canadian geodynamicists on the use of parallel-architecture computing for investigating problems in geodynamics and fluid mechanics.

"The goal of the research and development project is the creation of effective tools for robust engineering design leading to the increased productivity of design engineers. The immediate application of these tools is to low frequency electromagnetic devices and systems, including power generators (hydro, wind, steam, etc.), electric motors (for hybrid vehicles, industrial machinery, domestic equipment, portable devices, computer systems, etc.), actuators (including MEMS devices), sensing systems and non-destructive testing techniques (such as is used in oil and gas pipelines; nuclear power stations and aircraft inspection). Enhanced design tools will improve the manufacturing yield of mass produced devices as well as making possible increases in the efficiencies of electromechanical energy conversion. The construction of appropriate design tools requires research in several areas of computational analysis including multi-objective optimization, multi-physics field solutions and performance evaluation. In addition, developments in soft computing (i.e. knowledge based systems) have the potential for accelerating numerical analysis techniques and providing a basis for device synthesis from design specifications. The merging of these areas will provide a novel and unique computer based design capability which will be based around the new hardware environment of multi-core processors and massive memories. Many of the intermediate objectives have applications outside the primary research area and will contribute to the development of tools for the support of engineering design in general.

    )	The primary objectives of the proposal are to:

1.    )	Investigate optimization and analysis algorithms using multi-core processors.

2.    )	Develop a device synthesis approach incorporating a case-based reasoning system.

3.    )	Implement analysis and optimization systems incorporating parameter uncertainties.

4.    )	Improve the performance of multi-objective optimizers by incorporating surrogate models and sensitivity analysis.

"My research focuses on ice, one of the ubiquitous aspects of life in Canada. It becomes our enemy in the form of slippery sidewalks and streets, ice accumulating on aircraft and freezing rain building up on electrical lines. But it is also the friend of hockey players and fans, skaters, bobsledders and lovers of most winter sports. This research proposal examines both aspects of ice, with the intention of improving some of its beneficial aspects and mitigating some of its undesirable characteristics.



First, we will look at ice in the form of freezing rain and ice accumulating on aircraft. The build-up of ice on electrical transmission and distribution lines during a five-day ice storm in January 1998, caused hundreds of towers and poles to topple and left millions of Canadians and Americans without power for up to a week. There were several resulting deaths and insurance companies have estimated the overall economic cost to exceed three billion dollars. Icing on aircraft causes all-too-familiar delays and disruptions and it still leads to numerous accidents, some of them fatal, every year. My research involves building better computer models of icing and combining them with weather prediction models, in order to provide better forecasts and warnings to the public, and to aviation and electrical distribution agencies.



Second, we will look at the friction force of ice in Winter sports, particularly speedskating and bobsled. Ice friction slows down winter athletes, both competitive and recreational. My research involves finding ways to measure ice friction, particularly in speedskating. Once we are able to measure ice friction during skating, we will be able to test new ideas for reducing ice friction, by improving the skates, ice and skating techniques. These improvements could help to make Canadian athletes faster in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and to make skating easier and more enjoyable for hockey players and recreational skaters across Canada.

"Web is not only delivering data for humans to read, it is also emerging as a platform that provides machine-readable information, thus enabling the creation of new functionalities composed from existing web services and web programmable APIs. In order to support the systematic and disciplined development of such compositions, there is a need to study the methods and tools oriented to such web applications. Moreover, many web services compositions and customizations are closely related to our daily lives, hence they can be carried out by ordinary computer users as well as professional programmers. Since these computer users have little programming knowledge, it is more important to provide automated or interactive support to produce composite services. 



The project will study the problems related to the construction of a web service programming environment for novice programmers. First, we will construct a repository of web services and other reusable web components, based on which we can carry out the experiments. Then various service search methods are investigated, in order to facilitate the reuse of the components, either manually by programmers or automatically by service synthesizers. Finally, those search methods will be used to construct interactive and automated web service composition systems. 



For interactive web service composition, we will develop a service broker that has a good command of the services on the web, as well as the programming requirements from the service assembler. Service broker will watch over the shoulders of the service assembler and acquire the knowledge of the context where the service will be used, hence will be able to recommend the services to be used in the next step. This work will be based on various software component reuse techniques such as source code searching and recommendation. 



For automated web service composition, we will focus on services wrapped from legacy database systems and annotated with SQL queries. With those services we can synthesize the implementation of a web service using database query rewriting.","Computer software","Information and communication services","Computer Science, School of","Lu, Jianguo","RGPIN ","Software engineering","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",2-5

"Reliability and safety are primary concerns with industrial systems, especially in safety-critical applications. People are reluctant to adopt new technologies, if there is any uncertainty that it might endanger public safety. Therefore, reliability and safety assessment is of paramount importance for the successful application of new technologies in safety-critical engineering systems. 



Wireless Networked Control System (WNCS) is an emerging technology that links system nodes (sensors, controllers and actuators) through a wireless communication network. There are many advantages of WNCS over conventional control systems: lower costs, less maintenance, faster deployment, and more flexibility. However, when a wireless network is introduced into a control system, many challenges arise. This research program aims to investigate the reliability and safety of WNCS, and to improve its performance through risk-informed decision-making involving communication scheduling and controller design.



This research program will have potential benefits to several industries in Canada. For example, the nuclear industry is heavily burdened by costs associated with cables. The aerospace industry desires lighter controllers. Wireless networked control could be highly advantageous for these industries. The reliability and safety assessment performed in this research will gain a fundamental understanding of reliability and safety of WNCS and build confidence, when adopting such systems in industrial applications. 



This research program will also provide training opportunities for M.A.Sc. and Ph.D. students. These graduate students will gain valuable experience in reliability and safety assessment, as well as simulation and experimental design of WNCS.

"This research program investigates silica microtoroid and its applications to ultra narrow linewidth laser and single molecule detection.



Silica microtoroid has demonstrated a quality factor of five hundred million, the highest on a silicon chip, since its invention in 2003.  In this proposal, the microtoroid will be applied to generate ultra narrow linewidth lasers at the sub Hertz level.  Up to date, I have demonstrated a microtoroid Raman laser with a fundamental linewidth at Hertz level, while technical frequency noises of tens of Hz^2/Hz are observed at the low frequency part of the spectrum.  I will investigate the technical noises observed at low frequencies through analytical and numerical modeling and propose noise reduction techniques to achieve sub Hertz linewidth.  The microtoroid Raman laser will then be tailored into a robust split frequency sensor for single molecule detection.  Split frequency is the frequency difference of the twin resonant modes in a silica toroid.  A protein molecule that binds on the surface of a toroid will increase the split frequency in the order of kilohertz on average, well above the target split frequency sensing resolution of the toroid Raman laser with linewidth at the sub Hertz level.  This work will be carried out in collaboration with the Fraser Biomedical Group and the Vahala Research Group at California Institute of Technology.



The successful completion of this proposal will result in an unprecedented ultra narrow linewidth microtoroid laser with broad applications to integrated devices and systems for coherent communication, high resolution biosensing, and high precision optical clock source, etc.  The cutting edge research effort will elevate Canada's leadership position in the highly competitive nanophotonics and biophotonics and train the highly qualified personnel in these fields.

"For sustainable economic development globally, the ironmaking process based on blast furnace has to change for better environment protection and energy efficiency in the future, however, existing blast furnaces will remain to be operational for some time due to the fact that it will take huge amount of capital to replace it.  Two projects are proposed here, one is aimed to improve the efficiency of blast furnace and the other is aimed for the development of new processes and the control of RHF.



(1) Force Balance in the Interior of Blast Furnace (PhD thesis, Mr.D. Pomeroy)



Mathematical models of blast furnace, based on principles in Fluid Mechanics and Soil Mechanics( a cold model first and followed by a hot model) are being built to study physical phenomena in the interior. The effort is pioneering in nature and results would be influential in the control of the operation for stable, safe, efficient and long campaign life practice.



(2) Kinetics of Reduction of Iron Ore in Ore/Coal Composite Agglomerates ( A graduate student or a post-doctorate fellow) 



Ore/coal composites are relatively new on the ironmaking scene.  It has been in general accepted as the preferred starting material (for the elimination of coking and high temperature agglomeration) for all types alternative new processes. The system consists of not only gas-solid reactions involving iron oxides, but also carbonization and carbon gasification, steep temperature gradient and viscous flows.  The results of this fundamental study will be useful in the improvement in the control of Rotary Hearth Furnace and in the development of new ironmaking processes.

"My research interests for the next few years will be primarily focused on developing adaptive statistical methods and investigating their theoretical properties for the analysis of large and complex datasets.



In the context of complex surveys, protecting sensitive information from disclosure has become more and more challenging as the magnitude of such surveys increases. Specific methodologies may involve constructing nearly-orthogonal mixed-level arrays, which by itself is an interesting research problem in the area of modern experimental design, especially when designing input settings for complex computer simulators, as the realistic surrogate to the much more complex physical phenomena, is desired.



It is also worth noticing that the issues of maintaining confidentiality in large data warehouses, closely related to the above-mentioned research problem, has drawn significant interests after data-mining techniques have been widely used by government agencies and businesses in processing public access data that also includes sensitive information. In particular, I intend to explore issues relating to algorithmic strategies in the area of privacy-preserving data-mining research and expect the results to be quite influential to industries involved in data-mining.

"In medicine, economics, social science, engineering and other fields, practitioners are often faced with problems of exploring the relationship between an outcome variable and a set of covariates for prediction purposes. The standard statistical methods are often not directly available to solve the problems due to censored and missing data. Censored and missing data arise in almost all scientific disciplines. For example, in a clinical trial, the investigators are interested in evaluating the effect of a treatment on survival in HIV-1 seropositive drug users, adjusted for other predictive covariates such as BMI (body mass index) and age. Some patients may be still alive when the study terminates and their survival times are censored. In another example, autopsy for some patients may not be carried out and the failure causes are unknown. In this situation, some values of censoring indicators are missing. In many cases, people just simply delete records for which any data are censored or missing, and conduct the so-called ""complete-case analysis"". Such an analysis can lead to severe biases and wrong conclusions. Moreover, there may be many covariates and it is difficult to select important ones. For instance, investigators need to select active genes to predict patients' survival in microarray analysis. There is a challenge of high dimensionality of the gene expression data. This proposal is to develop semiparametric models to address all the issues arising from the aforementioned real applications. Semiparametric models are the models that include both a parametric and nonparametric component. Such models allow flexible covariate effects; they play the role of dimension reduction and avoid the curse of dimensionality; estimators in such models are more robust and efficient than in traditional parametric models and pure nonparametric models. Therefore, it is challenging and rewarding to work on semiparametric models. The outcomes of the proposed research will make contributions to the development of statistical theory and help bring the benefits of prosperity to all Canadians. In addition, the research will contribute significantly to the training of highly qualified young Canadian professionals.

"The nature of the insurance business is the promise by the insurer to pay all claims of the insured that are covered in exchange for a policy premium. In addition, the insurer commits some capital (surplus) to assure that the promise will be kept even under special circumstances. We study a portfolio within the insurance company with a positive allocated initial risk reserve (fund) at the beginning of the considered period. The risk reserve is credited premiums with a constant rate and debited amounts of claims due at the time of the arrival. When the claim arrivals are modeled by a Poisson process, the risk reserve process is the so-called classical risk process. We are concerned about the possibility that the insurer does not have enough funds to pay its liabilities (claims), which is the case when the risk reserve falls below zero. More precisely, when this happens we want to know what the odds are for this to happen within a finite time period and what the worse-case scenario would be. These are the basic risk-related quantities of my interest. 



In practice, the cases where the premium rate is constant over time and the claim arrivals under a constant intensity rate (Poisson process case) are not so realistic. Some general situations have to be taken into considerations, for example, the reserve-dependent premiums. In this proposal, I intend to study the effect of the premium income pattern to the insurer's reserve and the solvency-dependent problems by evaluating the dynamics of the risk reserve of the insurance company subject to stochastic fluctuations from the external environment such as the economic situations. We choose the continuous-time Markov process to model the random environment which affects the insurance business. We also discuss the application of the model to real insurance related data showing how our theoretical results can be useful in practice.

"In a cone programming problem, a linear function of variables is minimized subject to linear equality constraints on the variables and the essential constraint that the variables are in a closed convex cone. Cone programming, especially semidefinite program (SDP), problems arise in many applications in engineering, sciences, finance and statistics. Thus, it is of paramount importance to develop efficient and reliable algorithms to solve them.



This proposal aims at the development of the theory and implementation of algorithms for cone programs and also investigates the applications of cone programs. The objectives of this proposal consist of: 1) developing high-performance polynomially and superlinearly convergent primal-dual interior-point (IP) methods for SDP and other cone programs; 2) developing second-order IP algorithms based on iterative linear solvers for SDP and more general cone programs; 3) developing new and/or improving existing algorithms and implementations for first-order smooth and non-smooth methods for SDP and more general cone programming problems; in particular, developing new primal-dual first-order methods for these problems; 4) exploring wide applications of cone programs in robust portfolio selection and statistical decision.



The anticipated impact of the proposed research is: 1) to provide new insight into the behavior of second-order primal-dual IP algorithms and first-order smooth and non-smooth methods for SDP and more general cone programs; 2) to develop and distribute efficient implementations that will enable practitioners to solve small- to large-scale SDP and more general cone programming problems arising in diverse applications; 3) to provide wide applications of cone programs for robust portfolio selection and statistical decision, and to distribute efficient and user-friendly softwares for solving complex decision problems arising from these areas.

"As a naturally occurring substance and a newly discovered allotropy of carbons, fullerenes are topologically perfect nanostructures with well-defined sizes. The most abundant nanostructured carbon is C60, where 60 carbon atoms are bonded into a spherical ball which is often referred to as bucky-ball. The name fullerenes, was coined after the American architect R. Buckminster Fuller who was known for his many innovative architectural constructions based on pentagons and hexagons, the very same geometric building blocks for various forms of nanocarbons. C60's physical properties and potential applications have been among the most studied subjects in the last two decades. High electron mobility of C60 thin-film materials is perhaps the most important physical properties promising revolutionary applications in electronic devices such as field-effect transistors and optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes. Carbon nanotechnology is considered by many as one of the major technology platform to surpass silicon technology which is rapidly approaching many fundamental limits. Despite many progresses have been made in fullerene research, in particular in developing many diverse forms of fullerene derivatives for chemical and biomedical applications, the collective electronic phenomena of solid fullerene thin-film materials are not clear. This has been a major barrier in developing and commercialization of fullerene-based electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this application, Prof. Z.H. Lu puts forward a leading edge research program, involving a team of five energetic graduate student researchers, to conquer the challenges in practical application of fullerene-based thin-films and devices. The proposed research topics are: 1) engineering of robust fullerene-based thin-films; 2) strategies in controlling surface and interface formation; 3) understanding charge transport in thin-films and heterostructures; and 4) development of fullerene-based thin-film transistors.

"The technological realization of high-quality and high-density InAs-based self-assembled quantum-dot (QD) semiconductor gain material around 1550 nm offers many new possibilities. As compared with the conventional bulk / quantum-well (QW) based semiconductor or rare-earth-doped fiber gain materials, the advantages of the QD-based waveguide gain materials are: much broader spectral bandwidths, low lasing threshold current densities, high temperature stability, strongly reduced linewidth enhancement factor, small power consumption, large saturated output power, low chirp behaviors at high speed modulation, much better back-reflection insensitivity, independent multi-wavelength and pattern-free amplification. The significance of this proposal is that utilizing the above mentioned special properties /advantages to develop novel QD-based semiconductor waveguide devices and their applications.



This research proposal aims to exploit InAs/InGaAsP QD gain materials around 1550 nm and their specific device applications for all-optical networking systems. In more specialties, the main objectives of this proposal are: 1) In the short term, to characterize and investigate the NRC-home-made different-structure QD-SOAs and QW-SOAs in order to understand their different physic mechanisms. To develop an ultra-broadband QD-based SOAs which cover S-, C- and L-band for CWDM systems; 2) In the mid-term, to investigate and demonstrate high saturation power and multi-wavelength amplification of QD-SOAs. In more specialties, to focus on solving the polarization sensitivity issues, investigating gain pattern effects and increasing the saturation output power; 3) In the long term, to investigate and develop novel all-optical wavelength conversion and multicasting systems based on non-degenerate four-wave mixing process in QD-SOAs. At the same time, we will work on theoretical modeling in order to guide our QD-SOA design and to understand the properties of QD-SOAs with specifications clearly exceeding currently available QW-SOA performance.

"This project will develop and characterize a family of ceramic composites for use within the investigated structural sandwich panel system.  The ceramic composites are to be formed using a chemically reacted magnesium/phosphate binder system in combination with industrial waste ash and lightweight expanded clay aggregates.  The rheological and mechanical properties of the ceramic composites will be characterized based on standardized test procedures adopted from the concrete industry. Analytical relationships will be developed between the mix proportions, the mix procedures and the obtained properties.  In later stages of the project, structural panels formed from alternating layers of the ceramic composites and glass fibre reinforcing fabrics will be developed and tested to failure under bending.  The influence of panel composition and panel configuration on the structural behaviour will be examined.  Analytical models which can accurately represent the strength and stiffness of the panels will be developed based on the measured mechanical properties of the constiuent materials. By considering possible replacement of non-structural Oriented Strand Board or Plywood sheathing in house construction as a target application, large-scale panels will be developed for implementation in field trials.

"Existing shear design models for reinforced concrete use a stress-based compositional approach to member strength, from both a concrete contribution and from a shear reinforcement contribution based on a truss analogy.  These models limit the maximum strength of the shear reinforcement permitted in design, in order to limit crack widths at failure.  Maximum spacing of the shear reinforcement is defined by empirical rules based on an assumed angle for the internal truss.  Limited studies since the 1960's have shown that safe designs are possible when either of these criteria are relaxed.  Improved capacity models for shear that directly consider both the shear reinforcement strains and spacing, will permit economical and safe use of modern, durable reinforcement materials as stirrups.

     This study will investigate influences on shear capacity from the longitudinal spacing of shear reinforcement, through laboratory and numerical studies.  Shear reinforcement arrangements representative of new construction will be considered, along with shear dowel configurations suitable for rehabilitation applications.  The influence of higher stirrup strains at failure, resulting from the use of high strength steel or fibre reinforced polymer materials, will also be considered.  A special emphasis in experimental investigations will be placed on configurations where little existing test data is available, including large members with wide reinforcement spacing.

     Non-linear numerical models, the new test data, and a critical examination of existing design methods will permit development of a new strain-based shear design approach which can account for stirrup spacing, in combination with the stirrup mechanical properties.  This model will permit more innovative detailing to occur in practice, for members with sparsely spaced high performance reinforcing materials.  Furthermore, the ability to predict the capacity of existing members will be improved, thereby minimizing unnecessary and costly rehabilitation.

"Peptides and more importantly their related mimics, both serve as effective drugs in clinic today.  Prominent traditional examples include oxytocin, insulin, cyclosporin and salmon calcitonin, which are widely used in childbirth, diabetes, immunosuppression and osteoporosis, respectively. At present more than 40 peptides are marketed worldwide, around 270 peptides are in clinical phase testing, and about 400 are in advanced preclinical phases (Marx, V. ""Watching Peptide Drugs Grow Up"" Chem. & Eng. News Mar. 14, 2005, Vol 83 (11) pp. 17-24).  A new age of peptide-based pharmaceutical agents is emerging from fertile studies in genomics and proteomics. Inherent drawbacks to peptide structures have, however, required development of novel tools for studying peptide interactions and new peptide mimics with improved pharmacological properties to surmount the necessary hurdles to enter into clinic.  Such has been the case for new peptide-based drugs, such as the GnRH antagonist Zoladex for treating prostate cancer, which was made more resistant to enzyme metabolism by incorporating an aza-amino acid at the C-terminal residue. Similarly, Symlin a new drug for the treatment of diabetes contains a synthetic analog of a naturally occurring human peptide hormone, amylin. Promising peptide-based drugs for the future include vaccines against various cancers and malaria as well as novel antimicrobial agents to fight organisms exhibiting resistance to present day drugs.  The process from peptide to drug is, however, particularly challenging and diagnostic tools for dissecting the native peptide are required to furnish information for recreating elements required for receptor recognition and signal transduction.  This proposal focuses on the creation of such tools and their use to construct mimics exhibiting higher potency, enhanced metabolic stability and improved biological availability relative to the native peptide. Because the number of peptides serving as lead structures for drug discovery continues to grow, the proposed research on new strategies for creating peptide mimics is positioned to provide valuable insight and practical leads for the future production of new drugs, biopolymers and materials.

"The goal of this proposal is to develop efficient algorithms, to implement them in a software package for validation and wide dissemination, and to apply them in a variety of fields, especially optimization, with a special focus on the intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning (IMRT) optimization problem. 

      The research focuses on Computer-Aided Convex Analysis, which consists of investigating new algorithms to compute and visualize fundamental transforms in convex analysis. The resulting framework will allow researchers to perform experimental mathematics in convex analysis (and related fields), and to improve current optimization algorithms. To facilitate research investigations, and the training of graduate and undergraduate students in convex analysis, the algorithms will be released as a toolbox. They will allow fast visualization of convex transforms, the quick validation of conjectures, and the clear illustration of theorems.

      The results, both theoretical and numerical, will be used on deterministic global optimization algorithms. The improvements will then be applied to the problem of intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) planning. IMRT uses geometrically shaped and intensity modulated radiation beams to treat cancer tumours with more accurate and more effective doses of radiation.  So the research has the potential to improve cancer treatment by providing more accurate treatment plans in a shorter time. It will take advantage of an ongoing collaboration with the BC cancer agency through the Kelowna cancer clinic, which offers radiotherapy treatment to the population of the Okanagan. 

      Two other fields that use the same convex analysis calculus, and so will benefit from more efficient algorithms, are Network Communication and Image Processing. The improvements resulting from the new algorithms will be applied to speed up current calculations in these fields.

"Canada's forest sector is actively seeking ways to develop the ""green"" economy. This collaborative project between Lakehead University FoReST Laboratory and Alterna Biocarbon will investigate the potential for biochar (from wood and/or agricultural waste) to augment forest productivity while simultaneously sequestering carbon in a stable form. This combination of a renewable resource with a highly efficient carbonization technology has the potential to contribute to a carbon negative cycle - that is, to store more carbon than it releases. Known as ""terra preta"" in highly weathered soils of the tropics, the addition of biochar has been shown to enhance vegetative growth by improvement of the soil. Specifically, retention and release

of nutrients, modification of pH, improved aeration and structure can mean reduced need for fertilizers and other soil amendments. This project is unique in Canada in that we will utilize northern forest soils. Through a carefully designed series of soil microcosms, we will determine if the addition of biochar results in changes in nutrient mobility. This is a first step to assisting Alterna Biocarbon in their quest to develop a forest sector specific soil amendment.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Forestry and the Forest Environment, Faculty of","Luckai, Nancy","EGP   ","Fertility of soils","Soil science","Science du sol",1-1
"Intensive silviculture (IS) may resolve some of the challenges currently facing industrial forestry and the landbase that supports it in Canada. These challenges include a short-term over- commitment of commercial fibre, calls for more protected spaces and demand for an increasing variety of products, including high quality wood. IS prescriptions are based on assumptions about the nature of competition in boreal forest systems. First, that the majority of site resources can be effectively directed to crop trees (competitive exclusion) and that some species mixtures better partition the resources available (competitive production). Our project investigates two hypotheses that will address these assumptions and provide guidance for the development of more effective IS interventions. We will use a series of four established trials, in northwestern and northeastern Ontario, at three critical stages of stand development - establishment (5 years), crown closure (20 years) and mature (over 100 years). Historical datasets will be supplemented by new field and laboratory work to capture better estimates of above- and below-ground parameters including root structure and stratification. DNA bar coding will be used to identify root and fungal tissues. Mensurational and process-based data will provide the basis for a new tree-level model that will be linked to tree height and/or crown dimension. Our private sector partners, Tembec Inc and the Forest Research Partnership, require such a model to predict the effects of IS strategies on target species and other key ecosystem parameters (e.g. soil organic matter, nutrient mineralization rates, tree layer productivity). Our public sector partners, Ontario Forest Research Institute and the Canadian Forest Service, require this science to inform the development of forest management policy. All our partners will participate fully in the collection of data, the development of the model and the supervision/mentoring of graduate students and other HQP.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Forestry and the Forest Environment, Faculty of","Luckai, Nancy","STPGP ","Terrestrial ecology","Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",3-3
"The most critical impacts of ongoing and future climate changes in the Canadian Cordillera and adjacent prairies will be related to the availability of water for irrigation, hydro power, human consumption, etc. in times of increased demand. This project examines the spatial and temporal variability of components of the hydrological cycle in selected regions of the Canadian Cordillera by developing tree-ring reconstructions of past hydroclimate and snowpack variability, examination of changes in the instrumental streamflow record and documentation of recent changes in glacier cover. Recent studies from the US have shown marked reductions in winter snowpack, earlier streamflow timing and changes in the seasonal distribution of flows during the last 50 years that could critically affect summer flows. Ongoing studies show these strong coherent regional patterns of variation in winter snowpack, glacier mass balance and summer streamflow are driven by variations in the PDO, ENSO and global temperatures. A critical element of the project will be to identify those tree species with tree-ring series sensitive to winter precipitation or snowpack in order to develop hydrologically realistic reconstructions of summer streamflows. It will also develop estimates of recent (in some cases annual) recession of selected glaciers for the past few decades. These studies will contribute to a new international, interdisciplinary Collaborative Research Network funded by IAI that examines hydroclimatic variability in the cordillera of North America, Mexico, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina.

This project will also continue previous long term studies using tree-rings and glacier fluctuations to investigate climate history, variability and change in the Canadian Cordillera. Studies using a new database of over 150 chronologies will reconstruct temperature variability across the Yukon for the last 2-300 years. These chronologies can also be used to provide precise calendar ages for glacier advances and other major environmental changes within the Yukon.

"Opening the black box of organic matter (O.M.) and distinguishing specific organic compounds enables to get a better grasp on the complex dynamics of environmental drawbacks.  Two main objectives are pursued: i) a fundamental one consisting in expanding and exploiting the know-how of my research team in the characterization of organic compounds, ii) a transversal one aiming at applying this sophisticated procedure to the understanding of the fine dynamics of environmental issues dealt with in my ongoing large interdisciplinary research.  I first wish to expand our bank of recognizable organic molecules, ranging from lignocellulosic and cutin compounds to bacterial biomarkers thanks to spectrometry (MS-MS) identification of phenols issuing from the CuO digestion of O.M.  On one hand of the applied axis, I intend to elucidate the nature of specific organic compounds as key-factors in triggering mercury methylation in relation with the biogeographical characteristics of the drainage basin and the trophic structure of an aquatic ecosystem.  On the other hand, I shall work on the elucidation of the intensity and duration of greenhouse gas production by boreal hydroelectric reservoirs, detailing the respective contributions of the degradation of labile fractions of flooded O.M., new biological production and terrigenous inputs from the drainage basin.  Finally, I propose to deepen our quest for the understanding of the environmental consequences of massive slashing and burning of the Amazon rain forest by identifying specific terrigenous organic compounds of tropical soils that could represent potential carriers of mercury-rich particles.  Several outcomes are expected from this research, ranging from establishing a general Ecosystem Sensitivity Index of the various cases of mercury contamination across Canada, to making enlightened choices about future means of energy production, and to defining appropriate measures that could be proposed for slowing deforestation of tropical forests. On an annual basis, about ten graduate students are usually involved at various degrees with this research axis of identification of specific organic compounds and elucidating their dynamics in given environmental issues.

"The term ""Appropriate Technology"" was coined in 1973 by Fritz Schumacher in ""Small is Beautiful: economics as if people matter"".  Appropriate Technology describes a way of providing for human needs with the least impact on the Earth's finite resources.  Thus the term is often tied to terms such as sustainable development and Green chemistry.  However, the term applies equally well to the analytical laboratory where we too face finite capital budgets and limited staffing.  My research seeks to extend the capabilities of separation techniques such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ion chromatography (IC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) to a broader range of applications while maintaining flexibility and minimizing expense and complexity.    



The approach my group takes is to develop a fundamental physico-chemical understanding of the methodology.  We then use that understanding to enhance and even simplify the analytical methods.  Examples of our recent work are the development of: a fundamental understanding of electrophoretic mobility; a class of self-assembled coatings based on supported phospholipid bilayers for preventing protein adsorption in CE; sensitive fluorescence detectors based on inexpensive diode lasers and dirt-cheap light emitting diodes; IC methods that are 20-times faster than conventional methods; and high efficiency low pressure IC methodologies.  Many of these efforts will continue.  New areas introduced in this proposal include: conductivity spectrum probe; electrically switched ion exchange; and analytical methodologies based on electromigration of microbes.

"The long-term objective of this research program is the vision of services that are autonomous platform-independent computational elements that can be described, published, discovered, orchestrated and programmed using standard protocols for the purpose of building agile networks of collaborating service applications distributed within and across organizational boundaries. However, before this service-oriented computing paradigm becomes reality, there are a number of challenging issues that need to be addressed including among other things service modeling and design methodologies, architectural approaches, service development, deployment and composition, programming and evolution of services and their supporting technologies and infrastructure. The key to this is an infrastructure where all services, are adequately described in a form that is machine-processable, leading to semantic interoperability and automation.



This research program addresses fundamental computer science issues by identifying the nature of provenance, by defining the means of generating it, and by offering reasoning mechanisms based on provenance. However, a number of fundamental research issues still remain. First of all, the principle design of provenance data, and the understanding of their role in reasoning are crucial to deliver a provenance model that is relevant to workflow enactment. Then provenance data generation is a cooperative process that requires the agreement of multiple parties involved in workflow enactment; such parties need to adhere to a common protocol. Furthermore, the specific properties of such a protocol will determine the quality of the provenance data generated, and therefore the level of trust that scientists can have in such data. Finally, the engineering of a provenance architecture suitable for a Grid context needs to be addressed, and must take into account the dynamic and open nature of such an environment, but also some of the domain performance requirements.

"As the energy sector transitions to more sustainable solutions, this initiative addresses stationary and, possibly transitioning into, mobile energy applications. The Renewable Energy Conversion and Storage Research (RECSR) initiative will increase the capacity for Lambton College and its industrial partners to undertake applied research, development and commercialization activities in the area of renewable energy generation, conversion, storage, supply. Since energy generated by renewable sources is intermittent and, in case of wind energy, often produced at times when not required, this research initiative will explore how to buffer the resulting electrical output and release it on demand. The R&D activities at Lambton College will examine the integration of renewable energy generation technologies and will explore the viability of a hydrogen-based energy storage & production infrastructure with the goal of optimizing the energy related assets.



A critical element will be the development of an Energy Management Controller (EMC) that enables the outputs of the renewable energy sources to be used directly, remain stored in the proposed media, or be released on demand from the storage media. Hydrogen offers the longest viable energy storage. The proposed research activities include the generation of hydrogen via electrolysis and photocatalysis using doped titania nanotubes. Generated hydrogen will be used to feed fuel cells to generate electricity on demand. It is expected to apply the developed technology into multiple sectors such as the renewable energy sector and the mobile or stationary emergency power back-up market.

"Every year, millions of tonnes of organic waste are generated from municipal (green bin waste and biosolids), commercial (food and beverage production), and agricultural residues (crop residues such as straw and corn stover). This potentially valuable material is often underutilized and left to decompose in landfills and contributes to the release of greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. The objective of the proposed research is to develop an integrated process to make use of the potential of this organic waste to create value-added energy products such as ethanol and hydrogen. The research will lead to the development of a low-cost method utilizing waste biomass to produce biofuel in a more sustainable way than current practices. 



The research program involves the development of a two-stage hybrid treatment process for residential ""Source-Separated Organics (SSO)"", also known as the ""green bin"" waste. The first stage involves the pre-treatment of the SSO, using high temperature and pressure, and turn it into a stable, sterilized product with low moisture, which is odour-free and has a long shelf life. Following pre-processing, the key secondary unit of this process is a bioreactor where a newly-identified and highly efficient bacterium converts the sugars released in the pre-processed SSO into ethanol under anaerobic conditions. Results of this research will provide scientific evidence to promote the diversion of more organics of our solid waste from landfills, with significant contributions to the reduction of air and water pollution, and provide economic benefits to Canada by exploring an alternative energy source production. This research is particularly timely in light of rising fossil fuel prices, looming shortage of landfill space, and Canada's growing concerns over pollution.

"The concept of duality dates back to the time of the French mathematician Evariste Galois (1811-1832), who formulated the criterion for solubility of polynomial equations in a single variable by radicals (n-th roots). At the heart of Galois' solution lies a correspondence between the algebraic structures containing some of the solutions of a given polynomial (called ""intermediate field extensions"") and substructures of an algebraic structure invented by Galois that is typical to the polynomial (the ""Galois group"" of the polynomial). An important property of this correspondence is that it reverses the inclusion relation: The larger the intermediate field extension is, the smaller the corresponding substructure is, and vice versa. Although dualities frequently occur in mathematics, they are less often recognized as such. For instance, the starting point of affine algebraic geometry is a duality between sets zero-sets of polynomials in several variables (""algebraic sets"") and sets of polynomials with special properties (""radical ideals""). The main feature common to all meaningful dualities is the collection of pairs of dual properties, that is, pairs (P,Q) such that an object satisfies P if and only if its dual possesses Q. The long-term goal of the proposed research is discovering a duality for topological groups with sufficiently many interesting pairs of properties (P,Q) of the above-mentioned type. I do not rule out the possibility that such duality does not exist, in which case, I hope to prove that it is impossible to construct such a duality. In the course of this project, I anticipate to also investigate mathematical objects that are closely related to quantum-mechanics (namely, operator algebras and their generalizations). Any progress in this program outlined will not only contribute to the understanding of topological groups and algebras, but will also  considerably stimulate research in these areas, and will cause noticeable ""brain drain.""  From the point of view of the effect on the mathematical  community, duality theories often serve as tunnels between two or more otherwise remote areas of mathematics. Thus, dualities have the potential of creating synergy between researchers of distant areas.

"This proposal is to support my research in the area of highly correlated electron systems.  These systems, where traditional theories of electrons in matter break down include high temperature superconductors, heavy fermion and other exotic superductors, as well as various novel magnetic systems.  Of particular interest are systems where superconductivity and magnetism interact, either competing with each other, or supporting each other.



This research begins with synthesizing specimens for study, usually in the form of  high quality single crystals, some of which are grown in our laboratory for the first time.  These specimens are then thoroughly characterized using  various bulk probes and often we iterate the growth process to optimize the  sample quality.  Once sufficiently high quality specimens are obtained, then  I perform various advanced characterization measurements, including muon spin relaxation and neutron scattering and high-field/low-temperature magnetometry. 



Muon spin rotation/relaxation is a uniquely powerful probe of the magnetic properties of condensed matter systems.  This technique is the most sensitive for detecting the small  magnetic fields associated with broken time reversal symmetry which exists in a relatively small number of novel superconductors.  I will be  exploiting this sensitivity to help identify the symmetry of various  exotic superconductors including new oxide and intermetallic superconductors.  Furthermore, measurements of the magnetic penetration depth as a function of temperature and magnetic field provide important information regarding  the symmetry of the superconducting state.  Muons will also continue to play an important role in studying magnetic fluctuations and ground states in numerous magnetic systems.

help foster adoption of new devices and systems, better patient outcomes as well as adaptation and integration

of new technologies/practices into health care and health promotion. CCI funds, most importantly, will enable

us to more adequately release faculty to work on current/new projects and engage with industry partners. It will

also provide for student stipends, the development of a Research Partnerships Portal and the implementation of

our SME Engagement Plan. Local industry will benefit from a suite of Innovation Support Services to help

accelerate the innovation-to-market cycle, including: Innovation Receptor Support Services (Problem/

Opportunity Identification, Faculty/Industry Brokering, Concept Development, Market Research, and Team

Mobilization); Multidisciplinary Collaborative Problem-Solving (multidisciplinary assessment on design and

prototype development, validating usability and testing market potential); and, Innovation-Market Assessment

Services (evaluating usability/market demand and strategic fit with potential investors). Our motivated faculty

and students, various unique facilities, strong industry partnerships and leadership in applied research capacity

"Individual variation in memory ability: Differences between Old- and New-world Lymnaea



The Lukowiak lab developed in 1996 a model system in Lymnaea stagnalis to study the causal mechanisms that underlie long-term memory (LTM) formation. The lab had previously shown that a 3-neuron circuit was both necessary and sufficient to drive aerial respiratory behaviour. We have been successful in attaining our goal of where memory forms at the neuronal level and have gained a partial understanding of how it does so. We now wish to embark on a new line of research using this model system. Put simply, we wish to determine initially at the neuronal level why there is variation in the ability to form LTM between: 1) individuals; 2) inbred vs. out-bred populations; and 3) geographically distinct populations. All of our experiments use lab-bred (i.e. inbred) Lymnaea that were originally derived from wild Dutch snails in the 1950's and maintained since at Vrije Universeit in Amsterdam and at the University of Calgary. These snails, referred to as lab-bred snails, have been cut off from the natural environment for ~ 250 generations. We propose the following questions: 1) Do lab-bred snails have the same cognitive abilities as 'wild' Dutch snails? 2) Is cognition in lab-bred and wild Dutch snails altered by the presence of a sympatric predator (e.g. crayfish)? 3) Will the offspring of wild Dutch snails born in the lab (i.e. F1's) have a similar behavioural phenotype as wild or lab-bred snails? 4) Are the cognitive capacities of Wild Southern-Alberta Lymnaea similar to wild-Dutch snails, to lab-bred snails? 5) Finally, does the presence of the predator that historically has not been sympatric with Wild S-Alberta snails (i.e. crayfish) alter the cognitive abilities of these snails.

"Coldwater disease has a marked deleterious impact on the Freshwater Fisheries Society of British Columbia's production of rainbow trout that are stocked into ~900 lakes across the province. With mortality of some strains approaching 80% the cost to the operation is substantial. Management tools to reduce this impact are required. This project has three major goals; to characterize the strains of Flavobacterium psychrophilum that cause coldwater disease; to understand the immune response to autogenous and to oral vaccination and to determine how triploids differ in their response from diploid fish; and finally to dissect the mechanisms of F. psychrophilum antigen per os uptake using patented technology in order to evaluate experimental oral vaccination for coldwater disease. The results of this project will provide concrete immediately applicable management tools to blunt the effect of coldwater disease for FFSBC and will further the development of management tools for future use.

"These studies are designed to better understand innate resistance of fish to infectious disease and the adaptive response to stress. We are interested in proteins produced as part of the acute phase response. These proteins are produced as a reaction to tissue damage and infection and many of these proteins are responsible for resistance to disease during the period before an adaptive immune response can develop. They act, in part, by binding to the surface of infectious organisms and mediating clearance by phagocytes or by neutralizing tissue-damaging enzymes. To identify these proteins we have used novel, highly sensitive proteomics techniques. We have identified candidate proteins that may be useful as highly sensitive indicators of adverse health in rainbow trout and this research will evaluate their usefulness. We have also used functional binding assays to identify serum proteins that bind to bacterial surfaces. We have identified proteins that may be relevant for resistance to specific bacterial pathogens and this research will address some of the mechanisms by which fish recognize and eliminate infectious agents. We will also examine a novel mechanism of stress-induced immunosuppression. This research may eventually allow the development of assays for selection for disease resistance. Selection for individuals that are inherently resistant to disease will reduce the need for widespread use of antibiotics in farmed fish. Assays of adverse health will also provide objective tools to evaluate husbandry practices on stress and productivity allowing fish farmers to respond effectively to ethical concerns regarding the intensive management of fish.

"The purpose of this proposal is provide immediately usable strategies to reduce the impact of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and at the same time generate novel tools and information in walleye, a highly valuable commercial species in the Great Lakes region. VHSV has long been associated with the European aquaculture industry but wasn't recognized in the freshwaters of North America until the spring of 2005 when a large-scale mortality event in freshwater drum occurred in Lake Ontario. Subsequently the causative virus was shown to be a novel strain of VHSV, unlike other North American or European strains. Mortality events in several species have continued in 2006/07. The discovery of this virus has had an immediate  impact on fisheries management in central Canada. International and domestic regulations put in place to slow the spread

of the virus have adversely affected normal aquaculture operations and practices. Additionally, fish enhancement stocking of walleye have been impeded, as fisheries managers try to stop the spread of virus. The effect of VHSV IVb on these stocked species of fish is not understood. VHSV IVb is also a serious concern to the angling industry with walleye, perch, muskellunge and several other species clinically affected. This proposal addresses some of the needed basic technologies and  knowledge required to manage the effect of VHSV IVb, since the virus is now a fact of life in the Great Lakes. Firstly, alleye-derived cell lines to detect and propagate the virus will be sought. Secondly, infection trials will be done at different temperatures to determine the susceptibility of walleye to VHSV IVb. Managers could exploit this knowledge by basing

stocking decisions on water temperature. This goal might also identify susceptible and resistant strains of walleye for increased survival after stocking. Finally some basic immune parameters of the fish strains will be characterized and correlated with temperature and survival following infection. This will allow managers to make decisions about the use of particular existing strains and the likelihood of stocking success.",Aquaculture,"Agriculture and primary food production",Pathobiology,"Lumsden, John","STPGP ","Veterinary sciences","Animal biology","Biologie animale","2 & 3-3"

"Anthocyanins are naturally occurring flavonoid compounds that impart red to purple colours to skins of dozens of different fruits such as apples, grapes, blueberries, and raspberries. Over 600 different anthocyanins have been identified in plants.  Numerous health benefits for humans have recently been attributed to specific anthocyanin extracts, including anti-cancer properties, treatment of diabetic retinopathy, and benefits towards reduced blood pressure, protection against LDL oxidation, and boosts to the immune system including reduced inflammation. The mechanisms underlying these health benefits are associated with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumour properties. Previous studies have shown that fruits from different plant species preferentially accumulate particular types of anthocyanins, resulting in significantly different bioactive capacities as well as variable pigment intensities and hues.  For example, ""cane"" fruits such as raspberries accumulate anthocyanins derived from a dihydroquercitin precursor that have superior antioxidant properties to those synthesized in commercially important European wine grape varieties, which are predominantly dihydromyricetin-type. While previous work has been devoted to characterizing antioxidant activities of total anthocyanin extracts from cane fruits and grape berries, the molecular biology underlying the production of the apparently healthier proportions of anthocyanin compounds in cane fruit remains unknown.  My lab will: 1) determine the molecular basis for preferential production of dihydroquercitin-type flavonoids in a cane fruit species with reported highest natural antioxidant capacity, black raspberry, in comparison to the important wine grape cultivar, Pinot Noir, and 2) investigate means to metabolically engineer wine grape to increase the production of dihydroquercitin-type flavonoids relative to dihydromyricetin-type flavonoids.  My lab anticipates that this information will be useful in the long-term future for intragenic modification of existing commercial cultivars of grape and other red-berry species for increased health benefits to consumers.

"    )	The most dramatic features of our weather seem to originate in the tropics: the hurricanes, the spectacular monsoon floods or failures, the El Nino events. Accounts in the media suggest that these events are becoming more frequent and more intense. Even worse, we have been warned of the potential failure of the ocean circulation system, resulting in a freeze-up of the northern regions. How much of this is true? What is ""normal""? What has happened in the past? 

    )	In this project, ""Paleoclimate in the Caribbean"", I focus on the warmest parts of the western hemisphere, the region where many hurricanes reach land, the region where the shifting of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone brings variable rains and indirectly controls the monsoons, the region that receives the dust blowing out of the Sahara, the region of the Atlantic Ocean closest to where El Nino Events start, and the region from which the ocean circulation system gets it energy and momentum. This also happens to be a region where it is hard to get terrestrial records of climates of the past and thus the past is not very well known. 

    )	I study the record of climate changes that is stored in layers of cave stalagmites. I want to find out what happened in the Caribbean region over the past 1000 years and then over the past 20,000 years. The stalagmites come from caves in Puerto Rico, Belize, the Bahamas, and other regions. The stalagmites grow as calcite layers whose thickness, crystal form, isotopic composition, and colour change with rainfall, evaporation and dust input. Rainfall amount correlates with position of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, El Nino Events, hurricane activity, sea surface temperature, and even with the oscillations of the northern Atlantic Ocean climate system, while Saharan dust waxes and wanes with drought cycles in the Sahel. What has happened to these cycles in the past? Have they cycled smoothly or changed abruptly? How much have they changed? Has the periodicity changed in the past? Hopefully I am about to unlock all of this information from the layers in those stalagmites.

"IP networks increasingly support a diversity of converged and mission critical network services beyond the original best-effort traffic that they were designed to carry. Rapid deployment of such services coupled with the distributed nature of the IP architecture and protocols have led to a distinct rise in IP network complexity. As a result, troubleshooting network performance issues has become a time-consuming and costly endeavor. Next generation performance monitoring systems will need to examine new types of network data not traditionally utilized for automated troubleshooting systems. This project will focus on exploratory research and prototyping to advance the state of the art in two key areas for next generation monitoring systems. First, the project will focus on developing novel Netflow-based anomaly detection algorithms. Netflow is a network protocol that allows routers to export per-flow traffic statistics summary information to third party network and security

tools for analysis. Second, the project will focus on MPLS network topology discovery and troubleshooting. With the emergence of MPLS, enterprise networks no longer have the visibility into the network cloud of the service provider. Multi-site issue resolution is made more difficult due to the added presence of Layer 2 and Layer 3 MPLS-based VPNs.

"Software complexity has increased dramatically and it still keeps increasing. As a result, the cost of developing and maintaining software systems has also increased significantly. Autonomic computing (AC) is aimed at building systems that have the ability to self-configure, self-manage, self-protect, self-heal, and self-optimize (self-* properties) to reduce human errors, system down time, and improve system efficiency. However, development of autonomic systems is complicated. Model-driven engineering (MDE) applies systematic use of models as primary software artifacts during the development life cycle. High-level models can be transformed into more detailed models and possibly the eventual generation of source code. MDE technologies have the potential to reduce the cost of building and validating autonomic systems. In other words, autonomic systems can be described using various models (e.g., software model, policy model, quality-of-service (QoS) model, and performance model) which can be validated with tools against the requirements and can be utilized at other lifecycle phases. However, it is often difficult to automate or revise the behavioral model. In addition, most existing MDE approaches for AC rely on explicitly known states, which may be impractical for some applications. The main objectives of the proposed research is to (1) extend our existing generative approach to support self-* properties to better understand self-adaptation and its associated cost in performance and QoS; (2) evaluate existing autonomic architectural models and extend architecture analysis methods for autonomic computing; (3) develop decision making strategies to support when, what, and how to adapt in dynamically changing environments; and (4) develop model notations, transformations, and management technologies to facilitate MDE for AC. AC has been advocated to address system complexity which has become a crucial issue in software development and maintenance. The proposed project offer potential solutions to improve MDE technologies for AC which in turn could help to reduce the development and maintenance cost of autonomic systems.

"Summary of Proposal



The overall objective is development of a commercially viable electrochemical process for the production of

ethylene from ethane, having the features:

-Co-generation of ethylene, electrical power and recoverable high-grade heat;

-Stable catalyst activity and anode-electrolyte interface;

-Scalable fuel cell system with stable power density, preferably over 300 mW/cm2;

-Highly selective (>90%) conversion of ethane to ethylene; and

-Virtually no emissions of greenhouse gases.

The basis for the development research project is a new ethane-air proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cell

(""protonic SOFC"") and materials invented at the University of Alberta (patents pending). The technology will

be developed in collaboration with NOVA Research Corporation (""NOVA""). The process is new and uses a

novel doped barium cerate protonic perovskite electrolyte, and a chromium oxide-based composite anode

catalyst, each of which was developed by the proponents with support from NOVA and Alberta Energy

Research Institute. The new fuel cell has several advantages. The system converts ethane extracted from natura

gas very selectively to ethylene with co-generation of electrical power. High grade heat is also recoverable, and

so the proposed fuel cell will attain high overall energy efficiency. The high selectivity of the process ensures

superior hydrocarbon resource utilization. There will be a net overall reduction in wastes and greenhouse gases

when compared with alternative methods for production of ethylene from Canada's hydrocarbon resource and

processing industries. The proposed fuel cell generates virtually no greenhouse gases. The concept has been

demonstrated on the laboratory scale, and now requires development to determine the preferred operating

parameters for efficiency of operation, stability of materials, thin and dense film of electrolyte and the

anode-electrolyte interface, for long cycling life of the fuel cell, in preparation for scale up and demonstration.

"A new fuel cell will be developed that is fueled with syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen

manufactured by reaction of water with a carbon source, and in particular coal which is abundant and cheaper

than other types of hydrocarbon, or coke which is a waste at oil refineries. An innovative feature of the fuel cell

is use of coated Ni foam as the current collector. This material, developed in Canada by INCO, has several

potential advantages. It is strong, light, porous to syngas feed and stable under operating conditions of a high

temperature syngas-air fuel cell. The anode will include the new family of active catalysts exemplified by

La0.7Sr0.3CrO2.85-VOx-YSZ in 40:40:20 ratio (x=1.4-1.6), developed at the University of Alberta. The ionic

conductor will be selected from YSZ and other solid oxide electrolytes compatible with these materials. The

process has several advantages. The system can operate on H2S-containing syngas and thus eliminate the

expensive sulfur removal process. Overall energy efficiency will be very high, as the fuel cell will also generate

recoverable high grade heat. The net result is that the process will attain higher energy efficiency and superior

hydrocarbon resource utilization than is attainable with alternative systems. Consequently, the process will

generate less greenhouse gases per unit of power generated than competing technologies. Development of the

fuel cell based on coated Ni foam will enhance the efficiency of electricity generation and benefit to Canada's

mining and mineral industry from application of nickel in the new market.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","Energy resources","Chemical and Materials Engineering","Luo, Jingli","CRDPJ ","Fuel and energy technology (economic geology, use 4003)","Fuel and energy technology","Combustibles et technologie de l'�nergie",2-3
"The proposed project is directed to providing data on suitable materials and chemistry with immediate applicability in design of SCW. It will generate new knowledge, provide insights on nuclear materials and chemistry, and develop skills of HQP essential to Canada's nuclear industrial capability.  

The Generation (GEN) IV supercritical water reactor (SCWR) is an advanced concept offering advantages compared to light water reactors. However, no current alloy is identified that meets SCWR operational requirements and avoids high temperature corrosion and stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Material performance will need to be demonstrated in the key areas of corrosion and SCC, including identification of appropriate water chemistry that will minimize corrosion rates and SCC. 

The proposed research, in active collaboration with AECL and NRCan, addresses these priorities with the following objectives: (a) identify and improve SCC materials' resistance to corrosion/SCC through surface modification, and (b) quantify effects of oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and hydrogen on SCC to define water chemistries and generate new knowledge/technology to strengthen Canada's nuclear industry, and help fulfill Canada's obligations under the GEN IV International Forum (GIF) agreement.

Susceptibility of candidate materials will be determined under SCW conditions. We will correlate metallurgical factors (compositions and microstructure of the selected alloys) with composition and structure of the corrosion film, and their effect on SCC in SCWRs and mechanisms. The application of surface modification will be explored with the aim of developing a cost-effective technique for Gen IV candidate materials to increase the inherent resistance of the alloys to SCC. SCC susceptibility of the candidate materials will be investigated under a wide range of oxygen and hydrogen concentrations. SCC tests will also be conducted in SCW with different concentrations of H2O2 to mimic the changes in water chemistry that occur due to radiolysis and elucidate mechanism(s). SCC susceptibility of alloys will be studied as a function of the density of SCW.","Materials performance","Construction, urban and rural planning","Chemical and Materials Engineering","Luo, Jingli","NNAPJ ","Materials structure, properties and testing","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",2-3

"In recent years, research on the physical nature of information showed that new possibilities for computation arise when one uses the most fundamental theory of nature - quantum mechanics. Quantum computation is a new area of research concerned with ways to process information by proper encoding into the state of controlled quantum systems. Various types of physical systems are considered for the implementation of the basic unit of a quantum information processor, the quantum bit. Superconducting quantum bits have attracted a lot of attention due to their unique prospects for large-scale quantum computing. These prospects reside in the way in which they are built: superconducting quantum bits are micron-sized superconducting electrical circuits, fabricated using established techniques from microelectronics.



The control of quantum systems, as required in quantum computing, poses tremendous challenges. The state of a quantum system changes irreversibly due to the interaction with its environment, through physical processes termed decoherence. The discovery of quantum error correction showed that the genuine speed-up of quantum computing can be preserved, despite decoherence, by combining two strategies: effective isolation from the environment and adapted quantum control methods. This NSERC Research Tools and Instruments application requests funding for equipment, formed of arbitrary waveform generators and microwave devices, which will be used for research on quantum control methods applied to superconducting quantum bits.



This equipment will be used by two MSc students, one PhD student, and one postdoctoral researcher. These researchers will thus gain expertise in various experimental methods, such as arbitrary waveform generation, microwave pulse shaping techniques, propagation and detection of microwave signals, and computer-controlled experiments.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Physics and Astronomy","Lupascu, Adrian","EQPEQ ","Condensed matterphysics","Condensed matterphysics","Physique de la mati�re condens�e",1-1
"The speed of modern microprocessors relies on miniaturized components, with todays' sizes corresponding to a few hundreds of atoms. Reducing the size even further brings these devices to the limit where genuine quantum effects need to be taken into account. Rather than avoiding such effects, an interesting possibility is to build a computer based on the laws of quantum mechanics. Born towards the end of the 20th century, the field of quantum information processing is an exciting area of research, which brings together physics and computer science. This research sheds as well new light on the foundations of the quantum theory.

The basic unit of a quantum computer is the quantum bit, or qubit. We will explore the potential of qubits based on superconducting circuits with Josephson junctions. Superconducting qubits are realized using techniques developed in the microelectronics industry. This feature implies good prospects for scalability to the number of qubits required for a useful quantum information processor.

This NSERC Discovery proposal is requesting funding for the experimental implementation of those elements that will lead to practical scalable design of a superconducting quantum computer. The first direction of the program is the development of practical tools for controlling and reading-out the state of a few qubits, based on frequency multiplexing. We will use these tools for generation of entangled states and for the study of decoherence in a many-qubit system. In another direction of research we will investigate the potential of microwave photons for quantum computing. 

This project will provide high-quality research training for two graduate students, two postdoctoral fellows, and three undergraduate students. They will gain a strong background in quantum computing and superconductivity, and experience in a whole range of experimental techniques in the area of microfabrication, cryogenics, and microwave measurements.

"This research program aims at the identification and the study of molecular determinants that control the development of the ovarian follicle and oocyte, in relation to follicular selection/dominance and ovulation. The cow is used as the working model since it mimics the physiological pattern of follicular development observed in women, and represents an in vivo model of economic importance. Molecular determinants identified through the application of cDNA subtractive hybridization has allows the establishment of a gene index for granulosa cells at different follicular stages, by comparing non-selected to dominant follicles, and dominant to ovulatory follicles. The expression pattern of genes (known and novel cDNAs) identified, will be investigated by RT-PCR at different stages of follicular development and ovulation. The novel cDNAs identified, will be characterized by cloning and sequencing of their full-length cDNA. The study of the spatio-temporal expression pattern of genes in relation to follicular growth and ovulation will increase our understanding and control of this physiological process: to identify novel genes involved in cellular proliferation and cell signaling (extra and intra cellular) that impact on tissue remodeling, healing, and inflammatory processes; to increase the production of competent oocytes used for in vitro fertilization, nuclear transfer and transgenesis; to increase the efficacy of treatments aiming at follicle synchronization and ovarian super-stimulation programs in domesticated animals of economic importance, and in fertility and contraception programs in humans; and to identify candidate genes associated with fertility that can be used as molecular markers for genetic assisted selection in breeding programs of industries involved in commercializing and distributing male and female gametes.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Biom�decine v�t�rinaire","Lussier, Jacques","RGPIN ","Gene expression","Molecular biology","Biologie mol�culaire",2-5

"In an increasingly connected and globalized world, the notion of security is an imperative, therefore making cryptography a very important research field. In the past two decades, it has been suggested and successfully demonstrated that cryptographic systems that rely on the fundamental laws of quantum physics to ensure the secrecy of transmitted messages offer unprecedented levels of security compared to classical cryptosystems. Research in this field, however, has mainly focused on individual point-to-point links, whose performance in terms of range and user connectivity is inherently limited by the nature of the transmission medium and the implemented protocols. These limitations can be overcome with the advent of quantum cryptography networks. It is therefore now essential to study such networks from both a fundamental and practical point of view, and explore the new capabilities that these networks can offer. 



With this project we push quantum secured networks along three frontiers. The first is the optimization of quantum key distribution networks related to their structure and functionality to reduce the costs of deployment. Further, we develop crytographic protocols making use of the given quantum and classical resources to broaden the use of the hardware installed for these networks. Finally, we work on the framework to proper embed of this emerging technology into existing security structures, including securing proper functionality of the new devices.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Advancement of knowledge","Physics and Astronomy","Lutkenhaus, Norbert","STPGP ","Classical and quantum physics","Theoretical physics and chemistry","Physique et chimie th�oriques",1-3
"Communication is one of the key technologies of modern society. As we turn more and more to electronic communication, questions such as confidentiality of the information exchange and trust in origin of messages come  to the foreground. Today our communication networks are protected by cryptographic methods that seem to be very powerful. However, they depend on assumptions that have to be checked again and again over time. Our research aims at changing this picture.



Quantum mechanics offers some features that are unknown in the classical world: in general, it is not possible to copy quantum signals. Moreover, any attempt to access the content of a quantum message will in general change the message, thereby leaving traces in the system. Thanks to this property, quantum mechanics offers solutions to some problems of our communication society where the asserted properties can be rigorously proven. Unconditional secure communication is one such example. 



Our work aims at transforming more of the known abstract quantum communication solutions to solutions that can be practically implemented, thus bringing it closer to commercial applications.

"Can we detect changes in beta cell mass in vivo? The answer to the question is comprised of three steps: 1) identifying a suitable probe that can selectively target the beta cell; 2) engineering the probe to carry an imaging isotope or contrast agent; and 3) selecting an imaging modality that has the appropriate sensitivity to detect small changes in beta cell number. In order to advance our understanding of the changes in beta cell mass before the onset of diabetes and during the progression of Type 2 diabetes, there is a critical need for imaging probes that can detect beta cells in the living animal. This proposal will focus on the development of novel radiolabelled probes for imaging using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) and PET (positron emission tomography) that can bind to GLP-1 receptors on the beta cell. The long-term outcome of these studies will be the discovery of a probe that can be used to detect changes in beta cell mass in vivo before the onset of diabetes, during the course of the disease and during regenerative therapy. This is of significant clinical value as it would be a predictive tool for changes in beta cell mass including non-invasive evaluation o therapy. This tool would also permit detection of islet transplantation and could follow the progressive decline in function of the islets thereby determining when intervention is required.","Human health (including medically-related psychological research)","Health, education and social services",Chemistry,"Luyt, Leonard","CHRPJ ","Bio-organic chemistry","Organic chemistry","Chimie organique",2-3
"The objective of this research program is to create metal-peptidomimetics capable of exploring biologically relevant chemical space. Using technetium-99m and rhenium tricarbonyl complexes as a scaffold, we will generate novel means of incorporating these metals into biologically relevant molecules in an integrated fashion. This differs from the traditional approach of a conjugate design, where the pendant metal often has a negative impact on the biological affinity of the ligand. One way to create a metal-peptidomimetic is to use these metals as a turn mimetic, replacing the natural turn region of a peptide. In this fashion the metal becomes hidden within the backbone of the peptide. A second approach is to create metal-peptidomimetic libraries, where the technetium or rhenium core is functionalized to create non-peptidic entities. In this manner the metal serves the purpose of arranging organic ligands in a specific and conformationally locked manner. This program desires to shift technetium and rhenium pharmaceuticals from the era of conjugation chemistry to that of being an integral part of a biologically active molecule.

"This research proposal has four main objectives: 1) to investigate the use of recently developed design and analysis of computer experiments methodology for the surrogate modelling of complex environmental/civil engineering models. If successful, this surrogate model will reduce considerably the computing efforts for subsequent uncertainty, sensitivity, and Monte-Carlo analyses of complex computer models; 2) to investigate the possibility of using the response surface methodology techniques in extracting an explicit model from an artificial neural network. The absence of an explicit model associated with the ANNs makes it difficult for the networks to be reproduced and therefore not easily integrated to form coupled models for example. Explicit model extraction from various ANNs ranging in complexity will be investigated. The applicability and limitations of RSM will be comprehensively explored;(3) to investigate the application of structural equation modelling (SEM) for regional flow analysis and environmental modelling.  The rapid progress made in terms of theory and software development warrants a new look at this method that has enjoyed exponential growth in usage in many fields of study. Regional flow analysis data and environmental monitoring data from Newfoundland will be used as case studies. The proposed method will also be compared to currently used methods; and 4) to investigate the application of wavelets analysis methods for daily river flow modelling.  Wavelets has been found to be especially useful for analyzing time series with non-stationary or transitory characteristics such as drifts, trends, abrupt changes, self-similarity, and beginnings and ends of events, much like daily river flow series. This proposal will compare the proposed method with traditional methods. The results of this research will be especially useful to engineers involved in hydrological and environmental modelling. It will provide more efficient tools to tackle the increasing complex problems that engineers face.

"The proposed research investigates the important problems of analyzing, predicting, and influencing the behaviour of nonlinear systems. A system is said nonlinear if its behaviour is described mathematically by nonlinear equations. Most physical systems are nonlinear (e.g., electric machines or chemical reactors) and nonlinear models are necessary to fully capture their complex behaviour.  A common approach to controlling nonlinear systems relies on a mathematically convenient linear model approximation. However, this approximation can lead to lost insight and inefficient model-based control. The field of Nonlinear Control has been developed over the last two decades to directly account for system nonlinearity to control the system without resorting to linear model approximation; the result is real improvement in efficiency and performance. The proposed work develops new theory in Nonlinear Control which will provide mathematically well-founded performance benefits. In many cases, nonlinear systems have a special intrinsic structure which can be naturally exploited in their control. In fact, linear approximations of such models destroy useful structure which could otherwise be used to improve their control. A suitable theory will be developed to detect such structures and then apply appropriate compensation. The derived results have fundamental importance in the field of Nonlinear Control and therefore impact a wide range of controlled processes. The anticipated outcomes can be applied in Canadian industry wherever control systems are used (e.g., motion control in manufacturing or process control in the energy sector).  The theoretical approach is complemented by empirical discovery and the research goals include developing nonlinear theory for specific engineering applications. This approach leads to higher performance in the application and ensures the derived theory has practical relevance. The focus of the applied work is on two test stands under development in the applicant's lab: a self-bearing motor and an autonomous model helicopter. Both applications have potential for commercialization and generating interest from industrial partners.","Mechanical machinery, heavy equipment (including farm, forestry, and construction equipment)","Manufacturing processes and products","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Lynch, Alan","RGPIN ","Control systems","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",3-5
"The main purpose of this study is to investigate the link between productivity and quality of forage on long term organic and transitional dairy farms and how it relates to the fertility of soils on these farms.   Soil fertility is important to support legumes that will supply nitrogen back into the soil while providing for high quality feed. We also want to show that improving soil phosphorus availability and legume biological nitrogen fixation can be achieved without the use of synthetic mineral phosphorus fertilizers. The project is designed to document the sustainability of forage management and soil nutrients under organic management and to provide management strategies for organic producers to maintain their forage and therefore livestock productivity. The specific research objectives are to determine the relationship between forage productivity, quality, botanical composition and legume fixed N and soil fertility status, on organic and transitional farms. In addition, we aim to evaluate and develop strategies to overcome any soil biological or chemical limitations to maintaining forage legume nitrogen fixation. No studies to date in Canada have characterized forage quality and botanical composition under organic dairying and the relationship to farm management and P status of farm components. It is hoped that we will identify options for producers to remain sustainable in this critical aspect of their production system. Our overall goal is to develop innovative strategies for improving forage quality and productivity on organic dairy farms.","Animal production and animal primary products","Agriculture and primary food production","Plant and Animal Sciences","Lynch, Derek","CRDPJ ","Nutrition and metabolism, photosynthesis","Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",3-3

I study the ciliated protozoa, common unicellular microorganisms found in lakes and oceans, in soils and forest litter, and in small ponds. Ciliates feed on bacteria and smaller protists. Ciliates are eaten by larval fish and small crustaceans that may then be eaten by larger fish. Thus, ciliates are trophic links in food webs, and it is important to understand their roles in these ecosystems. One aspect of my research program is experimental ecology. We have built a research facility called the Limnotron in which we will be able to assemble ecosystems of varying complexity, some of them with ciliates and other unicellular organisms. In this way, we can begin to understand their ecological importance in, for example, maintaining ecosystem stability. There may be over 30,000 species of ciliates, but the state of our knowledge of their species diversity and geographic distributions presents a barrier to understanding their ecological role. For example, different species may have very different ecological roles so correct species identification is a critical first step in any ecological study. Thus, a second major goal of my research is to develop molecular methods, such as DNA barcodes, to enable us to operationally assess biodiversity and distribution. An understanding of ciliate diversity leads to a third major goal: construction of both the evolutionary history or phylogeny of the group and establishment of a modern classification. Today phylogenetic analyses use gene sequences, such as ribosomal genes, which are highly conserved across all life forms. Species are related to each other by comparing these gene sequences, which are more similar to each other than the microscopic morphology of ciliates. Ribosomal genes however are not providing us with sufficient information, and so I will use multiple genes to increase the character information and provide more robust conclusions. Since I am the only expert on these organisms in Canada and one of the few in the world, I often collaborate with colleagues around the world to describe new species.

"The long-term goal of this research is to design and develop novel tools and methodologies for effectively modeling, managing, and implementing ""service systems"". The tools and methods will combine existing service delivery platforms, architectures and protocols (web services, service oriented architectures, etc.) and emerging social computing environments such as blogging, wiki's, FaceBook, and virtual worlds.



Service systems are networks comprised of technology, people, and organizations through which services are delivered and deployed. Services are interventions that transform state and co-produce value.  A ""service"" is often defined as any task that one organization or individual beneficially performs for and with another. Examples of service systems include IT outsourcing, education, IT service delivery centers, and call centers. Service systems are highly complex systems (especially if they contain a large variety and number of technologies, people, and organizations) and are difficult to model, manage, and implement because of the complexity of integrating people, their knowledge, activities, and intentions within the systems. 



Through this research, we will create novel tools and methodologies for extracting and building models of complex service systems. We will design and create interconnection methods and tools for integrating existing protocols and technologies with social computing environments to better connect the human and software services in the system, and we will investigate business policy management using knowledge available on the Web and within social networks.

"Our team of investigators conduct basic research in physiology and metabolism. Rodent models are important tools in basic science research.  In particular, there are growing numbers of genetically altered mice or uniquely bred rat models that have become readily available.  Without these models many significant advances in our fundamental understanding of physiology and metabolism would not be possible.  Therefore, the highest level of care and maintenance of these valuable research models is needed.  To meet our research needs, we are in great need of a new and modern cage washer.  This is an essential piece of equipment used in the high throughput cleaning of rodent cages and accessories.  This ensures that animals are provided a clean and healthy habitat.  The current cage washer is nearing its expected life expectancy and safety issues in its operation have been identified.  A modern updated cage washer will address these safety problems and provide a more efficient system for the high throughput cleaning of rodent cages.

"Nanomaterials (size scale: 1-100 nm) with their novel properties unique to matter of such dimensions are offering new ways to address many pressing biomedical issues. Among all the types of nanomaterials, superparamagnetic and semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) are likely to have the greatest impact in biomedicine. Currently, however, it is still a grand challenge to prepare them with very high quality and well suited for use in bio-environments.

  In this context, I have been recently hired by INRS to pursue a vigorous research program in the development of highly functional NPs possessing superparamagnetic and/or luminescent properties and to tailor them towards various important biomedical applications. 

  The short-term objectives of the proposed research program are: (i) to develop hybrid superparamagnetic NPs composed of superparamagnetic metal cores (for the highest magnetization) and robust shells that are able to prevent core-oxidation; (ii) to fabricate luminescent NPs composed of near-infrared-emitting quantum dot (most suitable for in vivo applications) cores and robust shells with sufficient stability and high quantum yields, and (iii) to prepare multifunctional (superparamagnetic and luminescent) NPs that integrate superparamagnetic and semiconductor NPs into one nano-architecture. The main thrust of our activity will focus on advanced nanomaterials design and synthesis, surface modification, structural characterization and the investigation of superparamagnetic and photophysical properties using a combination of experimental techniques. The long-term objectives are increasing our knowledge of superparamagnetic and luminescent nanomaterials as well as pushing them towards biomedical applications.

  This research program will contribute to (i) foster focused research activities in advanced nanomaterials development and characterization, (ii) explore new applications in biomedical sectors, and (iii) train highly qualified personnel to respond to contemporary scientific and technological challenges.

"Fast, efficient isolation of specific phenotypes of cells from heterogeneous mixtures, such as blood, is important in many areas of biological and health sciences. Frequently, the desired cell types, such as Mesnchymal stem cells and circulating tumor cells, are extremely rare, with fractions ranging from 1:105 to 1:1011 compared to the main population. Recent work in microfluidic cell separation has demonstrated size-based separation at low flow rates, but has a tendency to be clogged at higher flow rates. The fundamental limitation of these current mechanisms is their ability to process vast quantities of cells while remaining selective enough to isolate specific rare cell types. The proposed RTI grant will support a research program to separate cells by their mechanical deformability, which prior AFM studies have shown to significantly vary across difference cell types. Using a new approach to actively deform cells in flow, this separation mechanism is capable of processing vast quantities of cells at high flow rates without clogging. Equipment requested by this grant will specifically enable new capabilities in high speed microscopy and imaging, microfabrication via soft lithography, as well as testing and instrumentation of microfluidic devices. By leveraging microfabrication of structures at the size scale of individual cells, with instrumentation techniques to mechanically deform structures with nanometer precision, as well as, precise control of flow in using the tools of multilayer soft lithography, this research program aims to create a 'deformability spectrometer' for cells.

"Fast, efficient isolation of specific phenotypes of cells from heterogeneous mixtures, such as blood and sea water, is important in many areas of biological and health sciences. Frequently, the desired cell types, such as Mesenchymal stem cells and circulating tumor cells, are extremely rare, with fractions ranging from 1:10^5 to 1:10^11 compared to the main population. Traditional cell sorting techniques use a range of physical parameters and chemical interactions to discriminate specific cell types. Physical techniques do not offer sufficient selectivity to isolate rare cells. Chemical techniques are undesirable because the processing steps required may prevent the recovery of cells for further analysis or transplantation into the body. Recent work in label-free cell separations using microfluidics structures has demonstrated size-based separation at low flow rates, but has a tendency to be clogged at higher flow rates. The fundamental limitation of these current mechanisms is their ability to process vast quantities of cells while remaining selective enough to isolate specific rare cell types.

"The proposed research program concentrates on modeling the evolutionary and epidemiological patterns of infectious diseases, with an emphasis on influenza. Influenza is a major cause of human morbidity and mortality. Influenza viruses undergo rapid mutations to evade human immune system. Drastic genetic changes occur from time to time. Influenza pandemics (e.g. in 1918, 1957 and 1968) were caused by these drastic changes. Hence, both influenza pandemic planning and inter-pandemic control have become important public health concerns.



This proposed research aims to estimate important influenza epidemic parameters such as transmission rates, understand the mortality patterns and estimate the influenza mortality burden, estimate the effectiveness of vaccination and antiviral drug usage, understand the interaction between the epidemic process and the evolutionary process. The long-term objective is to develop a mathematically tractable model that can explain the influenza evolutionary and epidemic patterns. These are fundamental questions closely related to the control of pandemic and nonpandemic influenza. The techniques involve compiling pneumonia and influenza related hospital visitation data and influenza serological surveillance data,  fitting the pneumonia and influenza mortality curves to mechanistic models that govern the epidemics, agent-base simulations, and developing new models that combines the epidemic and evolutionary processes. 



While this research is motivated primarily by influenza, it will lead to models suitable for studying control strategies for any fast-evolving pathogens. I will apply the techniques to other infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS.

"The long-term goal of the proposed research is to characterize novel thermostable alcohol dehydrogenases and hydrogenases, and to reveal their roles and potential applications as key enzymes for the production of alcohol and hydrogen as biofuels.  Hyperthermophiles have a remarkable property of growing at temperatures of 90�C and above, and they are capable of metabolizing carbohydrates including various biopolymers and some waste materials to produce ethanol and hydrogen. However, there is very limited knowledge about all the enzymes and their metabolic regulation as well as metabolic pathways involved in the hyperthermophilic production of alcohol and hydrogen.  One of the objectives of the research is to investigate the mechanisms of alcohol and hydrogen production from carbohydrates including glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel manufacture.  The regulation of the production of ethanol and hydrogen will be studied under various growth conditions, and the identification of key enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways will be investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and biochemical analysis as well as molecular probes.  The enzymes will be purified and characterized with respect to their catalytic and biophysical properties using techniques including enzymatic analyses and three-dimensional structural determination.  The optimization of the production of alcohol and hydrogen will be achieved using molecular techniques available for hyperthermophiles.  The microorganisms to be used in this study include representatives from the domains of Bacteria (Thermotoga maritima, Tmax =90�C, and T. petrophila, Tmax =88�C) and Archaea (Thermococcus guaymasensis, Tmax =90�C, and T. kodakarensis KOD1, Tmax =100�C).  Successful completion of this research will provide further information about the hyperthermophilic alcohol and hydrogen metabolism, and elucidate the metabolic pathways at temperatures near 100�C.  Furthermore, the results obtained will provide key information in the construction of alternative and more efficient systems for the production of biofuels alcohol and hydrogen, as well as new information on the evolutionary relationships between hyperthermophilic and mesophilic enzymes.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge",Biology,"Ma, Kesen","RGPIN ",Microbiology,Microbiology,Microbiologie,1-2

"In engineering informatics, interoperability refers to the ability of different engineering software packages to exchange system data. This is a critical requirement for the integration of different application systems that use data from one another; e.g., Engineering Resources Planning (ERP) application uses Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model data; maintenance management applications uses production scheduling data; etc. This interoperability can be described as the interpretability and exchangeability of data types and related information. Interoperability is in high demand due to globalization and value chain integration.

To date, interoperability has only been investigated at the data level. Standards for data format and communication protocols have been developed and adopted by different industries, such as CADCAM applications, in which IGES and ISO STEP standards are used for the exchange of geometric entities. These solutions have obvious limitations on semantics and high-level entity types such as user-defined features and constraints. 

        This research aims to develop a set of generic methods to embed engineering knowledge and achieve interoperability at the feature level in an open collaborative engineering environment. This improvement would allow knowledge rules to be embedded into the constraints of features together with the complex associations of different aspects of a engineering product or project. An open approach is to be taken, which offers self-defining feature types that support flexibility in feature-based information definition, sharing and mapping. The research methodology will be based on object-oriented software engineering and web-service-oriented architecture design. The long-term goal is to reduce system incompatibility in order to support an effective and efficient collaborative engineering management system for multiple players, applications, and stages of engineering lifecycles. Eventually, industry productivity and competitiveness can be enhanced on a significant scale, such as in the use of oil well drilling and refinery modeling.

"The proposed research seeks to evaluate the existing and future potentials for bioenergy production in the Eastern Ontario region.  Bioenergy is the combustion of biomass - in this case, wood - to deliver heat, which in turn can be transformed into electrical power.  Advanced conversion technologies can transform wood biomass to liquid biofuels suitable for use in existing motor vehicles.  If feedstock production is kept within sustainable boundaries, bioenergy is considered to be a renewable energy alternative.    



The project's first objective will be to improve on our current understanding of forest resources in the region by quantifying currently-available wood (biomass) resources, including standing trees as well as harvest and processing residues from existing operations.  The second objective of the work will be to forecast the changing availability of forest biomass under anticipated future climate regimes.  The third objective of the project will be to describe scenarios of bioenergy and/or biofuel development within the region, by identifying prospective sites for facilities and adapting existing economic and environmental models of different technologies to incorporate regional inputs.   These models will be used to fulfill the fourth objective of the study, which is to analyze the potential impact of different bioenergy and/or biofuel technologies on the current and future forest resources of Eastern Ontario, as well as the ability of these technologies to meet regional economic and environmental goals over short, medium, and long-term planning horizons.  



The proposed research will provide a sophisticated analysis of the ability of specific forest resources to support different approaches to bioenergy production, and in turn the ability of these technologies to contribute to political goals at a variety of levels.  This work will also serve as a template for future regional analyses of bioenergy alternatives across Canada.

"Perfluorinated acids (PFCAs and PFOS) are widely disseminated in the global environment and appear at high concentrations in humans and in Arctic mammals.  Precursor fluoro-alcohols are readily found in the atmosphere and have been shown to undergo atmospheric transport and OH driven transformation reactions to yield the perfluorinated acids.  We have developed the 'precursor alcohol atmospheric reaction and transport' or PAART theory to potentially explain these observations.  Residual fluoro-alcohols are significant in fluorinated polymers and may contribute significantly to the global burden, though we know little about the stability of the linkage chemistry within the fluorinated materials.  Human contamination is suggestive of an indirect source of exposure through metabolism of the fluorinated alcohols, which would indicate attention to the reactive intermediates is prudent.  Significant research questions are focused on identifying the dominant routes of human exposure.  One particular hypothesis is that fluorinated surfactants, the fluorinated alkylphosphates, leach from food packaging and are ultimately metabolized to yield the fluorinated acids such as PFOA and PFOS.  Our work will further our understanding on how these materials cause perfluorinated acid pollution and identify the steps to addressing this problem.  We are also actively developing methods in order to identify additional fluorinated chemicals that have been missed used common detection techniques.  The utility of fluorinated materials results in significant societal benefits and a full appreciation for their chemical reactivity and fate will directly contribute to developing materials that deliver the desired qualities with fewer negative consequences.",Environment,Environment,Chemistry,"Mabury, Scott","RGPIN ","Kinetics, reactive intermediaries and mechanisms of reactions","Organic chemistry","Chimie organique",3-3

"As research and development in science and technology continue to improve the lives of Canadians, there is an increasing dependence on computing technology.  As the organization of people, resources and information involved in many activities (ranging from business and manufacturing processes to public health and health services delivery) becomes more complex, and tasks are distributed over various locations, several problems emerge:  (1) how do we generate plans that allow us to organize the people, the resources, and the information, to get the job done in an optimal fashion; (2) how can we develop a system that can take in information, sometimes from several different sources and in several different formats, and adapt or modify the process automatically; (3) how do we ensure that the process as a whole is behaving as we wish - that is, verify, or guarantee, that at all times and under all situations, the process has properties we want and does not display any undesirable properties.  



Workflow technology is designed to provide a reliably repeatable pattern of activity for complex processes, enabled by a systematic organization of resources, defined roles and information flows. Our research focuses on the mathematical foundations of workflow technology that will enable us to find solutions to the above three problems.  We use and develop methods from mathematical logic to automatically generate plans that can be mathematically proved to have properties that we want. Such proofs are especially important in processes or systems where human lives are at stake.  We are working with industry and health authorities to develop prototypes for systems to improve health services delivery.  Interfacing these systems with Canada's emerging electronic health records will provide benefits to all Canadians. In the long term, the results of our research will be applicable to many other economic sectors.

"This research program houses two projects that have different commercial applications and benefits, but are relatively fundamental (i.e., measure common hydrodynamic and transport properties) such that they collectively offer a better overall understanding of transport phenomena in high-pressure multiphase reactors.



1. Synthesis of gas hydrates in a high-pressure slurry bubble column

The synthesis of gas hydrates has been suggested for transportation and storage of natural gas. There is still no commercial process in operation, and since the business has great economic potential, there is very little data on reactor design and performance available in the open literature. The leading patents use slurry reactors and the objective of this project is to characterize such a system in order to obtain the necessary data for design and scale-up. Experiments validating our reactor model and refining the necessary hydrodynamic and transport properties at hydrate-forming conditions will be performed in a recently built world-class high-pressure multiphase fluidization pilot plant.



2. Hydrocracking of bitumen in a high-pressure three-phase fluidized bed

The requirement for large volumes of hydrogen for upgrading bitumen is considered a serious limitation to the Canadian oil sands industry's growth. There is almost no hydrodynamic and transport data available in the open literature that is applicable to the catalytic hydrocracking three-phase fluidized beds used in the bitumen upgrading process. The objective of this project is thus to model these reactors and suggest improvements in their performance via an increase in liquid holdup/residence time and hydrogen transfer/utilization. Dimensional similitude and the high-pressure multiphase fluidization pilot plant will be employed to experimentally simulate the reactor hydrodynamic conditions.

"    )	There are many types of marine animals that live on the ocean floor in shallow coastal areas and rely on particles suspended in the water column as a food source. These bottom, or benthic, animals are important members of the local ecosystem because they filter particles floating in the water column, both living organisms and non-living particles such as sediments. They capture a variety of dilute particles in the water column and convert them into flesh. They in turn are often eaten by others, including man, making some of them important members of food chains and the basis for local fisheries and aquaculture operations. The proposed research looks to provide a better understanding as to which environmental factors, in particular the number and type of suspended food particles, influence the uptake of food energy and conversion to body tissue.  This is important to know because growth rates will determine how quickly individuals are recruited to a  fishery or how rapidly they can be harvested from an aquaculture site. Some of these particles are known to stick together and form larger aggregates or marine snow. These aggregates are very fragile in nature  making them difficult to sample and we really do not know much about their  nutritional value as a food sources or in fact whether most benthic animals can capture or eat them. It has long been thought that these suspended aggregates represent an important link in the flow of energy from the water column to the bottom and on to other levels of the food chains, however there is little experimental evidence to support this.  These particles could represent a major  food supply to the bottom of the ocean and have significant impacts on feeding strategies, growth rates and reproductive cycles of benthic species. The objectives of this proposal will be to assess the characteristics of fragile marine snow in the local Bay of Fundy habitats where I will be studying the ability of local benthic species to capture and eat this little known food source.

"The research program outlined in this proposal entails the development and investigation of several new families of inorganic reagents.  In particular, this research is focused on the chemistry of the main group, which includes the elements of the s- and p-blocks of the periodic table.  Although these elements are components in many important materials (e.g. the semi-conductor gallium arsenide) and chemical compounds (e.g. phosphates), the chemistry of these many of the molecules containing such elements remains poorly understood in comparison to those of organic chemistry or transition metal chemistry. 

     Our studies include both the synthesis of new main group compounds and the accurate modeling of chemical species and reactions through the use of computational chemistry.  The target compounds consist of new classes of chemicals that contain main group elements in unusually low oxidation states and coordination numbers.  Compounds containing atoms in very low oxidation states are electron-rich and are typically highly reactive.  We have found ways to mediate the reactivity of our compounds so that they are stable enough to be isolated yet still possess the desired reactivity characteristics.  Our compounds allow for the convenient synthesis of many compounds that are difficult or impossible to make using traditional methods and we endeavour to use our new reagents to obtain many unprecedented types of chemicals.  We will also explore the utility of our reagents (and chemicals derived from them) as precursors for the formation of new or important materials.  Of particular importance are our investigations of new polymers (plastics) that are composed of phosphorus and other main group elements instead of carbon; these materials will have properties that are much different than conventional plastics.  In addition to their synthetic utility, the compounds studied will provide many new insights into the fundamental aspects of the chemistry of the main group elements.  The understanding provided by such studies form the foundation necessary for the rational design and development of chemicals and materials derived from main group compounds.

"Manufacturing control policies such as Kanban or Constant Work-in-process (CONWIP) are implemented to control the flow of information and materials in manufacturing systems so as to influence the performance of the system. This performance may be measured in terms of average work-in-process inventory, average finished goods inventory carried, cycle time, customer order fill rates, and system throughput. These measures usually conflict - lowering work-in-process inventory (WIP) will negatively impact the system's ability to respond to random demands, and thus have a negative impact on customer fill rates.



We have developed a framework for the analysis and selection of control strategies for manufacturing systems. This framework consists of several elements: the Production Authorization Card System (Buzacott and Shanthikumar, 1992), a unified framework for modeling manufacturing systems; a simulation model capable of simulating complex manufacturing systems operating with this system; neural networks to approximate the simulation expected value functions; and an approach to developing optimal policy curves, a management tool to help identify the best policies in terms of multiple measures of system performance.



In the research proposed here, we want to apply this framework to address some open production problems.  These include the comparison of control policies on large, complex systems with several variants; the study of the impact of using imperfect advance demand information (forecasts) for both push and pull type systems; including priority schemes other than first-in, first-out as policy variables; and studying the impact of batching (lot-sizing).  We also propose to continue the extenstion of the simulation model to incorporate more real world system complexities such as imperfect yield.

"The understory plant community (shrubs and non-woody plants growing under canopy trees) is an important component of forest biodiversity. It provides habitat for a diversity of living organisms and is a driver of ecosystem processes. In forests, canopy trees influence the understory through direct competition and also through effects on environmental conditions important for understory plants (e.g., microsites for establishment, soil pH and nutrient availability, microclimate). Trees can also influence the severity of disturbance by fire, which in turn affects post-fire redevelopment of the understory. On mesic sites in the boreal plain of western Canada forests are dominated by varying combinations of trembling aspen and white spruce. These two tree species differ in their effects on fire severity and on environmental conditions for the understory. Their relative abundance, therefore, has important implications for the composition and biodiversity of understory plant communities in mixedwood landscapes. 

My research is exploring the influence of the presence of white spruce in mixedwood forest landscapes on understory plant community composition and biodiversity. Over the next five years we will: 1) Document the influence of forest composition on fire severity and, in turn, effects on post-fire understory redevelopment; 2) Examine the influence of white spruce on understory plant communities over the long term during post-fire succession; 3) Quantify the effects of the addition of white spruce to aspen-dominated stands on environmental conditions and the understory community; 4) Assess the effects of large, canopy-emergent white spruce on forest environment, white spruce regeneration, and understory communities in mixedwood stands. Three MSc and two PhD students will be trained through this research. The results will contribute to our understanding of factors influencing plant communities in the boreal forest.  Further, this work will help us to understand the potential impacts of forest management practices that manipulate the composition of mixedwood forest, thus providing an important knowledge base for efforts to manage these forests to maintain biodiversity.

"Most of us realize that our blood vessels play an important role in transporting blood to and from all of the tissues of our body.  Blood vessels are, however much more than static tubes for transporting blood.  The structure and function of our blood vessels can adapt to challenges they are presented with and can change their level of function significantly over both short and long time frames.  Two important features of our arteries (blood vessels which transport blood away from the heart) are how flexible they are and how much they can expand when faced with challenges such as increased or decreased activity level.  We have techniques to assess  these two features, stiffness and ability to expand, but we know very little about their regulation.  In my laboratory we have been studying the role that activity, as a technique to change pressure and flow in arteries, plays in altering arterial structure and function.  We now know, for example, that although aerobic exercise may temporarily impair the ability of an artery to expand in response to a challenge, over a longer time frame aerobic exercise training can increase the capacity of the same artery to expand.  We are interested in following up some of our initial studies on exercise training with some studies to determine the precise factors which regulate the short term responses.  We also want to start linking together the factors that regulate the structure and function of the arteries with the local blood flow at the level of the active muscles. To do this we have designed some studies which both increase and decrease local blood flow through exercise and mechanical techniques which mimic exercise.  Objectives of the proposed research program include examination of the impact of alterations in artery structure and function on skeletal muscle blood flow responses both at rest, and acutely following exercise. Our continuing studies will focus on the use of cutting edge ultrasound technology to examine blood vessel stiffness and regional blood flow.  The insight gained from these studies will assist in advancing the current basic knowledge of the cardiovascular system.

"BACKGROUND: Voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channels regulate membrane excitability and action potential re-polarization. In insulin secreting endocrine cells of the pancreas, Kv channels (particularly the Kv2.1 isoform) regulates electrical activity and insulin secretion. Our current understanding of the mechanisms regulating Kv2.1 channel function is limited. Recent evidence suggests a complex regulation by numerous factors including metabolic signals, covalent attachment of regulatory peptides, and interaction with the exocytotic machinery (SNARE proteins). These interactions may prove important in the regulation of Kv channel function, electrical activity and ultimately secretion from endocrine cells.

   OBJECTIVES: We seek to understand the mechanisms regulating voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channel function and interaction with the secretory machinery in endocrine cells. This program has three related aims: to study i) the regulation of Kv channels by metabolic signals; ii) the regulation of Kv channels by covalent peptide modification; and iii) the interaction between Kv channels and exocytotic proteins.

   EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES: Molecular approaches to modulate and modify ion channels; patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate ion channel function and exocytosis; measurements of insulin secretion; 3D deconvolution fluorescence microscopy for co-localization studies and ratiometric Ca2+ imaging.

   NOVELTY AND EXPECTED SIGNIFICANCE: The present work will identify novel mechanisms regulating excitability and secretion in pancreatic endocrine cells, and will characterize several mechanisms regulating the function of Kv2.1 ion channels. Notably, our program seeks to combine our ion channel and exocytosis studies to examine potential novel interactions controlling secretion.

"Testing any software is difficult because of the large number of paths through the code.  To test different paths, the program must be run with a variety of inputs.  Concurrent software makes this already-difficult problem harder by adding non-determinism.  In concurrent software, a program is decomposed into units called threads, which run independently but share data in memory.  Each thread reads and writes shared data, but the order of these operations changes with each run of the program depending on the timing of thread execution.  This non- deterministic order can occur even if the program is run with the same input, and can impact the final results.

     Not long ago, concurrent software was rare.  It has become more mainstream recently and will only increase in importance in the future.  Hyperthreaded and multicore CPUs create environments in which concurrent programs can achieve performance benefits by using different parts of a CPU simultaneously.  Getting full performance from these new environments will require programmers to write concurrent code.

     My approach to the problem of testing concurrent software is to execute a concurrent program deterministically - that is, run the program where the order of events is determined in advance.  My approach, which forms the basis of this research proposal, uses advanced compiler analysis techniques to identify places in a concurrent program where thread timing can impact values for read events.  This analysis is then used to control program execution by supplying values to read events that simulate the desired event order.

     Testing and debugging are crucial parts of the software development process.  Quite simply, software errors cost real money.  As concurrent code becomes increasingly important, it is essential that testing and debugging tools keep pace.  Otherwise, software with new classes of errors that are difficult to detect and correct will reach consumers.  For example, after Intel announced hyperthreading, several commercial programs emerged to exploit the potential benefits, including Adobe Photoshop and Symantec Anti-Virus.  My goal is to improve software quality by helping developers produce correct applications in the important concurrent domain.

"Canadian society faces an urgent need for improved building systems in light of climate change and environmental degradation. The applicant will investigate natural fibres as a modern construction material. ""Natural fibres"" are cellulosic fibres obtained from plant sources, including wood, straw, hemp, and flax.

Natural fibres have a number of environmental benefits. First, natural fibres are a renewable resource. Canada, with its large land base, is capable of producing millions of tonnes of cellulosic fibres every year. Natural fibres used for insulation can replace glass-fibre batts or foam insulation produced  from non-renewable materials. Second, plants remove CO2 (the main green-house gas leading to climate change) from the environment and use it to produce cellulose. When plant material is incorporated in a building element, this captured CO2 remains locked up for at least the design life of the component. 

A burgeoning industry in Canada, the United States, and Europe is developing new structural components that incorporate natural fibres. One form uses waste straw bales stacked up and plastered on both sides to form load-bearing walls or cladding in a timber or steel frame. Currently, these systems are used in a limited number of buildings. Engineers are often reluctant to use these components because there is little validated information on how these systems behave structurally.

The applicant will address these needs by conducting full-scale structural testing and modeling on natural fibre structural insulated panels. The applicant will investigate improved systems that address durability concerns (such as prefabricated straw bale panels), the application of natural fibres to structures such as barns, warehouses, and sheds, and then use of other natural fibres, such as hemp. The applicant will use sophisticated modeling techniques, such as finite element analysis, to understand how these systems respond to applied loads, and an innovative digital imaging technique, called Particle Image Velocimetry, that allow investigators to measure deformations at any point within a panel with high accuracy.

"This 5-year project explores the complexities of  trace fossil assemblages that are preserved in ancient deposits of deltas.  The study of trace fossils is referred to as ""Ichnology"". 

The deltaic intervals selected for study show either a mixture of river and wave influences, or a mixture of river and tide influences preserved in the structures of the rocks. It is hypothesized that these intermediate delta types (as opposed to river-, wave-, or tide-dominated expressions) possess unique trace fossil characteristics. Such characteristics include trace fossil diversity, burrowing intensity, types of interpreted animal behaviours, uniformity of burrow distribution, and size ranges of the biogenic structures. 

The case studies chosen for this project will be compared to previously assessed successions that reflect end-member states.  The integration of the physical sedimentary features with the observed trace fossil characteristics will enhance our ability to identify similar deposits elsewhere, and will provide a continuum of delta types to assist in the development of more broadly applicable depositional models. Additional case studies will explore the concept of delta asymmetry; a situation where mixed river-wave influenced deltas may be characterized by preferential river deposition on the downdrift side of the delta lobe. Asymmetric deltas yield unique successions and have, historically, been difficult to identify in the rock record.  The case studies evaluated in this project will attempt to erect criteria to enhance our ability to recognize these complex successions.

Circuits will be devised to tune and correct non-ideal and unwanted circuit behaviour that is characteristic of the current and up-coming generations of nano-scale integrated circuit technologies. The research results will lead to increased energy efficiencies in integrated circuits, enhanced performance in the areas of operating speed, increased dynamic range, and low voltage operation.

"When materials are combined, not through formation of a compound, but instead into a heterostructure (in the simplest instance, a thin film of one material on a substrate of another) the resulting properties may differ substantially from those of each of the pure bulk starting materials. Such ""metamaterials"" have important applications in electronics and sensors, and newly developed metamaterials can have unprecedented properties which may form the basis of entirely new technologies, such as quantum computers or spintronics. In a similar way, the properties of materials differ at a free surface, for example, in surface reconstruction, the crystal structure of atoms at the surface is different from that of a simple truncation of the bulk. Such effects can (and generally do) propagate below the surface. Thus, the properties of metamaterials and crystals near a free surface are depth dependent. Remarkably little is known about such phenomena, mainly because very few depth-resolved techniques are available. This proposal aims to use the technique of low energy beta detected nuclear magnetic resonance at TRIUMF, Canada's National Lab for Particle and Nuclear Physics, as a new depth-resolved (at the nanometer scale, i.e. one billionth of a meter) experimental probe of solid materials, addressing fundamental and practical questions in, for example, magnetism and superconductivity in nanoscopically structured metamaterials. The diffusive motion of ions in solids is another practically important property (for instance in solid state electrochemical batteries) that is modified (and depth-dependent) in the vicinity of an interface or free surface. The proposal also aims to study diffusion of the isolated probe ions in this context.

"The proposed research involves the design of efficient algorithms, or a demonstration that no such algorithm is likely to exist, for certain combinatorial problems.  As much of the research program as possible is to be carried out in such a way that opportunities are provided for undergraduate students, Master's students, Ph.D. students, post-doctoral fellows, and young colleagues.  There are three main topics involved: homomorphisms of graphs, discrete-time graph processes, and domination in graphs.  The first of these has applications in computer science, scheduling, and logic.  The second topic involves, among other things, a very simple yet computational difficult model of the spread of a virus or disease through a network or population.  The final topic is arguably among the most well-studied in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science.  Besides being interesting for its own sake, it has proved to be an excellent vehicle for involving students in research.

"The ""Transformable 3D Interactive Devices for Virtual Environments (VE)"" research program builds upon the previous NSERC Discovery Grant held by C. MacGregor. A significant outcome of that research was the design of a shape-changing input device (veBall, under patent review) for working in 3D space (e.g. VEs, 3D modelling and design). When veBall is in the form of a truncated sphere, the user can perform basic translation movements (e.g. panning and zooming). When the shape is changed to a full sphere, the user can rotate the virtual object in 3D space. This approach improves task performance and task usability as the change in shape allows for more natural grips and physical movements that map closely to what is happening on a screen. In addition, the veBall can be used for two-handed operation as an input device.  For example, when designing a 3D model the veBall can be used by one hand to rotate the model while the other hand uses a stylus or mouse to change the colour of selected components within the model. Since haptic feedback has been found to help in bimanual tasks we will explore creative solutions for including mechanisms for producing haptic feedback (i.e. providing a sense of touch or physical contact with a virtual object). To include this feedback in shape-changing devices, we will explore the following: depending on the task and shape, should we provide the user with a steady pulse or a series of vibrations; and how frequent should these signals be? Currently the most commonly used haptic devices range in cost from $2,000 to over $84,000 CDN. Our long term goal is to develop a set of low-cost (under $200 CDN) transformable interactive devices that can be used to facilitate 3D engineering and design activities; and to enhance spatial awareness and navigation in VEs used for training (e.g. search-and-rescue scenarios for emergency personnel; training children to develop spatial skills; and rehabilitation programs to help individuals regain use of hands and upper limbs). HQP will have opportunities to develop highly specialized skills in the areas of haptics, VEs and 3D simulations, along with usability design techniques important to industry for the design, development, and evaluation of consumer-based products.","Information, computer and communication technologies","Advancement of knowledge","Systems Design Engineering","MacGregor, Carolyn","RGPIN ","Virtual reality and related simulations","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",3-5

"This research program consists of two main thrusts within an overall context of data networking. The first is the invention and exploration of new algorithms to be used by the routers, firewalls, etc. internal to the network. The second is the development of models and controls for these devices based on knowledge of their system-level organization.



Algorithms

Most of the tasks performed by routers, switches and other network devices can be gathered under the title of ""classification"". For example, the main purpose of a router is to direct traffic towards its destination. The algorithms component of this program consists of the exploration of the effects and implications of approximation and imprecision in classification. Approximation and imprecision are desirable degrees of freedom in the design of many types of algorithms. In my view their application to classification has so far only been flirted with.



Architectures

One of the fundamental difficulties in conducting research in data networking is that both the hardware platforms (routers, switches, etc.) and their operating systems (Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, etc.) are closed, proprietary artifacts. Commodity, off-the-shelf (COTS) computers and switches can be combined with public domain software to create open systems for routing and switching. However the performance of the resulting systems is difficult to anticipate and to control. The architectures component of this program will consist of the modeling of COTS network devices based on black-box models of the individual components. These models will be used to derive effective control techniques for these devices, and tested in a prototype system.

"""Diagenesis"" comprises all mineralogical, physical, and chemical changes that happen to  sedimentary deposits from the time of deposition at the Earth's surface to burial at depths of about 6 - 9 km and commensurate temperatures of about 200 oC. Diagenesis is of supreme importance for human civilization. Because of the changes in porosity and permeability, diagenesis affects the ability of the rocks to carry or store groundwater (used for human consumption and irrigation in relatively shallow settings), oil and gas (commonly in deeper settings), and certain metal ores (shallow or deep settings). 

    )	

This research program deals with all types of diagenesis in carbonate rocks, which are either limestones (calcium carbonate) or dolostones (calcium-magnesium carbonate). It is an extension of earlier work and will focus on Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of western Canada, where such rocks contain very large accumulations of oil and gas. Rocks of similar age (more than 300 million years old) in Germany and Spain, as well as of younger age in Texas and the Caribbean, will also be studied for comparison. Samples will be taken from cores at a range of depths in active oil and gas fields, and from outcrops in rocks of comparable ages or types. Methods include mapping, rock descriptions from hand specimens and microscopy, and a variety of geochemical techniques, such as trace element and isotope analyses. For each case study, a chronological sequence of diagenetic events will be established. Integration of the various case studies aims at establishing regional diagenetic patterns in western Canada and prediction of diagenetic patterns elsewhere. Ultimately this research program will aid in exploration for hydrocarbon resources, and will help to maximize extraction from producing oil and gas fields.

"Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and especially Doppler OCT (DOCT) are new technologies that raise much interest and just begin to reveal their full potential. OCT provides depth-resolved three-dimensional and (quasi-)real-time  imaging of living tissue and other semi-transparent samples in a non-invasive way using low-coherence interferometry. DOCT provides high resolution and high dynamic range measurements of fluid velocities in a variety of geometries relevant to microfluidics and vascular conditions such as stenoses and branching arteries. 



The proposed research program will capitalize on previous work done in this area at the Biophotonics Laboratory at Ecole Polytechnique. It will introduce several improvements in the existing system in terms of higher resolution (approaching 1 �m) and wider dynamic range (circa 80 dB), a faster response (a few images per second) and vectorial velocity maps of fluid flow thus opening the door to a) high resolution fluid dynamic studies in labs-on-a-chip by monitoring microflows in cell cultures and b) flow and wall shear stress studies in arterial phantoms, a topic of prime importance for the assessment of the effect of flow on plaque formation in atherosclerosis. 



Improvements will cover: a) more efficient hardware; b) faster data acquisition methods; c) better data processing approaches; d) display interfaces; e) multimodality; f) efficient and precise vectorial maps of velocities. 



Coupled with other imaging modalities (fluorescence, confocal, two-photon) on a single platform, Doppler OCT could become a truly powerful diagnostics tool with unprecedented resolution and functionality.

"It is my goal to better understand the fundamental properties of muscles.  Active force has been calculated by: peak force - passive force measured at the whole muscle length.  We showed that passive force can decrease during a contraction and that active force could be correctly calculated if fiber bundle length is measured using sonomicrography: ultrasound is emitted from a crystal implanted at one end of the fiber bundle and detected by a crystal at the other end.  I will investigate properties of muscle that may have previously been misinterpreted due to active force miscalculation.  The anesthetized rat medial gastrocnemius muscle will be tested in situ.  Individual motor units (defined as any motor neuron and all muscle fibers it innervates) will be activated alone, or in combination with another one with different sized motor units, and at several lengths.  Passive force is greater at long lengths, so the miscalculation is greater.  I believe the corrected method will give force of two motor units activated together similar to the sum of the two activated separately.  There are several reports that lengthening contractions cause the relationship between length and active force to shift to the right.  It has been suggested that the shift to longer lengths is caused by increased compliance, but this has not been directly assessed.  I will measure compliance, using sonomicrography, and cause damage in muscle, by lengthening contractions or needle piercing and compare the contractile response (including compliance).  It is hypothesized that a shift to the right will only be seen when passive force decreases due to the treatment, and active force is calculated in the traditional manner.  The rightward shift will not be evident with the corrected method of calculating active force.  Muscle responds to increased or decreased use by changing protein synthesis.  It is thought that cell signalling mechanisms are sensitive to the force in the muscle, resulting in activation of some key signalling molecules.  I propose to measure these, to see if active force, calculated in the correct way is a more sensitive predictor of this than the traditional method.  The work that is proposed will advance our fundamental understanding of how muscles function.

"Modern society benefits from the use of a large number of chemicals including petroleum and petroleum by-products, solvents, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and fire retardants. Most are relatively innocuous and pose no threat to the health of humans or the environment on which we depend. Some, however, are problematic in that they may persist for long periods of time (e.g. PCBs), they may accumulate in organisms such as fish and birds (e.g. DDT), they may be very toxic (e.g. dioxins) and they may be transported long distances to polar regions (e.g., HCB). Rather than wait for problems to emerge (by which time it may be too late!) it is preferable to be proactive and identify problem chemicals before they contaminate the environment and cause adverse effects. The best way to accomplish this is to use mathematical models to predict how these chemicals will behave in the environment and what risk they may pose to the ecosystem.



The purpose of this research project is to develop such models, test them to ensure reliability by comparing their predictions against actual observations, and to disseminate them to the user-community. This has been and continues to be the focus of the Canadian Environmental Modelling Centre at Trent University. The Centre currently disseminates models via the internet at a rate of about 500 per month to nearly 40 countries.



More specifically, this project will focus on four areas. The first is chemical fate in regional environments (e.g. a Canadian province) including soils, water, sediments, and air, and exposure and risks to flora, and fauna including humans. Second is the fate of pesticides that may cause contamination of food and off-site locations. Third is indoor environments which are important because much time is spent indoors under conditions of restricted ventilation. Finally are models that will assess if a chemical is likely to be transported long distances, especially to the Canadian Arctic.

"Wood properties result from a genetically encoded program of development, known as secondary vascular growth or wood formation. Wood formation is a complex process because it is influenced by variations in environmental conditions over the growth season and the life of a tree. Gene expression is one of the mechanisms by which trees integrate genetic information and environmental cues in order to make wood. My program aims to identify and explore molecular links between genotypic variation and wood properties, through the study of genome-wide gene expression. The goal of my research is thus to provide insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits like wood. The transcriptome is comprised of the entire set of RNA transcripts present in a cell or tissue and represents the genes that may be expressed. We will use new microarrays to survey the expression of nearly all the genes present in the genomes of trees. The different subprojects will also rely on quantitative PCR and other methods to investigate the modulation and regulation of RNAs pools. Specific objectives are to (1) Develop reference profiles for conifer trees, comprised of diverse views of the dynamic transcriptome and provide a reference framework for our research and that of others; (2) Delineate the transcriptome modules that are linked to the processes underlying wood formation, as a function of daily and  seasonal variation, spatial position in the tree and of environmental factors like drought; (3) Investigate the variability and genetic control of transcript abundance at the population level as a means to gain insights into the genetic architecture underlying complex traits; (4) Study mechanisms and networks underlying transcriptome regulation during wood formation in trees, through gain-of-function experiments with selected regulatory genes. The research will support the training of Ph. D. and M. Sc students. It will also result in applications in forestry, namely through the development of molecular breeding of forest trees.

"Most high volume modern manufacturers adopt a quality system such as ISO 9001 or ISO/TS 16949. Users of these systems are required to control their processes by measuring critical inputs and key characteristics of the products. There are many measurement systems and large numbers of measurements routinely taken.



Given the importance attached to measurement, a general requirement of these quality systems is that the manufacturer periodically assess the measurement systems to ensure that they are operating as expected.



The major goal of this research is to look at ways to improve the assessment methodology in this context.  Such improvements can save the manufacturer time and money and hence have a positive impact.



The measurements come in a variety of forms: continuous values such as dimensions and positions (two or three dimensional), discrete counts such as the number of defects, binary responses (product is acceptable or not) and functional (a response curve to a varying input signal). Many systems simultaneously measure several characteristics, often of different forms.  The assessment plans and analysis of the data collected are dependent on the complexity of the system and the forms of the measurement.



Current methodology for the assessment of measurement systems does not make use of  known statistical characteristics of the manufacturing process or the large number of products that have a known measured value. We plan to exploit this information and adapt the current methodology to achieve improvements for the different forms of measurements.

"My NSERC Discovery research program examines planning and control of human hand movements. Goal-directed hand movements are fundamental, essential for effective human communication, manipulation, tool use, and interactions in daily life. This point is made clear for those with temporary or permanent loss of hand function due to neurological or musculoskeletal injuries or disease.  As tools and technologies evolve, the importance of the human hand and brain for computer-based interaction and manipulation is magnified. My research investigates also the underlying information processing for such computer-mediated interaction tasks, from a human-centred perspective. 



     Controlled experiments are conducted to better understand the central representations for the planning and control of prehension. We measure reaction time, movement time and 3D kinematics in complex manipulation tasks, with and without tools, in natural, virtual and augmented environments, using the Virtual Hand Laboratory (former NSERC Strategic Project). This involves high precision tracking of 3D motion for real-time computer-generated graphic, haptic and audio displays during human interaction and manipulation.



      This interdisciplinary research contributes to the training of highly qualified personnel (HQP) for Canadian industry and academia. There are significant implications and applications for human-computer interaction, goal-directed human activities, and the design of complex human-machine systems.  These provide continued economic benefits to Canada.

"Quantum mechanics governs essentially all phenomena at microscopic scales and below. I intend to examine several problems in quantum mechanics and its more sophisticated relative, quantum field theory.

Two of these problems are in the context of solitons, which are extended solutions of classical field theory which resemble particles in their behaviour. While not intrinsically quantum mechanical, these objects exist in quantum field theory as well.

Another research project pertains to the Josephson effect in superconductivity from a field theory perspective, as well as a generalization of this effect to situations where the underlying symmetry is of a type known as non-abelian.

An important property of the strong interaction which holds nuclei together is confinement, the fact that certain fundamental particles (quarks and gluons) cannot be isolated from one another. This property is as widely accepted as it is difficult to actually prove. Two projects on which I am working study toy models which may or may not have this property; what is learned from the toy models will hopefully shed light on more realistic models.

Anoher research effort represents a bit of a change of direction for me, towards quantum information, a new and vigourous field of research. One specific problem I am investigating is the conditions of validity of the so-called adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics. This theorem has been known since the early days of quantum mechanics, yet the exact conditions under which it is valid have come under scrutiny lately. Secondly, I am studying the simulation of generalized quantum measurements on an entangled quantum system using classical communication, which is a subject of great interest in quantum information and quantum communication.

"A program of research is proposed that will focus on ""motor and perceptual optimization of user interfaces"".  User interfaces are broadly interpreted as any computing device used by humans, for example, conventional desktop or tabletop systems, notebook or laptop systems, tablet systems, mobile devices, or PDAs,  The motor and perceptual aspects of the research pertain to the human output (motor) and input (perceptual) channels that are engaged as humans interact with computing technology. Optimization is a reference to the use of empirical research methods to test alternative interfaces.  Design options are tested and compared in user studies, with better performing options advancing for further optimizing and testing, and poorer performing options discarded.

     The human side will research the use of hands, arms, fingers, and even the movement of head and eyes. (Speech input to computers is not part of this program of research.) There is considerable on going research in the way users interact with computing devices with their hands and fingers, and this will continue.  The PI will research touch-based mobile devices that support a variety of touch gestures (e.g., flicks) as well as multi-touch interaction (e.g., for zooming in and out).  Auditory and tactile feedback will be researched as a means to optimize interaction and to reduce the visual load.  The latter is important for mobile devices since they are typically used in dual-task settings where the primary task (e.g., walking or driving) requires the use of the eyes.

"This is an application for three years of support to allow me to pursue and hopefully complete some very promising work now in progress in two areas which NSERC supported during the past 5 years. 

   (a) Jellyfish are members of the Cnidaria, the most primitive extant animals to have a nervous system. I am interested in how their nervous systems are organized at all levels from behaviour in the sea down to the membrane channels involved in production of nerve impulses and the mechanisms involved in communication between individual nerve cells. This helps us understand how the first nervous systems evolved. I recently found a new inhibitory pathway in jellyfish which has the potential to clarify important questions concerning inhibitory synaptic transmission in these animals, an area about which very little is currently known. My proposal is to investigate the process further at the cellular and membrane levels and to analyse the mechanisms involved.

   (b)  ""Sea squirts"" (Ascidiacea) are common intertidal animals and (unlike jellyfish) are available all the year round. They are members of the Tunicata, a group now widely regarded as the sister group of the vertebrates, both having evolved from a common chordate ancestor. Comparing the nervous systems of sea squirts and vertebrates has already brought to light many fundamental similarities in the way their nervous systems develop and my own work with Italian colleagues has helped clarify the origins of the acoustico-lateralis system, from which our own organs of hearing and balance evolved. The particular questions I  plan to address centre around the production of new nerve cells as the animal grows. It is clear that  large numbers of new nerve cells are produced in adult sea squirts but there is no definite  evidence about where they come from. I have perfected a procedure for identifying one type of nerve cell in all stages of its production and will investigate the locations where this occurs, and the seasonal timing of the process.

"The development of new nanocomposite materials is critical for future applications.  Already composite materials are widely used in applications spanning tennis rackets to jets, and it is likely that they will be used for many emerging applications where high strength and minimum weight are important.  In addition, nanocomposite materials may be precursors to highly porous materials that could be used for gas separation and storage applications.



This project involves a collaboration between researchers at the University of British Columbia and scientists at FPInnovation (Paprican Division) to develop new organic-inorganic hybrid materials.  Cellulose nanocrystals extracted from wood fibre will be used to generate new types of nanocomposite materials that are anticipated to have useful mechanical properties (strength, fracture toughness) and, after template removal, are expected to be highly porous in nature.

These compounds have chemical structures which make them able to mimic fish hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone. When fish are exposed to the endocrine disruptors, their normal hormone systems are altered. This can result in effects such as smaller ovaries and testes, ""intersex"" (in which both ovary and testis tissue are in one gonad), lower blood levels of reproductive hormones and changes in the numbers of offspring produced. Our project is focused on understanding how endocrine disruptors released into Canada's coastal environments interfere with normal functioning of fish reproductive systems. We will study how a common east coast saltwater minnow, the mummichog (Fundulus

heteroclitus) is affected by endocrine disruptors in pulp mill effluents and sewage. We know much less about effects of endocrine disruptors in marine environments compared to freshwater systems. Because coastal environments have changes in water salinity, temperature and oxygen on a daily basis, we will first focus on understanding how changes in these variables, combined with the presence of endocrine disruptors, affect how fish are exposed to the chemical disruptors and how the fish's reproductive biology is changed. We will then design a standardized laboratory test using mummichog which can determine how potent certain effluents are in causing reproductive changes. This test can be used to determine the effectiveness, for example, of process changes made by industry to improve effluent quality. The test can be used by other research groups,

government agencies, industries and consulting companies to test the quality of effluents. We will work with government regulators, industries, municipalities and citizen groups to ensure that our test meets regulatory needs and will be effective for effluent testing.

We therefore do our studies using a common east coast saltwater minnow, the mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus).  Working in the lab, we expose different life stages of the fish to estrogens and androgens, as well as estrogen and androgen antagonists (block rather than mimic the natural hormones).  We then determine at what life stages (e.g., developing embryos/larvae, juveniles, reproductive adults) the effects occur.  When we understand what life stages are being affected, we then investigate the biochemical mechanisms by which the contaminants have their effects.  We are primarily interested in the effect that the endocrine disruptors have on normal functioning of the ovary and testis in developing fish and in reproductive adults.  By determining the mechanisms by which endocrine disruptors work, we hope to be able to develop fish bioassays which will be able to assess the potential of industrial and municipal effluents to cause reproductive effects in fish.  The long-term goal is to understand mechanisms of endocrine disruptor effects in wild fish, and therefore to find ways to protect our coastal environments.

"The research described in this proposal concerns the synthesis of novel heterocyclic structures that will ultimately be used for the development of new polymer materials.  Electropolymerizable structures involving bithiazole and biimidazole cores will be used for the synthesis of polymerizable metal complexes.  The helical arrangement of organic molecules around the metal center in these complexes will endow them with interesting optical, catalytic, and sensory properties.  The untapped potential for these structures to act as ""chiral catalysts"" in electrochemical hydrogenation experiments is something that needs to be explored.

    )	The proposal is divided into two sections: the synthesis of heterocyclic molecules for subsequent complexation with metal centers, and the synthesis and electrochemical investigations of metal (ruthenium and rhodium) monomer and polymer complexes.  Some of the heterocyclic structures proposed in the first section will possess imidazole moieties.  Reports of imidazole-containing electroactive polymers are not common.  Still, the imidazole systems of this work should demonstrate useful features that other, more popular systems do not.  For example, they should be able to be chemically altered (protonated/deprotonated or functionalized), either prior to or following complexation to metal centers.  This feature should permit some degree of tunability over their chemical properties.  The potential for the metallopolymer materials of the proposed work to influence asymmetric transformations would be of immense interest to pharmaceutical and synthetic companies.  Studies aimed at understanding their electron and ion transport processes in chiral environments are also of interest, for their application to sensory technologies. 

    )	The work, which will be carried out in our lab by undergraduate and graduate students, will provide invaluable training for scientific careers, covering an unusually broad group of techniques.

"We propose to establish a collaborative research partnership with the forest industry of Nova Scotia (NS) and

the NS Department of Natural Resources, with the specific goal to develop an advanced growth and yield (G&Y)model. The modelling framework envisioned will incorporate state-of-the-art technology to relate forest G&Y to biophysical conditions and site quality that control growth, species-response functions, and forest-stand dynamics under new silvicultural interventions. The model will be designed to provide stand and tree information required for provincial wood supply analyses and be the basis for future sustainable forest management planning in NS and elsewhere.



Currently, forest management planning uses G&Y estimates derived from sampling plots placed throughout the forest. These G&Y values generally reflect average conditions in individual strata classified according to

species composition and management history. Such G&Y values are normally acceptable when applied to even-aged stands treated with a single management regime, but not to inceasingly used uneven-aged management prescriptions. We will develop a robust, design-based empirical tree model that will incorporate process-based data. Forest industry in NS will directly benefit from this research by having a scientifically-defensible G&Y prediction protocol. Training of partners in model calibration and use will take place. The G&Y model envisioned here will be sufficiently general in its structure and content that it can be transferred to other jurisdictions in Canada, and elsewhere. The NS G&Y model has potential to be used to address questions of national importance including impacts of climate change on stand and landscape development processes, species replacement, and ecosystem integrity and use of forests for carbon sequestration under constraints of wood utilization and forest management.

"At least part of Canada's forest will sustain intensification of forest management over the next decades. A criticism is that planted stands are 'sanitized', with less structural diversity, fewer species, and removal of downed and standing deadwood. Concerns are typically focused on paucity of deadwood and reduced species diversity in the overstory. This research will determine the influence of key habitat structures, early in the rotation of planted stands, on animal and plant taxa and thereby on key ecosystem processes, and how these can be incorporated into management strategy. We are focusing on taxa that have a clear connection to deadwood and thinning response - namely invertebrates, bryophytes, and bird species that are directly dependent upon deadwood, ground vegetation species sensitive to disturbance, and small mammal species that have been observed to have low density in planted stands. We will experimentally manipulate habitat structure elements

in spruce plantations, and determine influence and effects of landscape context around sample plantations on the selected taxa. Specific research objectives are to: 1) determine the rate of response of saproxylic (wood inhabiting) invertebrates to management; 2) test effects of three potentially limiting factors on distribution of understory plants - dead wood availability, microclimate conditions, and propagule availability and/or early establishment; 3) evaluate causes of low abundance of red-backed voles, whether change in food supply or ground and below-ground microclimatic conditions; and 4) test predictions that bird assemblages will respond to post-treatment increases in woody debris and to landscape context, and that use of girdled trees by birds will be higher in landscapes with a greater proportion of naturally-regenerated forest. The project will support 8 Masters and PhD students at University of New Brunswick and Universit� de Moncton. Given the direct

involvement of company managers in all phases of the study, results will be speedily incorporated into management practices.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Forestry and Environmental Management, Faculty of","MacLean, David","CRDPJ ","Evolution and ecology","Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",1-5

"Pervasive access to networked information can bring connectedness, efficiency and enjoyment into our lives while we listen to podcasts, skype with collaborators and check messages. Too often, however, people experience digitally enabled interactions with other people, technology and data as an irritating series of asynchronous interrupts, frequently requiring explicit attention to manage. The resulting attention overload, information loss and corruption of social cues can lead to a wide variety of highly negative consequences - social, personal and economic. This project targets the challenges of excessive sensory / cognitive load and loss of social cues resulting from inadequacies in today's interfaces to networked information and communications. Our main goal is to offload some of the user's explicit interactions with these systems to an implicit sub-attentional level, thereby making the interactions more transparent and allowing the user to focus on his/her primary task. The core innovation is the Haptic-Affect Loop (HALO): we will utilize the sensed affect response of the user (psycho-physiological reaction to a current environment or situation) to trigger changes in the interaction, while providing immediate, unintrusive feedback to the user about the change through the tactile channel of the haptic sense. Our core objectives are: (1) to implement and model the HALO, refining current affect sensing and tactile technology and prototyping the core interaction in an abstracted setting; and (2) to validate HALO through user evaluation in two real use contexts - navigation of streaming media (e.g. podcasts), and background communication in distributed meetings - which exhibit key interface challenges observed in networked communication. This work will result in state-of-the-art lightweight affect sensing and tactile display technologies and interaction techniques that can be used in concert or alone, and will advance both single-user human-computer interaction with networked data and group interaction in a networked scenario.","Information systems and technology","Information and communication services","Computer Science","MacLean, Karon","STPGP ","Information technology","Information technology","Technologie de l'information",2-3
"Touch is essential to many kinds of human communication in the real world. But in today's digital existence it is largely ignored - even in mobile and multitasking environments where screens, vision and attention are in short supply, and where much of our human contact occurs. This proposal addresses the design of haptic computer interactions (occurring through displays mediated by our sense of touch) for attentionally demanding and emotionally impoverished environments.

     This topic is highly relevant. We have yet to fully realize the benefits of the information revolution, but we are experiencing its pitfalls: our attention is often overloaded and fragmented, often during safety-critical tasks like driving a car. In a related way, virtualization of communication and activities endanger the emotional richness of personal interactions. Unchecked, this situation will proceed past the point of easy repair, as cognitive patterns are disrupted by the proliferation of information devices. 

     The next five years are a window where it is still possible to reach a future which delivers the promised benefits but is also livable. There is no question that haptic interfaces will play an important role: they offer an under-utilized communications channel, tangibility, aesthetic and high-resolution manual control, and a crucial component of emotional communication. They have the potential to reduce attentional demands and to support emotional connectedness. The high-level objectives of this research are therefore to:

     (a) Significantly expand foundational knowledge of basic human abilities and needs which will dictate how a new class of attentionally unintrusive interfaces must be designed, and lend insight on how people will use touch to communicate emotion remotely. These advances will relate to perception, attention and cognition, measurement of haptic affect, and human emotionally-directed touch.

     (b) Exercise and direct further basic study by deploying a suite of representative applications in simulated | and real contexts which exhibit a compelling need for improved interface support.

"This proposal describes the use of a microbial fermentation system to provide a source of an enzyme complex (RNA polymerase) used to study gene expression in our laboratory. Understanding how genes are expressed in bacteria is important for understanding the molecular nature of life and for many pursuits in industry and medicine including the discovery of new antibiotics.

In all life-forms, an enzyme complex called RNA polymerase is responsible for the expression of genes in cells. In bacteria, this complex itself cannot bind to DNA and it requires another enzyme subunit called sigma factor. Sigma factors bind RNA polymerase forming what is called holoenzyme and holoenzyme is capable of binding the promoter region of each gene and activating gene expression. Each bacterial species encodes one or more sigma factors that together ensure the coordinated expression of all genes in the cell. Our lab studies the molecular function of sigma factors including unusual forms of this protein found in some species. Recently, we discovered an unusual form of sigma factor in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. This sigma factor is composed of two individual proteins called YvrI and YvrHa and these enzymes work together to catalyze what is usually accomplished by a single protein sigma factor in holoenyzme. Our research plan proposes a series of projects that will help explain how this unusual two-subunit sigma factor interacts with RNA polymerase, and how the resulting holoenzyme recognizes and binds DNA to activate gene expression. In order to study these enzyme systems, we need to grow large amounts of bacterial cell culture. Equipment provided through this proposal will provide this capability and will be used in conjunction with other equipment required for the purification of RNA polymerase from bacterial cultures.

"To be able to attend, learn, and remember, we must possess a set of relevant cognitive skills that permit us to select, encode, and retrieve information.  These overarching skills are made up of processes, some more basic (playing central roles in many skills) and others more specialized.  The experience-based fluency of operation of these processes under a wide variety of conditions determines how well we process information.

     Research on attention, learning, and memory relies heavily on interference and facilitation as fundamental clues to the operation of cognitive processes.  Irrelevant information must be ignored; if not, interference (slowing and errors) results.  Previous relevant processing, and the resulting availability of related information, assists current processing; this is expressed as facilitation.  This proposal describes a continuing program of research having as its goal the understanding of fluent information processing.

     The proposed attention research examines our ability to restrict attention to one dimension in the face of competing information from another dimension that is fluently (automatically) processed.  New studies will expand on my longstanding work on the classic Stroop colour-word interference task.

     The proposed learning research will open a new domain of research in my program, bridging attention and memory.  The focus will be on implicit learning:  learning beneath awareness.  New work on the learning and relearning of implicit and even unattended associations will be featured.

     The proposed memory research features the contrast between explicit memory and implicit memory:  remembering with vs without awareness.  Proposed experiments include new work on ""the production effect"":  improved explicit (but not implicit) memory for information spoken aloud during study.

     In the longer term, the proposed new research and the corresponding theoretical developments will lead to a better overall understanding of the fluent processing underlying attention, learning, and memory, and to the development of practical skills -- such as improved study techniques -- for their optimization in everyday life.

risk of developing colon cancer. Our experiments using normal intestinal cells and colon cancer cells have shown that

calcium will stimulate a receptor on the surface of the cells known as the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor. We

now show that stimulating this receptor with calcium will reduce the production of the molecule as well as the receptor

for this molecule, understood to be required for the development of colon cancer in people with inflammatory bowel

disease. We will use mice which do not have the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor in their intestine, and feed these

mice increased calcium and Vitamin D 3 to demonstrate they are more susceptible to inflammation-associated colon

"Androgens enhance cognitive function, contributing to the normal sex differences in cognitive behavior observed in many vertebrates. How these effects occur remains unknown.  We have demonstrated that administration of androgens to castrated rats markedly increases the density of synapses on the apical dendritic spines of neurons in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Since increased spine synapse density in these areas of the brain is associated with learning and memory, we hypothesize that this effect may represent part of the mechanism for the positive effects of the steroids on cognitive function.  

Several aspects of the interaction between androgens and the brain suggest that the effects of the steroids on synaptic innervation in the hippocampus and PFC may involve novel cellular mechanisms. We propose that these may include direct interactions between androgens and neurotransmitter systems.  Using a combination of morphological, behavioral and neurochemical approaches, we propose to explore the mechanisms of androgen induced synaptic plasticity, as well as the temporal and quantitative relationships between the cognitive effects of androgen and the morphological responses of the hippocampus and PFC.  The effects of different doses and time courses of androgen treatment will be examined.  Pharmacological techniques and comparisons of the effects of different natural and synthetic steroids will be used to determine the role of androgen metabolism in the responses. Finally, the hypothesis will be tested that environmental chemical exposure may, under some circumstances, interfere with androgen responses. 

The results from these studies will provide an improved understanding of the mechanisms by which androgens alter synaptic plasticity, in regions of the brain involved in cognitive function. An improved knowledge of these mechanisms may help to understand normal sex differences in cognitive behavior, changes in cognition associated with age-related declines in gonadal hormone secretion, as well as the effects on cognitive function of exposure to endocrine-active environmental chemicals.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Biomedical Sciences","MacLusky, Neil","RGPIN ",Endocrinology,"Animal biology","Biologie animale",3-5

"The demand for energy worldwide has been rising at an accelerated pace and renewable energy is among Canada's current strategic plans. Thus, the need for effective energy storage methods has never been greater. Lithium-ion batteries (LIB) store more energy per volume than any other portable rechargeable battery. However, the energy density of future LIB will only improve significantly through radical changes to its active materials. Our research program aims to improve cathode and anode materials using nanomaterials prepared through innovated biologically assisted and colloidal metal synthetic routes. First, we propose to synthesize metal phosphate cathode material within an apoferritin cage, a protein used by the human body to store iron. The phosphate will be limited to the size of the protein cage (~8 nm), a nearly 10-fold reduction in size compared to traditional synthesis methods. This should provide a considerable increase in its conductivity. Also, the use of a room temperature synthesis instead of a high temperature solid state method will provide a more eco-friendly energy storage material. Second, we aim to reduce the inactive component of LIB metal-based anodes through novel solution-based ""bottom-up"" approaches to nanoparticle (NP) synthesis. We will focus on metal electrodes, optimizing various morphologies (dots, wire, core/shell) through numerous synthetic parameters (ligands, temperature, time). The advantage of colloidal metal NPs for LIB anodes is that their passivation protects sensitive elements towards oxidation and prevents the aggregation of the metal particles upon reaction with lithium. This will realize new metal anodes capable of alloying reversibly with large amounts of lithium leading to improve cell density. Our program will therefore combine elements of novel synthetic techniques for nanomaterials while developing a fundamental understanding of state-of-the-art nano-electrode materials that will lead to a breakthrough for today's energy storage technology.

"In about 5-10% of pregnancies in North America, labour occurs pre-term and is associated with a very high rate of neonatal death and morbidity. The underlying reason(s) for the majority of pre-term births are a mystery because scientists do not fully understand the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of uterine smooth muscle function during pregnancy. Uterine smooth muscle cells anchor to their outside environment called the extracellular matrix. These cells accomplish this task via spotweld-like structures named focal adhesions. Focal adhesions consist of extracellular matrix receptor proteins named integrins and signalling enzymes such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK).  As a signalling complex, focal adhesions can send biochemical signals to targets such as small heat shock proteins.  Our research program will investigate the regulation and functional significance of integrin and small heat shock protein gene expression in uterine smooth muscle cells. We will also characterize the role of FAK signalling in uterine smooth muscle cell contraction. Our discoveries will provide crucial insight into the mechanisms of uterine smooth muscle function during pregnancy and, as a result, potentially aid the development of effective therapeutic strategies to prevent pre-term labour.","Medical and health sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Medicine, Faculty of","MacPhee, Daniel","RGPIN ","Cell biology","Cell biology","Biologie cellulaire",3-5

"Fine-grained sediments (e.g. shales) are common on the Earth's surface. They are important resources because they generate hydrocarbons in petroleum systems and are raw materials for the heavy ceramic industry (e.g. brick making, filer manufacture etc.). Their fine grain size, apparent homogeneity in hand specimen, and susceptibility to weathering, make them difficult to study. Consequently, they are poorly known relative to other sedimentary rock types.

    Most geologists who have investigated the origins of these lithologies have used proxy methods (e.g. analyses of their whole rock compositions, organic matter contents, isotope ratios) to inform their investigations. From these they have typically concluded that mudstones were mostly deposited in very low energy settings. With different sediment types resulting from changing sediment inputs to the basin, production in the water column, and how much dissolved oxygen was present at deposition. Recently geologists, utilising high-resolution imaging techniques, have discovered that mud is much more chemically and texturally heterogeneous than had been previously assumed. Specifically, these studies indicate that the sediment was commonly reworked prior to deposition, before being deposited from high-energy, sediment-laden, bottom-hugging currents. Moreover, because of the effects of varying sediment inputs form rivers and biological evolution, the composition of these materials has changed fundamentally over geological time.

     These new observations raise many scientific questions in the minds of geologists. Including: a) how is mud moved offshore over the seafloor and do the similar transport processes operate all over the basin? b) Which planktonic organisms contribute the production-derived components in very old rocks? The research I propose to perform will investigate these problems, using high resolution imaging techniques integrated with geochemical analyses. This problems are significant to Canadians, because they have direct relevance to oil company exploration strategies.

"Riparian wetlands have been identified as important landforms that effectively reduce the loading of chemicals from agricultural lands, yet nitrate loading in ground water and surface water remains a problem. This is particularly evident in the Great Lakes Region, where the lakes continue to be impacted by agricultural practices. An improved understanding of when and why riparian wetlands do not attenuate nitrate is needed, particularly in the Great Lakes region, where the threat of increased climatic variability exists.

   Much attention has been given to the physical characteristics of riparian wetlands and upland fields in assessing riparian zone function, but little attention has been given to temporal patterns in the fate and transport of nitrogen. Pre-event antecedent conditions may play an important role in governing temporal patterns in nitrogen dynamics through their effect on soil nitrogen transformations, runoff pathways, and the interaction of these two variables. 

   Using a mixture of field observations and laboratory experimentation, the objectives of this research are to: (1) identify and quantify the hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on nitrogen fate and transport in riparian soils; 2) characterize hydrologic controls on the fate and transfer of nitrogen in an agricultural riparian wetland in Southern Ontario when hydrochemical inputs to the wetland originate from dual sources (upland, upstream); and (3) quantify the effects of antecedent hydrologic conditions (AHC) on event-based nitrogen transfer. 

   The future combined impacts of land-use and climate change in agricultural watersheds on surface water quality cannot be overstated; the potential reduction in the natural services provided by riparian buffer wetlands must be understood in order to develop effective future management strategies. This work will be useful in environmental models and will also be of use to managers in their effective management of Canadian water resources.

"The requested instrumentation will be used primarily for the controlled culture of mammalian cells, an essential procedure for the researchers submitting the application and for others who work in the Department of Biology. The equipment will be employed for characterization of DNA, RNA and proteins in cells during normal growth and when exposed to environmental and physiological stress, including disease.  Dr. MacRae analyzes gene expression and protein synthesis during Artemia embryo development and diapause, a state of physiological dormancy and enhanced stress tolerance. Protein structure/function relationships and the contribution of molecular chaperones to cell survival during diapause are considered in his work. Dr. Pohajdak studies intracellular transport of proteins in natural killer cells, major mediators of immunity. Much of the work entails examination of protein-protein interactions involving the adaptor CASP (Cytohesin Associated Scaffolding Protein) which interacts with members of the cytohesin/ARNO family. The research of both applicants represents fundamental contributions to cell, molecular and developmental biology, and there are many applications. Dr. MacRae's research relates to the role of molecular chaperones in heart disease, cataract, and neurological disorders. Examination of diapause may reveal how insects resist stress, this of importance in agriculture and forestry where these organisms are often pests. A greater understanding of diapause will enhance the use of Artemia as feed in aquaculture. Dr. Pohajdak's research contributes to our understanding of the immune system in recognization and elimination of cancer cells. Clearly, there is potential to make discoveries which have direct consequences to health and commerce through use of the incubators sought herein. The equipment will also facilitate experiments addressing basic questions which are the cornerstone of many research programs, thus placing the applicants at a definite advantage in the effective use of grant funds and the ability to conduct modern experimentation in several biological disciplines.

"New contractile materials will be investigated that promise to greatly exceed the performance of muscle. In these actuators voltage is used to drive ions to the electrode surfaces.  The electrodes are sufficiently thin that the electrostatic forces on their surfaces that result from this charging lead to electrode expansion, with discharging resulting in contraction.  This approach has previously been used to actuate carbon nanotube fibres and electrodes formed from platinum nanoparticles.  Our objective is to create exceptional performance by exploring the actuation of bundles very thin shape memory alloy wires and conducting elastomers.  The research is high risk, but has the potential to create low voltage artificial muscle useful in robots, prostheses, medical devices and automobiles.

"Recent technological breakthroughs in laser cooling have made the study of ultracold atoms one of the most attractive and active research fields in the physical sciences for the last 10 years. The broad impact and importance of ultracold atoms and related technologies were highlighted by the award of the 1997, 2001, and 2005 Nobel prizes in physics. At the same time, interest in cold molecules has begun to explode in the last five years. It is now widely accepted that ultracold molecules offer access to the same science as cold atoms and also to completely new possibilities, beyond those offered by cold atoms, to study a wide range of fundamental and practical questions in both physics and chemistry. The importance of ultracold molecules in relation to ultracold atoms arises from the features of molecules which make them distinct from atoms.  These features are that the particle-particle interactions can be much larger, have a richer spatial structure, and have a longer range than in atoms. Molecules also have additional internal degrees of freedom, including rotations and vibrations, absent in atoms.  Ensembles of ultracold molecules are therefore a treasury of new frontiers in both chemistry and physics. 



This research program has two long-term fundamental goals: the creation and application of ultracold atom and polar molecule ensembles to 1) the study of quantum materials (strongly interacting quantum systems) and 2) the study of ultracold physical chemistry - where reaction dynamics are no longer stochastic but can be controlled coherently by external magnetic and electric fields. An additional applied goal of this research program is to develop a miniature and portable atom-chip based laser cooling device to serve as a platform for the eventual realization of commercially viable clocks and sensors based on cold atoms.

"Water scarcity and competition for limited supplies of water are forcing irrigators and the irrigation industry to design more efficient irrigation systems and develop water conservation strategies. Although much is known about the water use efficiency (WUE) of surface drip systems, there have been few studies on WUE of subirrigation and buried drip irrigation in Quebec. While subirrigation increases crop yields in dry years and reduces nitrate concentrations in tile drainage effluent, it could increase phosphorus loads in both surface runoff and tile drainage flows.  Studies have also shown that the soil moisture distribution both above and below buried drip irrigation lines is not uniform and could affect crop growth and yields.  

    A five year research program, comprised of field and greenhouse experiments and a computer modeling component, will therefore be undertaken to evaluate and compare the WUE, water quality implications and soil moisture distribution patterns of subirrigation, buried drip irrigation, and surface drip irrigation. A novel technique of sap flow measurement to quantify crop water uptake and WUE will be tested in the greenhouse. The field experiment comprised of two subirrigation treatments, two drip line spacings, and two buried drip line depths, will assess WUE, nitrate and total phosphorus concentrations in drainage water, and soil moisture distribution patterns. The CERES-Maize computer simulation model will be tested and calibrated using the data from the greenhouse and field experiments, and then used to develop water conservation strategies for the 3 irrigation systems under a range of environmental conditions.

    The significance of this research is that water use efficiency will be increased and     )	water pollution reduced, thus making agricultural production systems more economic and environmentally sustainable. Graduate students will be trained in irrigation system design, water use efficiency, water quality improvement, and crop water dynamics modeling. This will empower them to pursue careers aimed at solving the current world water crisis.

"I plan to work on several topics in applied probability and combinatorics.



1.  Lattice models of polymers:  A long flexible polymer molecule (such as polyethylene or DNA) can be modeled as a ""self-avoiding walk""---a path in space (or in a three-dimensional grid) that does not cross itself.  Other polymers have elaborate branching structure, and are modeled by ""lattice animals""---connected clusters of line segments in space (or in the grid).  I will investigate questions about these models from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint, including:  What can we say about the occurrence of knots on a long polymer, or about linking in a network of branched polymers?  If there is strong self-attraction between the different parts of the polymer, will a large polymer collapse into a ball?  



2.  Markov chain Monte Carlo:  This is a common method of computer simulation used in statistics, physics, and other fields.  In this method, it is crucial to run the simulation long enough for it to settle into equilibrium.  I shall obtain rigorous methods to help researchers decide in advance how long a run will be required for a simulation to achieve equilibrium.



3.  Pattern-avoding permutations: This is a problem in pure combinatorics.  A permutation is an arbitrary ordering of the numbers 1 to N (for a given number N).  How many permutations ""avoid the pattern 4231""---i.e. how many of them do not contain numbers w,x,y,z (appearing in that order) such that wxyz is in the same relative order as 4231 (w largest, z smallest, and x<y)?  The answer is approximately some number L raised to the power N, but the value of L is unknown.  I will investigate rigorous and experimental (simulation) bounds on L.  I willl also look at properties that are shared by ""most"" 4231-avoiding permutations.

"The concept of system robustness is scrutinized with the objective of integrating it into a decision analytical framework. A stochastic interpretation of robustness refers to the ability of systems (engineering, environmental, human systems) to confront unexpected or exceptional hazards without causing excessive consequences to the system constituents. Robustness involves casual events, propagating and indirect consequences, and extreme events. It is therefore amenable to quantitative risk analysis and decision making which includes the planning and optimization of infrastructural design, inspection and maintenance. The key framework of analysis is the use of hierarchical system models, which consist of sub-models or components that are not only logically and stochastically linked but also allow for consequences and risk to be passed on and shared.



In order to meet these objectives new decision-making frameworks will be developed for both (1) operational decision making (such as optimal design decision making and robustness constrained optimization) and (2) strategic decision making (which targets robustness issues in maintenance planning, optimal inspection strategies, and risk mitigation in general). This requires the use of new tools including (1) dynamic real-time updatable probabilistic models for consequences and preference making which are becoming increasingly important and complex in our ""global"" infrastructure, (2) easy-to-use risk-based indicators for system robustness that can be used effectively in optimization and risk mitigation, (3) the use of hierarchical Bayes methods (HBM) and Bayesian Probability Nets (BPN) which easily allow for the updating of limit states that are spatially dependent within a large system or network exposed to various hazards.

"Recent increase in aluminum spot welding applications has created a high demand for the means of quality assurance of aluminum spot welds. The in-depth understanding of metallurgical and mechanical properties of aluminum joints is needed to properly characterize the weld quality. The analysis of growth, deformation and fracture of A1 spot-welded joints, and use of this knowledge to make predictions about the weld performance, would greatly enhance the safety of automotive structures. That is why development of real-time acoustic method for metallurgical analysis of spot grain structure and fatigue properties would result in creation of the unique database of A1 spot weld properties and acoustic data for spot weld characterization. 

Although the general principles of aluminum spot welding are similar, there is a set of distinct differences from steel welding. These differences make application of the ultrasonic system for steel welding impossible for analysis of aluminum welding. Our preliminary trials on welding and testing aluminum joints using the equipment for steel welding have proven the necessity to develop a different system with some physical and technological principles borrowed from our well-developed steel welding characterization technique. 

The goal of this proposed research is to develop a new technology for real-time characterization of the aluminum resistance spot welds using an ultrasonic transducer incorporated into the weld gun electrode. The research will rely heavily on the finite element modeling of the processes of weld formation and acoustic wave propagation through the weld structure. These results will be used for development of the new transducer and other hardware to fit the requirements of the aluminum weld characterization. The research will involve the us of neural network for proper weld quality characterization based on acoustic signal processing. The computer modeling will be conducted in parallel with the extensive experimental trials using the most recent industrial equipment for better understanding of wave propagation within the structure of molten weld and for prediction~ of the most reliable acoustic parameters for weld quality characterization.

"Adhesives and composite materials are widely used in various industries; however, their applications are currently limited due to 1) the lack of data on the adhesive joint's long-term stability, 2) methods allowing evaluating microdefects during joint service and 3) methodology that allows us to predict the lifetime of the adhesive joint. It is known that most of the failures during joint service are caused by environmental degradation. 

The proposed project is a theoretical and experimental study of changes that occur in the properties and structure of adhesive and nano-composite joints during environmental degradation. Influence of chemicals, humidity and temperature alterations as well as stress and vibration will be studied and parameters most critical for joint durability will be identified. We intend to reveal morphological, physical and chemical changes in the material, which lead to a decrease of its strength performance. Special attention will be devoted to the investigation of the joint's interface because this region is the most susceptible to the environmental attack. We plan to use various methods and techniques such as acoustic microscopy, light and electron microscopy, infrared spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry, microhardness and mechanical tests. 

The results obtained will help us to understand more deeply the influence of environmental factors on the durability of the adhesive joint. A combination of experimental data with theoretical calculations will help to develop methodology for predicting the adhesive's life expectancy. Acoustic methods developed for visualizing the adhesive microstructure and showing the correlation of acoustic images with mechanical parameters of the joint can be an extremely valuable tool in industrial non-destructive evaluation of adhesive joint quality.

"Our research will harness Canada's own natural resources to fuel the bioeconomy with a stream of bioactive

compounds to the Canadian pharmaceutical industry. Small molecules produced by microbes are a rich source

of clinical drugs widely used as treatments in infectious disease, cancer, immunosuppressive therapy, and heart

disease. This research proposal focuses on the discovery and development of bioactive compounds derived

from marine microbial mats, inhabiting some of the most extreme environments in the world and biodiverse in

Canada. We suggest that to survive and compete in such varied environments, microbes have developed

chemical defense mechanisms, which can be harnessed for human therapeutics.

A strategic network of collaborators has been gathered across Canada and the Americas to amass a collection

of giant sulphur-oxidizing marine microbes (Beggiatoa and Thioploca). From this collection, we plan to isolate

and sequence DNA, extract bioactive compounds, and develop microbial factories to produce large quantities

of medicinal compounds for pharmaceutical development in conjunction with our industrial partners.

Powerful new molecular approaches to natural products have emerged and reinvigorated the search for targeted

therapeutics from nature, and Canadian-based private industries are leaders in this field. We have formed

partnerships with two such companies, Thallion Pharmaceuticals Inc. and ACD Labs.

Leveraging the unique expertise assembled for this Strategic Program Grant will harness a new and unique

reservoir of bioactive compounds in a fashion that will greatly advance natural product discovery and

development for the benefit of the Canadian economy within the next 10 years.

In a given organism (be it human or any other developed organism) there are millions and millions of cells, but we know very little about how these cells communicate with each other. These communication networks are critical important to the normal function of an organism. At present, we know in many cases cell-to-cell interactions are mediated by small chemical molecules that act as messengers. Finding these messengers is very difficult, and without them we can not fully appreciate how the individual cells can coordinate their functions to become a multicellular organism. 



To find these chemical messages we will use chemical techniques, genomic tools and genetic cloning. The signals that are the focus of this grant are made in the same way as many of antibiotics (i.e. penicillin) to treat infectious disease. Since the discovery of antibiotics such as penicillin we have learned a lot about how these types of molecules are made. We and others have found that the way cells make antibiotics is also used to make chemical messengers that allow cells to communication.



In this proposal we seek to identify small molecule chemical signals from a model bacterium (Myxococcus xanthus) that often grows as a collective of cells and a putative signal encoded within the human genome.

"The chemical synthesis of carbon based compounds has been a major field of scientific curiosity for over a century, and the subject is still far from being fully developed.  As our knowledge of chemical sciences (both fact and theory) has grown so has the power of synthesis.  The construction of organic compounds now includes the use of reactions and reagents involving more than sixty of the chemical elements, even though only a dozen or so elements are commonly contained in commercially or biologically significant molecules.  Our group is interested in the development of new and/or simpler ways to make biologically exciting and structurally challenging natural products in optically pure form.  Although nature is the usual supplier of these ""new drugs"", it is often times only in very small quantities, in one optical form (the particular arrangement of atoms in 3-dimensional space) and/or not in the most ""potent"" structure.  It is then incumbent upon the synthetic organic chemist to not only make these new compounds in an optically pure form (as cheaply as possible), but also to make them as active as possible (allowing for small doses to be taken) and as specific as possible (little or no side affects).  Consequently, we are continuing a program designed at developing methodology to synthesize 7 and 8 membered ring carbocyclic compounds in optically enriched form. Concurrent with this project we are looking at expanding our previous work on ketene chemistry.  This will provide quick access to more highly functionalized systems that can be readily used for the synthesis of biologically important compounds, including anti-cancer compounds. The methodology will provide industry and academia new and more direct methods to synthesize these types of compounds, thus providing the potential for the development of new drugs for use in the treatment of diseases.","Physical sciences","Advancement of knowledge",Chemistry,"MaGee, David","RGPIN ","Organic syntheses","Organic chemistry","Chimie organique",3-5

"Computers rely on algorithms, pre-definied sets of rules, to solve problems. But some problems are simply too difficult and do not allow for an exact solution in a reasonable amount of time even when the input size is modest. In such cases researchers have resorted to ""approximation algorithms"" that work in reasonable amount of time and yet 

do not compromise too much in the accuracy of their solutions. 



As the field of approximation algorithms matured, the algorithms that were being designed tended to fall into one of a relatively small number of algorithmic-paradigms.

My particular research focuses on some of these approaches, mainly ones that are based on geometric considerations. The first is the ""semidefinte relaxations"" 

approach, in which we look at a problem with relaxed conditions that is solvable, and the challenge is to relate it with the original one. This technique was shown to be very powerful and has gained much popularity in the last decade. In addition, I study the area of ""metric embedding"" where geometric simplifications are sought in order to transform a hard problem to a simpler one using distances as important parameters.



I am also interested in showing limitations these and other algorithmic paradigms, such as dynamic programming, greedy algorithms and backtracking algorithms have. Such insights may indicate new ways of finding algorithmic methods that overcome the obstacles the existing ones suffer from. 



Last, I am interested in finding sublinear-time algorithms to problems where the typical input size is too large even to be read completely.

"The long-term objective of the research proposed in this grant is the realization of wireless sensing and computing devices (""motes"") less than 100 cubic-mm in volume.  The scale considered for these devices suggests that they could form ultra dense networks consisting on the order of 100,000 motes.  Networks of this size are envisioned as distributed computing devices directly interfaced to our environment and capable of influencing it to our needs.  Reducing mote size increases the size of the network they can form and also increases the diversity of spaces to which this network can be introduced.  Today, motes displace roughly 100,000 cubic-mm and form networks of around 100 elements.  At present this technology has already been demonstrated as a useful tool for environmental monitoring, surveillance, and health care.



In the short-term, this research aims at two hardware innovations very important to the realization of useful motes.  Firstly, an ultra-low-power microelectronic wireless communicator will be designed.  Radios are fundamental to the formation of a mote network but today they constitute their most power hungry function (compared to sensing and computation).  Reducing the power consumption of the radio can lead to improvements in other domains such as size, computational complexity, etc.



The second short-term objective targets a mote facility of emerging interest to designers: the ability of the device to physically propel itself.  Specifically, this research seeks to realize a specialized computer capable of guiding a mobile mote through space.  This ""path planner"" is essentially a novel nonlinear dynamical controller readily amenable to implementation using analog circuits.  This path-planner will be implemented as a reconfigurable low-power analog computer on a single chip.

"Here we request a Gel documentation system for the Comparative Immunology Group. Comparative immunology, or the study of immune processes in animals is often measured by the expression of immune genes. Many components of our research involve visualizing DNA fragments. DNA is mixed with a dye that binds very specifically to the DNA, which when illuminated by UV light, shines bright red. Thus bands can be visualized on a UV box (transilluminator). Photographs can be taken of these bands for a permanent record. We can determine the size of a gene fragment by comparison with known standards, or the amount of a gene expressed by analyzing the density of the band. We can also excise the DNA from the gel to recover the gene to study its function in cell lines. This allows us to determine the response of an animal to disease organisms. This instrument will support all comparative immunologists and microbiologists working in area.  Our lab is studying how ducks fight the flu virus, since they are infected but unharmed by strains that kill chickens, pigs, and humans. Another program examines the regulation of the gene mutator used for antibody diversity, by studying the system in fish.

"Discrete problems in harmonic analysis, where the underlying space is the set of integers or integer points, have played an increasingly important role over the past twenty years. Besides their own intrinsic interests, they have appeared on the interface of harmonic analysis and other fields, such as analytic number theory, combinatorics and ergodic theory . The proposed research concerns two aspects of the above very general area.



The first part is related to previous work of Bourgain on pointwise convergence of ergodic averages over arithmetic subsets; as well as to the work of Stein and Wainger in which they have initiated a systematic study of discrete analogues of some central objects in analysis. These two sets of results are very closely related to each other; also connection with number theory is immediate, as in the discrete case the smooth objects like surfaces are replaced by integer points on surfaces defined by integral polynomials.



The second part is related to arithmetic Ramsey theory, an emerging field which has experienced a dramatic development over the past decade, initiated by the Fourier analytic proof of Gowers of Szemeredi's theorem. Here the basic type of problem is to show the existence of certain structures in ""dense"" subsets of a highly structured set, which can take many different forms, such as the integers or integer lattices, vector spaces over finite fields, discrete abelian groups and so on. Our aim is to extend the Fourier analytic method to some situations where its use has been limited, to certain problems of multiple recurrence, as well as to some partition problems, both of linear and of polynomial type.

"In nature, bacteria persist within surface-attached microbial communities called biofilms.  A hallmark of this mode of growth is resistance to the effects of antimicrobial agents.   This advantage is particularly important for bacteria that are found in the soil environment because they are routinely exposed to antimicrobial compounds produced by soil-dwelling organisms. Very little is known about how biofilm cells acquire this increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. We feel that in order to understand this phenomenon, it is crucial that genes involved in resistance be identified and their mechanisms of action be elucidated. To this end, we have developed and validated a method to identify genes that are important for the development of resistance to antibiotics. We have identified 7 genes using this method. This proposal concerns the characterization of 4 of these genes and the isolation of additional genes that are important for biofilm-specific resistance.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology","Mah, ThienFah","RGPIN ",Microbiology,Microbiology,Microbiologie,2-2
"Advances in sequencing technologies has enabled the genomic analysis of complex biological systems. Entire microbial communities in several environments including oceans, sub-surface aquifers and human gut have been sequenced leading to the availability of metagenomic information. This explosion in biological information at the molecular level motivates the development of computational methods to analyze the physiology of these communities. While such methods are available for the analysis of pure culture metabolism, methods for representing metabolic interactions in a community are required. We propose to develop such systems biology approaches based on stoichiometry and thermodynamics for analyzing metabolism in two communities, namely, 1) a co-culture of cellulolytic and solventogenic Clostridia for enhanced biofuel production and 2) a microbial community associated with reductive dechlorination for improving the bioremediation rate.

"Prediction of a process system behaviour (pharmaceutical, chemical, refining or similar plants) via simulation has enabled their optimal design and operation.  These systems are modeled by networks where nodes (equipment) transform energy or material, while arcs are material, energy, or information flows.  Current abilities to model process systems are limited by the accuracy of equipment models, as well as the algorithms for solving the entire network.  First principles equipment models often require a very large effort to achieve desired accuracy.  Models combining the first principles and empirical models (so called hybrid models) have been explored as an alternative.   At present there are no well defined methods that determine what types of equations to include in each part of a hybrid model.   Currently, process networks are simulated or optimized by algorithms that are inherently limited by being single computational processes on single CPUs and do not exploit multi-processor computing capabilities. 



Goal of the research is to enable an order of magnitude improvement in simulation speed for large process systems and a significant reduction of the effort required to build accurate plant equipment models by: 

I.    )	Development of typical hybrid model structures for specific types of equipments - thereby providing means for rapid equipment modeling. 

II.    )	A new class of computational architecture for a process network - simulation via node models that behave autonomously and can run simultaneously (agent-based network computations),  and

III.    )	Algorithms enabling optimization of discrete & continuous variables in such agent-based systems.  



The research will provide a basis for a new generation of applications in process design and optimal operation of processes in refining, polymers, pharmaceuticals, or chemicals for bio applications.

"Correlations between physiological variation and climate suggest that organismal physiology has been shaped primarily through natural selection by the abiotic environment.  However, the resource requirements and physiological tolerances of organisms change when they interact with competitors, predators, parasites and symbionts, suggesting that abiotic and biotic agents of selection interact to influence physiological adaptation.   Nevertheless, abiotic and biotic causes of evolutionary change are often disconnected in theories of physiological adaptation and rarely examined together in empirical studies.

   One important resource that has shaped the evolution of life on earth is water.  Drought is frequent and strongly limits plant productivity, suggesting that the timing and availability of rainfall has had a strong role in shaping the evolution of plant physiology.  Plants interact with many organisms, but symbiotic interactions between plant roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are particularly important for resource acquisition.  AMF colonization allows plants to maintain growth under depleted soil moisture, suggesting that plant-fungal interactions can increase drought tolerance. 

   I will determine how interactions with AMF influence the physiological mechanisms of plant adaptation to arid environments.  Specifically, I will test whether 1) natural selection favours the mechanisms thought to be important for drought adaptation implied by comparative studies and 2) adaptation to arid environments involves the evolution of increased plant dependence on AMF.  Because human activities are altering the abiotic environment through climate change and the biotic environment through species extinction, understanding the causes of physiological evolution is necessary to predict how populations will adapt to changing environments.  Many ecosystem processes are dominated by the physiological characteristics of the species they contain.  Therefore, understanding the causes of adaptive physiological evolution is also necessary to predict the long-term response of ecosystem functions and services to human activities.

"This project focuses on trust management in autonomous social networks (ASNs). The ASNs are a new class of social networks where people connect with each other in peer-to-peer manner rather than going through a centralized website. This has many benefits including: support for mobile and ad-hoc networks, lack of central site of failure or vulnerability, and lack of a central policy making entity. The ASNs are inspired by the success of many peer-to-peer applications in areas such as file sharing and voice-over-IP services. An ASN peer runs on each device (e.g., Microsoft Zune, Nokia Internet Tablet) that is part of the network. 



This project will focus on three aspects of trust management within ASNs: trust modeling, benchmarks for trust management systems, and applications of trust in the context of ASNs.

"Most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions causing climate change are associated with the burning of fossil fuels. Canada and many other countries have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but are having great difficulty in meeting their commitments. At the same time, oil and natural gas supplies are approaching a point where the availability of these fossil fuels will be increasingly limited. 

Biomass, as one of the largest sources of energy resorces in the world, is third only to coal and oil. The advantage of being CO2 neutral makes biomass a dominant choice for the replacement of fossil fuels as the concern of global warming increases. Biomass can be converted to various forms of energy through thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis and gasification. Despite the importance of biomass as a source of energy, the field of biomass conversion is, more or less, in its scientific infancy. The proposed research program is composed of two related themes, each focused on various tasks used in producing value-added products from biomass more effectively. The long term objectives of the research program are: gaining a thorough understanding and evaluation of the challenges that are hindering the implementation of biomass-fueled generation projects, understanding the general behaviour of the bio-oil production, producing a more stable bio-oil, and producing higher value added co-products such as hydrogen, methanol, ethanol, ammonia, and other valuable chemicals in efficient, cost effective, and environmentally sustainable methods.

The technology of the conversion of biomass to syngas and bio-oil via pyrolysis and gasification will be based on processes that are not only efficient and effective, but also economical and environmentally sustainable. It will fulfill our aim of developing a long-term greenhouse gas mitigation technology with specific focus on the energy sector. This will establish Canada as the pioneer country for reduction of CO2 emissions on a global scale. The results of this project will be of use to energy sector as they continue to review possible technologies to utilize waste biomass while reducing CO2 emissions.

"Light metals usage in the automotive industry continues to increase with the demand for improved fuel economy and performance through weight savings. Cast products have shown good market penetration by replacing ferrous based components such as cylinder heads and through part consolidation. While light metals usage may advance vehicle energy efficiency, continuous improvement is needed in the upstream processes to increase yield and production energy efficiency. The development of strategies to eliminate casting defects has historically been a trial and error process, but in recent years, the advent of increased computational capabilities, has led to the use of computers to model casting operations and provide quantitative knowledge of casting systems. One of the main difficulties in developing comprehensive quantitative models of casting processes is describing the link between micro and macro scale phenomena. Mushy zone permeability is a good example of this challenge as the coupling between mushy zone microstructure and the resistance to flow continues to be investigated.  



The proposed research program is focused on developing new fundamental knowledge on the role that permeability plays in defining the mushy zone. In order to achieve this objective, the program will combine experimental determination of permeability in an industrially relevant alloy with mathematical modeling of fluid flow at the scale of the microstructure. The knowledge gained from the physical testing and modeling will be used to investigate the impact of permeability description on the mushy zone in real castings.

"This research is aimed at improving the economic viability of producing oil and gas from deposits of marginal quality.  We are investigating ways of extending the applicability of existing recovery processes to difficult reservoirs and we are exploring new recovery concepts that will allow environmentally sustainable exploitation of such reservoirs.  



Vapex is a non-thermal bitumen and heavy oil recovery process involving injection of vaporized light hydrocarbons via a horizontal well and draining the diluted bitumen via another parallel horizontal well placed near the base of the reservoir.  Our work is focused on improving the efficiency of this process with optimization of solvent composition and developing improved mathematical modeling capabilities.  Sequestration of CO2 in the depleted Vapex patterns is also of interest.  We also plan to evaluate the applicability of Vapex in depleted cold heavy oil production reservoirs.



Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage is currently the mainstay of in situ bitumen recovery and is used in commercial operations.  However, it is not economical in marginal reservoirs due to high capital and operating costs for much smaller volumes of oil production.  We are investigating possible improvements in this process with optimization of well configurations and addition of hydrocarbon solvents to injected steam.



Gas from methane hydrate deposits that exist in the permafrost regions and coastal waters of Canada is expected to become an important source of energy in couple of decades.  We are studying the formation and decomposition behaviour of gas hydrates in porous media.  This work is aimed at developing techniques for recovering natural gas from such hydrate deposits.

"We propose to develop advanced laser-based optical instruments at the University of Manitoba that will open up new application areas of ultrafast optics in nonlinear optical microscopy, optical coherence tomography and spectroscopy of biological samples as well as microelectronic materials. The proposed setups are based on a wavelength tunable pulsed laser system. The operation of this state-of-the-art laser system requires an excitation source. This application requests funds for its development using a simple, efficient, reliable and cost-effective design. 



The developed excitation source will enable us to engage in detailed investigations of cellular hydrodynamics, broadband spectroscopy of advanced dielectric materials and development of novel instrumental solutions for biomedical imaging applications. Three novel instruments will be developed for these research projects using the requested excitation source: a nonlinear laser microscope and the setups for optical coherence tomography and broadband spectroscopy. The projects will create an opportunity for a broad range of innovative long-term interdisciplinary research programs. They will also enhance professional training of students and research personnel in biomedical and laser optics, live cell imaging, image and signal processing, nonlinear spectroscopy, optical and electronic materials. The unique capabilities of new instrumentation will be available to a large community of scientists at the University of Manitoba and beyond through collaborative research projects.

"Terahertz radiation (THz, electromagnetic waves that are 0.03-3 mm long) has many unique properties that make it particularly attractive for remote sensing, chemical analysis and quality monitoring. THz waves are strongly absorbed by water, reflected by metal, but can easily penetrate paper or plastic packaging. In addition, many of the common materials have distinctive absorption ""signatures"" in this wavelength range. This make is possible not only to selectively identify specific materials, but also to obtain valuable information about their chemical composition. Industries such as food, pharmaceutical, biomedical, chemical, dairy, security, etc. will greatly benefit from applications of THz technology. At this moment, however, development of practical THz systems for real-world applications is severely limited by the lack of compact, powerful and efficient sources of this radiation. This research project is focused on the development of such THz emitters based on innovative laser and semiconductor technology. The work will be done in close collaboration with a leading Canadian company in the THz field, T-Ray Science Inc. The results of this project will enable T-Ray Science to develop reliable and cost-effective THz systems for spectroscopic analysis and imaging. This will make a significant contribution towards the availability of appropriate and affordable THz technology for many potential applications.

Biophotonics harnesses unique properties of light and applies them to address different problems in biological and medical sciences. Optical microscopy and spectroscopy of biological systems is one such application.



The proposed research program will focus on development and application of novel optical microscopy and spectroscopy techniques based on advanced laser systems producing ultra short pulses of light. Interaction of these intense laser pulses with a medium results in production of various optical signals each of which carries specific information about the sample. The proposed unique microscopic imaging techniques will use these signals to obtain information about water viscosity inside of single living cells without perturbing their normal functions. Microscopic imaging results will be also complemented by spectroscopic investigations. Accurate information about intracellular water dynamics is vital to understanding of the functioning of living cells and can contribute, for example, to better diagnostics of a wide range of diseases. 



The project will involve development of an advanced laser system, design and construction of a novel microscope and their application to imaging and spectroscopy of different biological and other specimens. It will also provide strong training in cutting-edge optical biotechnologies to students at all levels.

"Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are among the most crucial molecules of the cell. So far, more than 600 different RNA families have been found. One of them, microRNAs, is found involved in how our genes are produced. This function is key to our immune system, to how our cells differentiate and specialize, to how cancer develops and progresses, and how our cells decide to die. It is believed that building artificial molecular devices to control these cellular mechanisms will help resolve many problems in human health and therapeutics, but also in food and energy production, and environment. However, before we can engineer such effective devices we need to understand in details how the cell adopt its behaviours in function of its gene production. In fact, it is believe that the cell functions using a very complex gene regulatory network, where each gene has an effect on several others. Recently, RNA-based devices have been engineered to process and transmit simple cellular information by reading and targeting the gene regulatory network. In some ways, these devices can be seen as small computers that act on the gene regulatory networks. In order to build such cellular computers, we need to know the three-dimensional structures of their RNA components. However, technical problems refrain us from resolving these structures using classical experimental methods (for example X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance). Dr. Major is an expert in the development of computational methods to determine RNA three-dimensional structures, an alternative to costly experimental approaches. He recently introduced a new approach that is very promising, which was published this year in the renowned journal Nature. In this grant proposal, he proposes to develop further this new approach to especially explore and analyze the dynamic components of RNA-based cellular computers. He aims at putting his new algorithms in the hands of the experimentalists, since rapidly and reliably producing precise and accurate RNA 3D structures will yield immense benefits to the biotechnology and biomedical fields. During the term of this research, Dr. Major will train two to three postdoctoral trainees and three to four PhD students.

"The availability of computing systems and communication networks at a reasonable cost is rapidly increasing the deployment of parallel and distributed systems. A grid that provides on-demand access to computing, storage, communication and various other types of resources that include wireless devices and sensors is receiving a great deal of attention in various fields including scientific, engineering as well as enterprise computing. Achieving a desired level of quality of service, scalability, high resource utilization and robustness are important for an effective deployment of such systems. Effective management of resources is crucial in achieving these system objectives. With the rapid evolution in both hardware and software technologies inter-operability on a heterogeneous environment is becoming an important requirement for distributed applications that utilize the system resources described earlier. Middleware is the glue that provides such inter-operability.  Due to the multi-billion dollar investment in Web Services (WS) technologies by major software companies, many inter-operable systems of the future are expected to be WS-based. Although WS-based systems can provide inter-operability, if not designed carefully, the concomitant system overhead can give rise to severe performance penalties. Research is proposed for resource management on grids as well as on high performance WS-based systems. The research results will be useful in application design, operating systems, and middleware for grids and other web services-based parallel/distributed systems.

The applicant is involved in research on resource management and middleware for distributed systems for a number of years and his work includes pioneering research on parallel job scheduling. His activity in the past six years is reflected in 10 journal papers, 3 contributions to books, a number of refereed conference papers and invited contributions, chairing conference and program committees, and selection as a Distinguished Visitor for the IEEE Computer Society. The applicant's experience, as well as the high caliber graduate students and the facilities available at Carleton University will be useful in achieving the project objectives.

"Modern day financial markets offer and trade increasingly more complex, ""exotic"" products. A path-dependent derivative is a financial contract whose value depends on the time history of values of other, more basic, underlying financial variables. Path-dependent options have become increasingly popular over the last few years because of the greater precision with which they allow investors to choose or avoid exposure to well-defined sources of risk. Pricing of such derivatives is a non-trivial problem in quantitative finance. For nonlinear diffusion models, exact pricing formulas for many general path dependent options such as Asian style options are not known, and, moreover, accurate and efficient numerical pricing algorithms are rather scarce. The primary aim of this research program is the development of efficient computational algorithms for pricing financial derivatives under exactly solvable nonlinear diffusion models. Due to the numerically intensive nature of pricing path-dependent options, particularly in many underlying dimensions, a significant part of this research involves the development of parallel algorithms to be implemented on the high performance computing clusters. The other focus of this program is on the solvable diffusion models. For a solvable model, the transition probability density functions and other quantities that are fundamental to derivatives pricing are represented in closed form. The solvability of a diffusion model allows us to construct exact simulation algorithms avoiding approximate schemes. Finally, since the existing models do not always succeed in capturing the behaviour of market option prices accurately and realistically enough across various underlying market variables, the program will be aimed at the development of new pricing models based on the unification of a solvable diffusion model, a switching Markov process, and stochastic time change with jumps.

"Biomedical engineers need solid engineering skills in medical technology and also strong professional skills and business knowledge in the areas of intellectual property, medical device regulation and starting new ventures. Indeed, growth in medical-device technology is increasingly being driven by entrepreneurs.

     Training will occur in three areas: (i) Diagnostic and Therapeutic Technologies, including joint motion tracking and imaging, cardiac and respiratory function technologies, surgical tools for brain and gastrointestinal surgery; (ii) Implantable Devices, including biomaterials research for implant and drug-delivery technologies; and (iii) Rehabilitative and Assistive Devices, including cochlear implants, robotics and mobility aids such as advanced joint braces and wheelchairs.

     Our program integrates this core training with skills in areas necessary for direct translation of research. We have developed partnerships with the Faculty of Management, and support from government, industry and hospital stakeholders. Students will develop thesis projects focused on biomedical devices and receive training in (i) biomedical engineering theory and practice (ii) understanding the clinical environment and clinical needs for biomedical technology and iii) business, intellectual property, regulatory and product financing knowledge and skills. Training will also include onsite industry experience both nationally and internationally. 

     Our team brings expertise from engineering and science, and includes several clinician entrepreneurs with a history of training science and engineering graduates. Most of our team works closely with industry and many have formed companies. This proposal has garnered financial and in-kind support from government and industry stakeholders and our industry partners range from orthopaedic to hearing technology, from local to international and from small to large companies. This initiative seeks to fill a gap in current biomedical engineering education both regionally and nationally and produce graduates with skills to more effectively stimulate research, development and economic growth in biomedical devices.

"When working with nanoscale objects it is necessary to replace direct observation by human senses by microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) looks ""inside"" materials similarly to X-rays looking ""inside"" people. In this sense it is complementary to scanning probe techniques such as STM and AFM. TEM experiments often allow quantitative interpretation at better than one nanometer spatial resolution. The applications of advanced TEM range from catalysts and semiconductor materials and devices to life science samples. The need to expand limits of electron microscopy is dictated by the necessity to provide Canada's researchers and industry with ongoing access to state-of-the-art quantitative characterization of nanomaterials. The goal of the electron microscopy research is to achieve and maintain world leadership and reputation in aspects of electron microscopy of interest to NINT research community and industrial partners. The aim of this proposal is to develop strong electron microscopy expertise which, together with NINT's state-of-the-art instrumentation, will continuously attract a wide range of external collaborations in nanoscience to NINT. In particular the EM research is focused on pushing the boundaries of electron holography for quantitative characterization of electrostatic and magnetic fields at resolution better than 1 nm, electron energy loss spectroscopy for chemical composition and bonding characterization of nanomaterials and interfaces and on cryomicroscopy of proteins and sub-cellular biological materials. The goals will be achieved by pursuing improved understanding of physical principles underlying data interpretation, by innovative experiment design and by building inexpensive hardware additions. Consequently the instrument capabilities will retain their cutting edge status for an extended period of time.

"CALPHAD method is used for constructing thermodynamic models of phases via a simultaneous treatment of experimental data on the thermodynamic properties of phases and multiphase mixtures, and on the conditions of phase equilibria. Despite a thermodynamic flavour, the method is in fact a non-linear least squares technique resulting in a statistically optimal vector of models' parameters along with their covariance matrix. An analysis of the solution obtained requires that input data possess certain statistical characteristics. In particular, it is necessary to ascribe a reasonable experimental error to each measurement, and to ensure that its connotation conforms to that adopted in mathematical statistics. In reality, a painstaking analysis of experimental errors is often replaced with their estimations reflecting a personal opinion and experience of an expert proposing these estimations. Instead of speculating whether this widespread practice is good or bad, let us realize that it strips the ""experimental errors"" of their statistical meaning. It should also be noticed that in many contemporary publications, an accuracy of observations is not paid attention, that tables of experimental data are more and more frequently replaced with figures visualizing these data. It is not a problem to scan and digitize these illustrations; the problem is that scanning and digitizing lead to statistically meaningless quantities. It is not intended to commence a hopeless struggle against a reproachable way in which experimental knowledge is disseminated today. It is contemplated to augment the CALPHAD method by a new assessment technique based on the ideas and algorithms of a non-statistical treatment of experimental information formulated by Leonid V. Kantorovich and successfully employed for solving economic problems. The new procedure will yield not the vector of models' parameters, but a region (not necessarily convex) of their values within which one can try to satisfy additional criteria such as an absence of inverted miscibility gaps or false inflection points along phase boundaries. For any point from this region, it guaranteed that back-calculated quantities are confined within a non-statistical corridor of ""ultimate errors"" associated with all experimental observations.","Materials sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Materials Science and Engineering","Malakhov, Dmitri","RGPIN ","Materials science and technology","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",2-5

"Inter-American Materials Research Collaboration in Materials (CIAM). In 2004-2007 we obtained a CIAM Mobility Grant with the same partner in Colombia. This enabled exchanges between our laboratories and led to successful research which opened new opportunities such as the current proposal. Thermal Non Destructive Evaluation (TNDE) is one of the NDE methods used for materials inspection along with other techniques such as X-Rays, Ultrasonics, etc. TNDE has unique advantages such as the possibility to inspect wide surfaces rapidly, it is non-contact, not harmful, requires access to the part from one side only, etc. However, - as other NDE methods - it is afflicted by several problems such as a high sensitivity to noise (for instance spurious reflections from the background, local variations of surface emissivity) and non-uniform heating (heat stimulation is required to get thermal response of the part and thus capability to detect subsurface defects because of their different response with respect to sound material). The objectives of this proposal is to take advantage of the expertise of our Colombian partner specialized in thermal quadrupole method to help solving some of the problems associated with TNDE. Our objectives are thus three-fold: - Objective #1: Obtain an analytical definition of phase contrast (phase contrast is known to be robust for defect assessment and thus is interesting to study). - Objective #2: Establish a method to locate a sound area suitable to compute the phase contrast. The availability of the analytical definition of phase contrast would enable the extrapolation of its value anywhere in the infrared image after the initial thermal pulse heating and thus a link between the theoretical values of the phase contrast and the experimental thermal measurements is possible since any location on the specimen becomes a sound-free area. TNDE data inversion from simple parameters thus becomes possible also. - Objective #3: HQP (Highly Qualified Personnel) training and development is included. Collaboration with our Colombian partner is essential due to its expertise. A partner from Spain with appropriate expertise for the proposal is also included. Our mutual collaboration is synergistic.","Manufacturing processes and products","Manufacturing processes and products","G�nie �lectrique et g�nie informatique","Maldague, Xavier","SROIA ",Manufacturing,"Industrial engineering","G�nie industriel",1-3
"In Thermal Non Destructive Evaluation (TNDE) of materials, an external thermal stimulation is brought to the component to be inspected and response to this stimulus, recorded with an infrared camera, allows to determine the subsurface structure of this component revealing the presence of potential subsurface defects such as voids, delaminations, porosities. Many problems arise in TNDE either at the stimulation stage or at the signal recording and interpretation stage. Objectives of the proposed research program are oriented towards solution of these problems and they are in continuity with long term goals of our research activities. The present proposed research program offers good potential for novel and significant research activities: * Stimulation/recording stages: The objectives are to study in depth, through thermal modeling and experiments the effects of various inspection stimulation procedures (optical heating, inductive - eddy current - heating, ultrasonic heating) while developing adaptive heating by modifying the spectral content of the launched thermal waves in the component to maximize defect visibility. * Interpretation stage: The objectives consist to pursue development of the pulsed phase thermography (PPT), in which a frequency analysis enables to compute phase images less affected by noise and allowing deeper probing. A proposed enhancement to PPT is the use of the Wavelet transform maintaining access to the time information necessary to extract quantitative information of subsurface artifacts of interest. * Automatic/aided diagnosis: to improve reliability and to facilitate industrial implementation, fusion of eddy current data and thermoinductive heating and the use of ""skewness"" in infrared image processing combined to automatic detection are proposed. Graduate students will be strongly involved in the work presented here which is promising since it will bring fresh ideas to the TNDE community and industrial users. The significance of the proposed activities is two-fold. The basis of the work has a strong theoretical foundation, while results of the proposed program are well applied for instance in industries in order to ensure valuable transfer.","Manufacturing processes and products","Manufacturing processes and products","G�nie �lectrique et g�nie informatique","Maldague, Xavier","RGPIN ","Computer vision",Robotics,Robotique,1-5

"Marine phytoplankton, unicellular algae, have a major impact on the global carbon cycle-and hence climate-by fixing atmospheric carbon dioxide to organic carbon.  A significant fraction of this organic C is transported to the deep ocean via the so-called 'biological pump'.  The ocean's capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide today is lower than during the last ice-ages, as phytoplankton growth is limited by inadequate Fe supply in 30% of the ocean.  Despite chronic Fe limitation in vast oceanic regions, some phytoplankton species are abundant in these waters, while others maintain low 'seed' populations which can respond vigorously to sporadic Fe inputs.  It is thus clear that different phytoplankton have distinct strategies to acquire and store Fe, and may have the ability to substitute Fe for a more abundant trace element.  These different physiological adaptations have important ecological implications during periods of extensive Fe starvation or sporadic Fe inputs.  To improve our understanding of the carbon cycle, it is imperative to investigate the role of trace metals and pCO2 in controlling marine productivity and ecology.  Our research groups, through laboratory and field studies, investigate the physiological adaptations of marine phytoplankton to light-mediated oxidative stress, variable carbon dioxide concentrations, and limiting trace metals concentrations by determining the rates of various metabolic processes, and examining the expression of genes and proteins involved in photosynthesis, C acquisition/fixation and trace metal acquisition/metabolism/storage.  Our research approach consists of a) elucidating phytoplankton physiological responses under tightly controlled laboratory culture conditions and b) examining whether these responses operate at sea.  Our research depends critically on environmental growth chambers for culturing phytoplankton under well controlled temperature and light regimes.  This proposal requests funds for a new, state of the art, culturing chamber to support our laboratory research program.

Laboratory and field studies will elucidate trace metal metabolism and transport in marine phytoplankton.  We hope to provide new insights into how marine phytoplankton subsist under conditions of extreme iron deficiency and how individual metals (e.g. Fe, Cu, Cd) may act synergistically and antagonistically to affect oceanic primary productivity and phytoplankton species assemblage composition.","Oceans, seas and estuaries",Environment,"Earth and Ocean Sciences","Maldonado, Maria","RGPIN ","Nutrition and metabolism, photosynthesis","Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",2-5

"The primary thrust of the reserach proposal is the development of real-time digital control and protection schemes for improved performance and stability of electric power systems. It includes the development of improved techniques for machine parameter estimation, study of specific problems relating to machine behaviour and the analysis, design and development of control and protection schemes. 

A common cause of system performance degradation using fixed parameter controllers is that the power system characteristics change with time and the original contoller parameters are no longer suitable. A solution to this is to monitor the dynamic behaviour of the system in real-time and automatically adjust the controller parameteres on-line. Adaptive control algorithms, particularly suitable for application to electric generating units, that adjust controller parameters automatically to suit actual system conditions are being developed. Adaptive power system stabilzers based on a self-tuning algorithm using a newly developed self-adjusting variable pole-shift control technique have been installed in hydro and nuclear generating stations after extensive laboratory and field tests. Use of optimal control theory, fuzzy logic and neural networks to design adaptive self-tuning controllers that are robust, effective and universal is being investigated for application in renewable, such as wind power, generation schemes.

Use of correct prameters is essential for all system studies. Unobtrusive techniques to determine synchronous machine parameters using measurements taken during normal operation is being investigated. 

A novel hybrid travelling wave and boundary protection scheme for HVDC lines is being investigated. Application of the impedance algorothim, commonly used in protecting transmission lines, is being extended to the protection of transformers. Performance of transmission line differential protection using Wi-Fi protocol for wirless data transmission is being explored. This will obviate the need for land connection between the two ends of the line for transmission of data.

"The immune system is designed to control infectious disease and it is therefore reasonable to expect that high immune responders will have health advantages compared to low responders. Food-producing animals with enhanced immune responses (IR) should have reduced risk of disease, require less therapeutic intervention, including antibiotics, thereby producing milk and meat of improved quality. Previous research at the University of Guelph now allows dairy cows and calves to be classified as high, average or low immune responders using a patented test system. In order to provide protection against diverse pathogens, adaptive immunity includes two components, antibody (AMIR) and cell-mediated immune responses (CMIR). Studies in 2 research herds and a set of commercial herds show that high responders have lower risk of disease. Heritability of AMIR and CMIR are ~ 0.25 indicating that it is possible to improve these traits via genetic selection. Ongoing research is focused on learning more about the molecules, genes and DNA structural differences (epigenetic effects) that influence these unique and important phenotypes. Additionally, there is great deal more to learn about applying

IR phenotyping to the dairy herds before this technology could be broadly adopted by the industry. The first objective proposed here is to evaluate DNA collected from a large number of cows & calves during previous and ongoing studies in order to look in more detail at the genetic processes that control high & low IR. The second objective, given the beneficial associations seen between high IR and disease risk, including mastitis (2x less risk), ketosis (3x less risk), and retained fetal membranes (7x less risk) in a large US herd, is to IR test a set of bulls to determine our ability to improve immunity of sires. The third objective is to beta-test the high and low phenotyping method in a group of 4 commercial herds in Southwestern Ontario. This research has the potential to enhance overall immunity and improve disease resistance of Canadian dairy cattle. In the future, this approach may be applied more broadly to other food-producing species.","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)","Agriculture and primary food production",Pathobiology,"Mallard, Bonnie","CRDPJ ","Animal biology","Animal biology","Biologie animale",1-3

"The present application seeks funding for equipment to support NSERC-funded research on the behavioural pharmacology of cannabinoids. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in Canada and many other nations. Robust, often fiery, debate continues concerning the adverse consequences of cannabis use, as policy makers and the public grapple with issues of cannabis decriminalization and the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Fortunately for this debate, basic research on cannabis continues to evolve. We now know that cannabis and cannabis-like drugs (cannabinoids) produce their mind-altering effects by binding to and activating cannabinoid CB1 receptors, which are numerous and widespread in many brain regions. Another important recent finding was the discovery of endocannabinoids in the brain. These small lipid molecules play a critical role in information storage, movement, appetite, and the perception of pain. Endocannabinoid signaling has been linked to the development of schizophrenia, and in the development of addiction to non-cannabinoid drugs, such as alcohol and heroin. The present proposal seeks funds to purchase operant behaviour test equipment for experiments designed to elucidate the neural mechanisms by which endocannabinoids influence the development of drug addiction via the regulation of neuronal retrograde signaling. Information gained from this research will serve to inform medical and scientific communities, government policy makers, as well as the broader Canadian community about various key issues surrounding drug addiction, and on the critical role of the recently discovered endocannabinoid system.

"Logging and fire in the nutrient poor black spruce-Kalmia forest of eastern Canada often leads to extensive ericaceous heath formation, which interferes with conifer regeneration. Not enough is known about the duration and dynamics of the ericaceous heath. Some suggest it lasts for several years to several decades others suggest alternate stable states based on tree ring and paleocological evidence. This understanding is critical in sustainable forest management and conservation. Failure or delay in conifer regeneration translates into loss of forest productivity and transformation of multi-layered forest to simplified low growing heathland. Limited areas of Kalmia heath in the US is reported to harbor disproportionately large number of rare species. Kalmia heath as a habitat for rare species has not been tested in Canada. The long-term goal of my research program is to understand the habitat and plant community response to forest disturbance particularly the interactions between the dominant understory and canopy species. I frame my applied research questions into contemporary broader ecological concepts. In the next five years I shall concentrate on four short-term objectives: 1) to test the biophysical property of post-fire seedbed and their habitat filtering thresholds, 2) to determine if post-fire Kalmia heath has distinct growth phases with characteristic species composition including rare plants, 3) to determine the population biology of Kalmia and longevity of Kalmia heath, and 4) to test plant-soil feedback effects of Kalmia and even-aged black spruce on community structure. This research will discover the significance of seedbed filter and priority effect on secondary succession in the boreal forest with ericaceous understory. It will create new knowledge on longevity of Kalmia heath which has significant land management implications in eastern Canada.

"String theory is currently the leading candidate for a theory of quantum gravity.  It promises to unify the fundamental forces of particle physics - which are governed by the rules of quantum mechanics - with the force of gravity, as described by Einstein's general theory of relativity.  String theory has the potential to shed light on many basic conceptual questions concerning the fundamental physics of space and time. My research program investigates applications of string theory to two of the most exciting and important such questions.



The first such question involves black holes, which provide an ideal theoretical laboratory for the study of quantum gravity.  Many important puzzles, such as the meaning of the singularity at the core of a black hole, can only be addressed using the tools and techniques of string theory. In doing so, we are forced to reconsider many of our intuitive notions of space and time as smooth, classical objects.



The second set of questions is motivated by recent astronomical observations indicating that the universe began with a big bang singularity followed by a period of rapid expansion.  Neither of these two features - the cosmological singularity and the exponentially expanding phase - have been successfully described in string theory. These problems, which must be solved if string theory is to successfully describe the observable universe, also provide the exciting prospect of contact with experimental data.



This proposed research program will lead to insights spanning several different subfields, ranging from mathematical physics to cosmology, quantum gravity and elementary particle physics, which are crucial to the the study of theoretical physics in Canada.

"All current evidence points to the Standard Model of particle physics as the correct basic theory needed to successfully describe all low-energy phenomena in the universe. In the model, the strong interactions (responsible, for example, for binding neutrons and protons into atomic nuclei) are described using Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), while the weak and electromagnetic interactions are described using the unified electroweak theory of Glashow, Weinberg and Salam. Understanding the precise implications of the Standard Model, at low energies, for systems which feel the strong interactions (hadrons) turns out to be a difficult task, for technical reasons associated with the strength of the strong interaction at these scales. Such strong interactions complicate technical calculations for all processes involving hadrons. This is true not only for those processes mediated by the strong interaction, but also for those mediated by weak and electromagnetic interactions since the latter are altered in a non-trivial way by the strong force through quantum corrections. In this proposal a number of techniques (including ""QCD sum rules"", ""Chiral Perturbation Theory"" and ""lattice gauge theory"") will be employed to (i) produce quantitative predictions for hadronic processes and properties, and (ii) allow precision determinations of a number of the basic parameters of the Standard Model, which represent the fundamental observables for low-energy phenomena occuring in the universe.

"The properties of materials depend both on the nature of the molecules, and on the way these molecules are organized and interact with one another.  The field of supramolecular chemistry uses specific attractive forces between molecules to control the intermolecular interactions and build assemblies of molecules.  These attractive forces are not as strong as chemical bonds, so the assemblies are often easily disrupted.  A newly emerging strategy for making new materials, known as dynamic covalent chemistry, replaces the attractive forces between molecules with special chemical bonds to form large molecular assemblies.  These chemical bonds are strong, but can be reversed so that the links between individual components can disassemble and reassemble to form the most stable arrangement.  The reversibility of the bond formation helps to control the molecular organization and makes dynamic materials that can be changed when new molecules are added or when the chemical environment is changed.



This research program plans to exploit this reversible covalent assembly to make new types of materials and control their properties.  Specifically, the principles of reversible covalent assembly will be applied to the preparation new types of liquid crystals that can be used in liquid crystal displays (LCDs) or photovoltaic solar cells.  The research program will also focus on applying this approach to make rigid, three-dimensional molecular networks that have tiny pores that can soak up small molecules like sponges.  These porous materials could be used as media for hydrogen storage in vehicles, or could be designed to catalyze certain types of chemical reactions.

"Knee osteoarthritis causes chronic pain, limits mobility and reduces quality of life for thousands of Canadians.  This burden is compounded by healthcare costs - over $4.4 billion is spent every year in Canada to manage knee osteoarthritis.  The loads placed on the knee during daily activities are critical in triggering and facilitating knee arthritis.  However, we know very little about how fatigue induced by daily activities contributes to this loading environment.  This research program evaluates the influence of fatigue on the loads placed on the knee.



First, laboratory measures of muscle activity and knee joint loads that occur during walking, both before and after fatigue is induced, will be integrated into a computerized model of the knee.   Second, the research will investigate the factors leading to fatigue.  Measures of the magnitude and repetition of knee joint loads that occur during every day activity in people with knee arthritis will be studied.  To identify magnitude, the loads a person places on their knees during walking will be measured in a laboratory.  To identify repetition, a device like a pedometer will be used to count a person's activities over one week.  Lastly, the influence of psychological factors related to fatigue on mobility performance will be investigated.  A person's confidence in completing physical tasks heavily influences their mobility performance.  The relationships between muscle activity, repetitive loads and psychology will be combined with measures of knee alignment (through advanced imaging), obesity, muscle strength, mobility and pain. 



Because the loads occurring at the knee joint are critical factors in arthritis initiation and progression, understanding the factors that influence the knee joint loading environment, such as fatigue, is very important to advancing care for the thousands of Canadians with arthritis.

"My research program comprises of related projects investigating issues on the dynamic modelling of market variables, which is a fundamental concern in financial valuation, risk management and asset allocation. These projects can be grouped into two general categories. The first category of projects considers the use of financial models that incoporate the shift of economic regimes assumed to follow a hidden Markov model. Under this framework, it is desired to (i) obtain numerical approximation for the fair price of financial contracts by solving a system of partial or ordinary differential equations, (ii) value insurance and pension-related products where both mortality and interest rates have stochastic evolution not necessarily independent of each other and (iii) employ Esscher transform or construct other risk-neutral measures to perform valuation in the incomplete setting of a Markov market.  



The second category of projects deals with the use of financial models where the switching of economic regimes is modulated by a hidden weak Markov chain in either discrete or continuous time. Weak Markov chains are capable of capturing the dynamics of financial processes with memory. Under this formulation, (i) the theory of stochastic filtering will be adopted to estimate model parameters; (ii) estimated parameters will then be used to price financial derivatives, calculate risk measures and design an optimal allocation of assets; and (iii) several important statistical inference questions will be addressed.  



Resolving the aforementioned issues would enable financial institutions to quantify and manage their risk profile accordingly and provide impetus to other researchers in the analysis of related problems in finance. This research work will be instrumental in the attainment of an efficient, well-functioning and stable financial market.

"The fields of visual Multimedia and Medical Imaging are continually evolving. During the past 1-2 decades, there has been a significant increase in the level of interest in designing efficient image analysis systems for multimedia and medical applications. Many new application areas, such as the Computer aided diagnostic systems, Image Visualization, Content-based Image and Video Retrieval, Multimedia Communications, Image and Video Databases, World Wide Web, are feasible with the current technology. However, as new applications are coming up, new requirements are being specified, and a substantial amount of work remains to be accomplished in this area.

The proposed research focuses on the development of novel image analysis systems for multimedia and medical applications. The main objectives of the proposed research are to explore superior techniques related to the following two complementary areas:

1. Super Resolution Imaging and Visualization: We will focus on designing efficient low complexity techniques for generating high resolution videos by combining information from several low resolution videos. The developed techniques will be useful in areas such as Medical Data Visualization, Sports Training, Event Modeling, and High Definition Video Generation.

2. Image Analysis and Feature Detection using Stochastic Resonance: We will develop efficient image analysis techniques using the recently discovered stochastic resonance phenomenon. Both theoretical development of stochastic resonance and its application in signal and image processing will be considered. These techniques will be very useful for image analysis in a noisy environment. Three applications will be considered: The fault detection in a Gearbox (industrial testing and monitoring), Detection of lesions/tumors in MRI brain images (health application), and Digital watermarking (consumer imaging application).

"A fundamental requirement of human rationality is that judgments be internally consistent and logically coherent. Studies of systematic violations of coherence have revealed much about the cognitive processes underlying judgment, and tests of coherence are of pragmatic value given that they can offer important indications of judgment quality. The overarching objective of this research program is to develop a comprehensive theoretical account of the cognitive processes underlying probability judgment and more complex types of judgment that require the integration of frequency or probability information, such as judgments of contingency and probable causation. The proposed research, which will be comprised of 11 core experiments, will directly build upon recent theoretical developments in cognitive psychology that address the nature of judgment processes. One set of experiments will provide critical tests of recent theories that make specific predictions regarding how information is mentally represented and how such representations, in turn, are used as inputs into assessment processes, which proximally determine judgment responses. A second set of experiments will examine whether systematic violations of coherence in judgment that have been documented in tasks in which all of the relevant information is explicitly described in text are similarly manifested in tasks in which the same information must be acquired through exposure to individual cases presented on a trial-by-trial basis. The final set of experiments will examine whether more complex types of judgment, including causal and non-causal contingency judgments, also exhibit systematic violations of coherence criteria. In particular, these experiments will examine how the formulation of a hypothesis about an inter-event relation influences the manner in which information pertinent to contingency judgment is integrated. The proposed research will draw upon multiple experimental methods and include measures of judgment, belief, response time, representation, and assessment processes. The research findings will be disseminated in peer-review, cognitive psychology journals and at scientific conferences on judgment and reasoning.

"The proposed research encompasses four distinct areas: 1) the introduction of low-injection photo-carrier radiometry (PCR) to monitor heavy metal contamination (Fe, Cu) in semiconductor silicon with a near infrared photomultiplier instead of an InGaAs photodiode. Low-injection conditions are crucial for assessing the electronic quality of photonic and microelectronic semiconductor devices under realistic industrial operating conditions.  2) Fourier-domain biomedical depth selective photoacoustic tomographic (FD-PAT) imaging of cancerous lesions in soft tissues using specialty piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer arrays. When fully developed, this technology has the potential to deliver ultrasonic-quality image resolution, and to provide contrast between healthy and cancerous tissues rivaling that of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a fraction of the cost. 3) The introduction of a potentially breakthrough biothermophotonic technique leading to the development of a sensitive noninvasive, non-contact device for blood glucose monitoring in diabetic patients. 4) The development of a combined photothermal radiometric (PTR) and modulated luminescence (LUM) dynamic lock-in imaging technique for real-time assessment of very early dental carious lesions. Two cameras will be used to capture dynamic lock-in images of LUM (near-IR camera) and of PTR (thermal-IR camera). The success of this dental imaging project may lead to a breakthrough safe dental clinical imaging technology to compete with ionizing X-radiographs in clinical settings.  The proposed research program is aimed at (1) boosting Canadian competitiveness in industrial electronic device and materials processing through improved quality control; (2) developing breakthrough techniques and biosensor instrumentation for the earliest possible detection of diseases such as breast cancerous lesions, diabetes and dental demineralization caries which will benefit all Canadians; and (3) offering advanced training of HQP in multidisciplinary problems in key industrial and health sector areas in which Canada has an active presence and must continue competing internationally, or in new growth fields in which it should find opportunities to compete.

"The proposed research project is aimed at the development of a novel photoacoustic, PA (or photothermoacoustic, PTA) imaging technology to address the important issue of the earliest possible non-invasive detection of breast cancer. The hallmark of growing breast cancer is uncontrolled proliferation of capillary blood vessels (angiogenesis), which can be identified by the optical characteristics of blood haemoglobin. Laser photoacoustics takes advantage of the optical contrast between cancerous and normal tissues to enable non-invasive breast imaging. The novel frequency-domain (FD-PTA) method is based on radar (or sonar) principles. Distinctive features of the proposed PTA imaging include: 1) high signal-to-noise ratio which allows one to reduce power of laser irradiation to levels acceptable to Health Canada and FDA; 2) submillimeter axial position, achieved by signal compression applied to the PA response to a laser modulation chirp (frequency sweep); 3) depth information, mapped into the spectrum of PA signals; 4) higher depth resolution than the conventional pulsed-laser alternative as a result of efficient suppression of baseline interference; and 5) phase information, which can be used for depth-resolved imaging in addition to the amplitude image. This is a highly original concept in biomedical imaging, which has no known precedent of practical implementation in a diagnostic instrument used for real-life clinical applications. In comparison to X-ray mammography, the proposed development of PHotoAcoustic Scanning Tomography (PHAST) provides several important advantages: 1) use of non-ionizing radiation; 2) superior sensitivity based on optical contrast, which is not available in mammography; 3) Compact and portable design due to the use of inexpensive

low-power laser diodes; 4) Comfort: no breast compression is needed; 5) Simplicity in operation and image interpretation.","Biomedical engineering","Health, education and social services","Mechanical and Industrial Engineering","Mandelis, Andreas","STPGP ","Biomedical technology","Biomedical engineering","G�nie biom�dical",1-3
"Diabetes mellitus afflicts a large and growing number of people worldwide - over 2 million in Canada alone costing the health care system over $13.2 billion/year. To manage this condition, and to reduce the risk of severe long term health complications, patients check blood sugar levels up to five times a day to maintain physiological glucose concentration between 90 and 120 mg/dl. The standard technique for measurement of glucose concentration requires skin puncture to draw a small blood sample which can be examined using a test strip and automated meter to report results. Although this technique provides accurate glucose concentration data, frequent skin puncture is associated with significant discomfort, pain and risk of infection. Despite significant effort directed towards development of noninvasive and minimally-invasive techniques for glucose monitoring over the past twenty years, no completely noninvasive sensor is available at the moment. The proposed biothermophotonic technique relies on recent advances in infrared (IR) quantum cascade laser and non-cryogenic IR detector developments, the judicious choice of differential absorption in tissue in the 9-10.5 um glucose absorption band and detection of photothermal blackbody emission photons in the mid-IR spectral band away from the absorption region. The differential thermal-wave signal can be related to glucose concentration in the tissue specimen (A. Mandelis and S. Telenkov, US patent pending). This technique may be applied for measurements of glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid of the superficial skin layers to establish correlation with glucose concentration in the blood. Since it measures only a differential signal it stands a chance to become an absolute measure of glucose concentration. We envision the development of a portable, relatively inexpensive instrument with two small low-power out-of-phase-current-modulated quantum cascade laser sources providing wavelength modulation, IR delivery and collection fiber optics or hollow waveguides, signal processing and control unit, and a suitable body-part rest unit for laser beam exposure. The outcome of this research will place Canada on the map of noninvasive glucose biosensor technology.","Not available","Not available","Mechanical and Industrial Engineering","Mandelis, Andreas","CHRPJ ","Life sciences research related to human health and disease","Life sciences research related to human health and disease","Sciences de la vie li�es � la sant� publique et aux maladies humaines",2-3

"Attachment of a foreign substance (xenobiotic) to DNA to form a covalent DNA adduct (addition product) may induce mutations causing cancer formation, or facilitate cell death and block or reverse the carcinogenic process.  A number of natural products and chemical carcinogens are known to undergo metabolism to form reactive radical species that attach covalently to the C8-site of purine (deoxyguanosine (dG) and deoxyadenosine (dA)) bases to form C8-aryl(Ar)-purine adducts.  While C8-Ar-purine adducts are expected to initiate mutations, cancer formation and cell death, very little is known about their chemical and biochemical properties.  This lack of knowledge limits our ability to predict how these adducts will contribute to human disease.  Thus, the goal of this NSERC-funded project is to fill this gap in our understanding of the consequences of C8-Ar-purine adduct formation.  In this phase of our research program we characterize their impact on duplex DNA structure, DNA replication and begin to assess their chemical reactivity. We have established synthetic strategies for the site-specific incorporation of C8-Ar-purine adducts into DNA.   Optical spectroscopies are utilized to determine their impact on duplex DNA stability and structure.  Included in this aspect of the project is the use of C8-Ar-purine adducts as molecular sensors and as redox-active nucleobases that act as preferential targets of further oxidation within duplex DNA.  Primer extension studies utilizing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with DNA polymerases to measure insertion of nucleotides opposite a C8-Ar-purine adduct and chain extension from the 3'-terminus are also proposed.   As the replication of adduct-modified DNA involves DNA polymerases, these studies will begin to assess the biological impact of C8-Ar-purine adducts, which will be of broad scientific value to researchers in chemistry, biology and medicine.

"Despite progress in graphics capabilities and processing power, current interactive applications still have considerable usability problems. One main reason for these problems is that applications do not understand or adapt to users' context, such as their location, situation, expertise, or emotional state. As a result, applications often act inappropriately: they provide inappropriate feedback, interrupt the user at the wrong time, increase frustration, and overwhelm the user with unsuitable information. 



In order to solve these problems, we must make significant advances in two key areas: first, a set of mechanisms for gathering, interpreting, and modeling user context; and second, a set of techniques and strategies for adapting user interfaces and system behaviour based on contextual information. 



My research program investigates three main themes in sensing user context and adapting user interfaces. The first theme will focus on the detection and modeling of user emotional state when engaged with interactive technologies. The second theme will focus on the detection of user expertise and the provision of intelligent help based on this information. The final theme will focus on the detection of cognitive interruptibility, and the subsequent treatment of interrupting notifications in computer interfaces. Contributions will be made in the areas of user modeling, interface design, intelligent and adaptive interfaces, affective computing, and context-awareness.

"Wood is becoming an increasingly valuable source of energy due to high fossil fuel prices, the need to reduce fossil fuel emissions, ongoing conflicts in major oil producing states, and negative effects of agriculture-based bioenergy solutions on food production. At the same time, there is a large scale mountain pine beetle epidemic in British Columbia and Alberta that could threaten the boreal forest as well. Many policy analysts have suggested salvaging these affected areas for wood energy.

The principal objective of this research is to quantify the climate mitigation potential of three forest-based bioenergy projects and to assess the conditions under which these projects are cost-effective. A secondary objective is to develop scientifically sound methods for establishing a carbon baseline and calculating the appropriate carbon credit for such wood energy projects in the future.

This will be done by constructing an agent-based simulation model of the current wood and forest product flows within an industrial timber supply area in the northern interior region of British Columbia that has been heavily affected by the ongoing mountain pine beetle epidemic. Bioenergy production has the potential to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels, to reduce negative price effects for roundwood by shifting salvaged roundwood into alternative markets, and to extend the time window when salvage harvesting is economically feasible.

This project will enable stakeholders and decision makers to systematically evaluate the economic and carbon budget implications of introducing bioenergy production as an alternative or complement to fibre utilization for conventional forest products. Linking forest inventories, management planning, manufacturing, and product demand within a single modeling framework will make it possible to rapidly and cost-effectively assess business opportunities and to identify areas where regulatory changes could enhance the economic viability and resilience of communities affected by the mountain pine beetle epidemic.

"Ichnology involves the study of biogenic structures that result from the interactions between organisms and the substrate. Comparisons of ichnofaunas through geologic time reveal a complex interplay of ecologic and evolutionary controls. The different tracemakers and their specific responses to environmental changes reflect long-term macroevolutionary processes. Although ecologic controls have been the focus of ichnologic research, evolutionary aspects have been less explored. In particular, archetypal ichnofacies (distinctive suites of trace fossils), albeit recurrent in space and time, reflect changes through geologic time as a result of paleoecologic breakthroughs. The aim of this project is: (1) to compare marine ichnofacies through geologic time in terms of taxonomic composition, ecologic significance, and potential tracemakers, and (2) to discuss how faunal turnovers, degree of infaunalization, and colonization histories change the nature of archetypal ichnofacies during the Phanerozoic. The activities planned include: (1) fieldwork in several marine successions of different age, and (2) construction of a database of marine ichnofacies. To a lesser extent, the project will involve revision of trace fossil collections as supplementary information. Ichnologic information has been obtained from a number of stratigraphic units, spanning the Cambrian to the Neogene. These include the early Paleozoic of Argentina, Bolivia, Canada and Jordan, the late Paleozoic of Argentina, Brazil, England and United States, the Mesozoic of Argentina, Australia, Romania and United States, and the Cenozoic of  Argentina, Chile, Venezuela and Romania. Additional fieldwork is focused on both critical intervals from a macroevolutionary perspective (Cambrian, Ordovician) and times with sparse ichnologic information (e.g. Devonian, Paleogene) . The database will be constructed based on critical examination of the literature, trace fossil specimens and field data. The database will include ichnotaxonomic composition, preservation styles, ethology, feeding strategies, tiering structure, ichnoguild assessment, age, and depositional environment.","Earth sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Geological Sciences","Mangano, MariaGabriela","RGPIN ","Paleontology, paleobiology","Earth science","Sciences de la terre",2-5

"The cryopreservation of bull semen represents one of the most important achievements in dairy farming after the introduction of artificial insemination.  These two approaches have enabled the worldwide distribution and use of desired genetic lines at a reasonable cost.  Canada represents <3% of the global economy but provides >20% of world bovine semen exports (~70 million dollars/annum).  Egg yolk (EY) and skimmed milk are the most used protective agents to freeze mammalian sperm.  EY and milk, being products of animal origin, represent a potential risk of contamination of semen and moreover, their composition is not uniform.  Thus, there is an urgent need of developing novel media free of products from animal origin to conserve semen.  However, it is difficult to find replacement component for EY or milk because the mechanisms involved in sperm protection by EY and milk against cooling, freezing and storage damages remains unclear.  Over the past six years we provided evidences, which indicate that the sperm protection by EY involves an association of EY low-density lipoproteins (LDL) with seminal plasma proteins that are detrimental to sperm storage.  These detrimental proteins originally discovered in bovine seminal plasma (hence BSP proteins) have the potential to extract lipids from the sperm membrane thereby adversely affecting the ability of sperm to be preserved.    However, when these BSP proteins are associated with LDL, they lose their ability to extract lipid from the sperm membrane, which is the origin for sperm protection (novel concept).  Interestingly, skimmed milk, which does not contain lipoproteins, also protects sperm during storage.  Thus we hypothesize that the casein micelles and whey proteins, which are the major components of milk bind to BSP proteins and this interaction is the key for sperm protection.  The current program is aimed at understanding of the mechanisms involved in sperm protection by egg yolk and milk, which would help us to develop novel extenders for commercial application that do not contain animal products.

Our work has provided new insight into the mechanism of sperm protection by EY. We showed that seminal vesicles of all ungulates studied to

date (bull, boar, stallion, bison, goat, ram) secrete in abundant quantity, a family of choline phospholipid-binding proteins, named Binder of Sperm (BSP). These BSP proteins, which are added to sperm at ejaculation, are detrimental to sperm since they extract lipids from the sperm membrane thereby adversely affecting the ability of sperm to be preserved. Interestingly, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) found in EY extenders, bind BSP proteins and this interaction inhibits or minimizes the detrimental effect of BSP proteins on sperm and consequently, sperm is protected. The current program is aimed at developing solutions (extenders) suitable to preserve sperm properties during preserving or cryopreserving sperm samples, which are suitable for use in clinical and/or diagnostic research, sorting sexed semen and artificial insemination application.","Animal management (animal diseases, breeding)","Agriculture and primary food production","M�decine","Manjunath, Puttaswamy","I2IPJ ","Animal reproduction","Animal biology","Biologie animale","1 & 2-2"

In recent years, there have been numerous devices based on global positioning system (GPS) technology beginning with ""lightbar"" navigation aids (that displayed supplemental navigation information for the driver).  Currently, auto-steer systems (that make steering corrections for the driver) are becoming common on Canadian farms.  It seems to be inevitable that increasingly-sophisticated navigation devices will be available to farmers.  The current trend is towards semi-autonomous and autonomous agricultural vehicles.  This rapid change in technology has changed the role to be played by the operator of an agricultural vehicle.

"The main objective of this research is to investigate and develop intelligent control and navigational architectures for mobile robots to operate autonomously and cooperatively with humans and other mobile agents in applications where the operational environment is dynamic and subjected to changing conditions. Industrial application includes open-pit mining, agriculture, forestry, service robots, highway maintenance and construction, where robots are required to deal with dynamic and changing environments during operations. Fully automated and intelligent robot navigation would allow better utilization of time and resources resulting in higher productivity for many industrial applications. The machineries (or mobile equipment) operating under dynamic conditions generally require skilled operators and in most cases they work in complex environments where the surroundings are subjected to unexpected changes. This research aims at developing control and navigational techniques that are relevant for autonomous operation of multi-agent systems. 

The proposal includes several main research components; high-level control of behaviour coordination and navigation of robots in unstructured environments; modelling of environmental dynamics and moving objects using multiple sensory data; human robot interactions (HRI); and multi-variable and intelligent predictive low-level control of robotic systems. The issues are addressed at perceptual and action (control) levels of the robotic system.

Fuzzy reasoning has shown significant improvements to both low-level and high-level control. Behaviour modulation using fuzzy context blending or modelling of a behavioural state using fuzzy discrete event systems has shown significant improvements in robotic control. Therefore, in this research, fuzzy logic based reasoning systems are used for control, navigation and predictive control.

"The objectives for this Discovery Grant research program are all related to understanding energy transport in a region of near-Earth space called the magnetosphere. Specifically, the research will address two of the most important outstanding questions in space physics: the acceleration of so-called satellite ""killer"" electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts to significant fractions of the speed of light, and the explosive release of energy in the magnetospheric substorm. The question of what accelerates electrons to speeds close to the speed of light remains unanswered since the accidental discovery of this radiation by James Van Allen with Explorer 1 nearly 50 years ago. This question also has broader astrophysical importance as a fundamental particle acceleration process in the universe, as well as technological importance since a number of satellite failures and anomalies are linked to discharging triggered by this radiation. Indeed, this is a high priority for the International Living With A Star (ILWS) program in which Canada is an active participant. This Discovery Grant will also enable the ground-based monitoring of the processes following the explosive release of energy in a substorm, the process responsible for creating the most spectacular displays of the northern lights. Our research program will target the characterization of the energy transport in unprecedented detail using data from ground-based magnetometers in the CARISMA array (the proposer is the PI). Supporting data from ground-based optical, radar and GPS instruments in the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) funded Canadian Geospace Monitoring program, as well as analysis of data from the recently launched five satellite THEMIS mission (the proposer is a Co-Investigator) and other satellite platforms, will also be key. The proposed research program also has important synergy with science targets for forthcoming satellite missions including the CSA e-POP (enhanced Polar Outflow Probe) small satellite mission, due for launch in 2008, for the ESA SWARM mission (launch 2010), and for the approved NASA Radiation Belt Storm Probes (the proposer is a Co-I) and the proposed CSA ORBITALS (the proposer is the PI) missions which will target the Van Allen belts around 2011-12.","Space and astronomy","Advancement of knowledge",Physics,"Mann, Ian","RGPIN ","Space plasmas","Space science","Recherche spatiale",2-5

"In a parametric solid modeling package such as SolidWorks, the idea of design intent is that the design should reflect the user's intent. Part of this is a requirement on the design process. As a simple example, if the desired object has mirror symmetry such as a car body, the user should design one half the object and then reflect this half object to obtain the other half. The benefit is that if the user later changes details on the object (such as changing the style of headlights in this car example), the change only needs to be made to one headlight rather than to two. But a modeling system should also try to infer what the user is trying to design. For example, if the user draws a straight line and extrudes it, the user most likely desires the extrusion to be a plane.



In this proposal, I will investigate how design intent applies to surfaces. Surfaces are often designed by the user sketching boundary curves and then requesting that the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) package fill in the interior of a surface patch.  While this is an under-constrained problem, additional constraints can be inferred from design intent: if opposing boundary curves each have a single peak, then an interior slice of the surface should also have a single peak.  The goal of this project is to identify surface design intent, find corresponding geometric constraints, and construct surfaces that obey these constraints.



The significance of this work is that it will ease the design task for users of CAD systems. Currently, there is sufficient flexibility in tensor product surfaces that designers can design the surfaces they want. However, after making an initial design with curves and having the CAD system fill in the interior, designers need to spend time adjusting the surface to achieve the shape they wanted when sketching the initial curves. The proposed method attempts to infer what the designer desires when constructing and thus reduce the time required for the second adjustment currently required.

"While modern video surveillance technology has become pervasive, it is often designed for large organizations to monitor individuals, rather than to directly help those individuals help themselves.  The word ""surveillance"" derives from the French words ""sur"", which means ""from above"", and ""veiller"" which means ""to watch"".

   The proposed research is directed at technologies and systems for inverse surveillance, also known in the literature as ""sousveillance"".  The word ""sous"" is French for ""from below"", i.e. ""sousveillance"" means ""to watch from below"".  Whereas surveillance concerns itself with public safety, the focus of the sousveillance research is personal safety, i.e.  body-borne personal safety devices, technology, and systems.  Whereas surveillance typically involves cameras mounted on lamp posts, or ceilings (i.e. watching people from above) the sousveillance research will focus on portable or body-borne (wearable, or implantable) video cameras.

  I will invent, design, and build various human-centered capture devices and systems for:

(1) personal safety, e.g. a wearable version of the ""black box"" flight recorder found on aircraft that will help determine the cause of a slip-and-fall or a hit-and-run of a pedestrian by automobile;

(2) personal health monitoring systems for improved health and well-being;

(3) personal assistive technologies such as wearable cameras with computational seeing aids.

  More specifically, I will build several different kinds of personal capture devices, and I will also look at sousveillance more wholistically by investingating systems and software, i.e. creating various new file formats, networking protocols, system architectures, and software systems for capture, storage, processing, transmission, and retrieval of sousveillance data, as well as continuing to contribute to the growing body of scientific knowledge in this important area.

"Like all plants, trees constantly monitor endogenous and environmental cues, and use this information to make adjustments in resource allocation, both to maximize resource acquisition and to minimize exposure to deleterious phenomena. To accomplish this, trees/plants possess mechanisms that integrate and interpret the information provided by internal and environmental signals. Ultimately, these phenomena are controlled at the level of gene expression, which consequently manifests the accumulation of a variety of soluble metabolites, including carbohydrates. A thorough understanding of the intricacies of the biosynthetic processes governing sucrose biosynthesis (catabolism and anabolism) throughout the life cycle of trees is pivotal to understanding programmed cellular growth patterns, response(s) to environmental cues, the ability to withstand environmental stresses (biotic and abiotic), and the complex network and regulatory frameworks fundamental to the development of cell wall (morphology, ultrastructure and chemistry). This research project will attempt to elucidate the control mechanisms that underpin the synthesis and fate (i.e. allocation and partitioning) of sucrose in trees, specifically Populus.  This objective will be achieved by employing a long-term, mechanistic functional genomics investigation of sucrose metabolism, combining parallel biochemical (metabolite profiling) and molecular (transcriptional regulation) studies aimed at elucidating the key metabolites and genes modulating carbohydrate metabolism.  The complexities (accumulation, degradation, and tissue specific localization) of ""resource allocation"", including sucrose biosynthesis and translocation, the generation of starch (including its mobilization), and the biosynthesis of oligomeric carbohydrates (i.e. raffinose, stachyose) will be investigated in Populus, employing an array of functional genomics techniques coupled with traditional cell wall biochemistry.","Plant production and plant primary products","Agriculture and primary food production","Wood Science","Mansfield, Shawn","RGPIN ","Plant growth and development","Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",3-5

"Our focus is on dominant atmospheric phenomena that require extreme combinations of solar radiation, chemistry and especially dynamics: winds and waves. Objectives include understanding ""stratospheric sudden winter warmings"", when Canadian latitudes above tropopause heights (~15km) are dominated by winds typical of summer months, and chemical distributions are significantly changed; the cold summer middle atmosphere above 60km, at mid-high latitudes, when despite continuous solar heating the atmosphere is so cold that noctilucent clouds form; major oscillations eg. Quasi-Biennial and Arctic, which produce regional changes in weather, but also global changes throughout the atmosphere (up to 100km); and variations in the winter/spring polar vortex (15-100km), which modify the global distributions and 'holes' of ozone. All latitudes including the tropics must be studied due to global coupling. Our approach is to study the waves that are dominant in the above phenomena: tides (driven by solar heating of water vapor and ozone), planetary waves and gravity waves (related to and sourced in weather systems). Observationally we use Medium Frequency Radars to measure the winds (60-100km), including our UofS systems (Institute of Space and Atmospheric Studies) at Saskatoon 52N, Eureka 80N, Tromso 70N (Norway), & Platteville 40N (Colorado); global networks of radars and optical devices operated by international colleagues, with whom I establish collaborations; data from Canadian and International 'satellite systems'; and collaborations using major global atmospheric models.

Our research has high societal-value, as trends in these phenomena have significant impacts on Canada's climate and 'quality of life'. The program is strongly linked with CANDAC-PEARL [Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory, Canadian Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Change], the Canadian Space Agency and also international programs e.g. CAWSES, ""Climate and Weather of the Sun-Earth System"" within SCOSTEP, 2004-08+. The program will lead to richer understanding of the global atmospheric environment and assist nationally and internationally in the understanding of Global Change and its modeling.

"This is a joint Canadian-French proposal submitted in response to the first NSERC-ANR call for proposals announced by NSERC in January 2009.  The participants of this proposal are: the University of Waterloo (Waterloo, Ontario),  CEA-LETI (Grenoble, France), IMEP( Grenoble, France), COM DEV (Cambridge, Ontario) and NovaMEMS (Toulouse, France). The proposal deals with the use of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology to develop and qualify miniature radio frequency (RF) switch matrices for space applications.   The satellite communication industry in Canada is an area of strategic national interest. It is enjoying phenomenal growth with a market that remains fueled by the increased demands for multi-media services. Switches and switch matrices represent a critical and substantive portion of a satellite payload. They are used to provide on-board equipment redundancy and for signal routing. The MEMS technology offers not only a reduction in mass, size and dc power consumption but also the promise of a superior performance to that of the current technologies.  The project encompasses the development of novel RF MEMS switches and switch matrices with a focus on improving reliability for space-based applications. It builds on the strengths of the academic team members in RF engineering and MEMS fabrication and characterization.  The Canadian industrial partner, COM DEV, is the world's largest  supplier of switch matrices for space applications. The French industrial partner, NovaMEMS,  specializes in failure analysis and reliability assessment of micro and nano technologies.  The research team has all the expertise and heritage needed to succeed in this endeavor. We regard this project as critical for showcasing the benefits and viability of the MEMS technology and encouraging satellite prime contractors to adopt this new generation of switch technology in future commercial satellite systems.

"Sulfur-containing functional groups- sulfides, sulfoxides, sulfenes, sulfonamides, sulfonates, etc.- are present in a vast array of biologically and pharmacologically important molecules, including biotin, lipoic acid, methionine, cysteine, taurine, anti-biotic  anti-tumor, anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-asthma, anti-anemia, anti-viral, anti-psychotic, cardiotonic, anti-allergic and anti-migraine agents, as well as treatments for enlargement of the prostate gland and male erectile dysfunction. Included in this list are 14 of the 20 top grossing pharmaceuticals, with total sales of over $40 billion US in 2005 (US sales figures).

Despite the presence of sulfur in all of these noteworthy clinical compounds, methods for installation of sulfur into molecules are far less developed than techniques for installing oxygen or nitrogen. The goal of our research is to develop general, broad scope methods for the construction of sulfur-containing molecules. The long term the success of this research would heavily impact the worlds of medicinal chemistry and drug discovery, leading to new, cheaper and more effective medicines.

"The proposed research models interactions between retailers and consumers by investigating pricing decisions by retailers and purchase decision making by consumers in game-theoretical frameworks. While traditional dynamic pricing literature assumes passive consumers, the proposed research endogenizes consumers' decision making in dynamic pricing, finite horizon, competitive settings. In one setting, the largest consistent set concept will be utilized to search for the set of possibly-stable states, and in another, mixed pricing strategies will be explored. Using these approaches will introduce uncertainty about future prices, as consumers and retailers will not know which of the possible outcomes will be realized. Thus, the impact of consumer decision making on prices and retailers' profits will be analyzed, and the approaches to mitigate strategic consumer behavior will be explored.

In other market settings, interactions between retailers and consumers are enabled by fee-charging platforms in two-sided markets. These are markets which involve two distinct types of end-users, each of whom obtains value from interacting with end-users of the opposite type. Using this framework, the interactions between airlines, airports, and passengers, will be modeled to explore the optimal set of fees charged by capacity-constrained platforms (airports) to the two sides of the market (airlines and passengers), when these fees, which are required for platform operations, could be used to ration current capacity but could also be used for future capacity installations (which implies a two-period setting).

"When people attempt to describe problems they face in remembering, they often claim that they can't ""retrieve"" something. The use of this term is indicative of the dominant theory of human memory: remembering consists of retrieval. In contrast to the retrieval view, recent research in cognitive psychology suggests that people rely on decision rules or ""heuristics"" when making decisions about the past (e.g., Kleider & Goldinger, 2006). To illustrate, suppose a Professor is trying to recall whether the usual ""two meetings per month"" were held with the graduate students during the current month: a memory trace of strong subjective quality may help the Professor decide that both meetings took place. That is because having a memory trace of a strong subjective quality usually means that an event has taken place twice; such a trace can be used inferentially to determine whether a repetition occurred. However, if the Professor's memory trace is of a strong subjective quality for reasons other than repeated behaviour, the subjective quality heuristic will lead to error: the Professor will falsely believe the meeting occurred twice (Kronlund & Whittlesea, 2006). Recently, in an investigation about learning, I provided evidence against two popular retrieval theories (global matching and signal-detection accounts), specified the inference process, and proposed the notion that a ""subjective quality heuristic"" is used when people are faced with making memory decisions involving judgments of prior re-occurrence (Kronlund, 2006). These findings leave important questions about the mechanism involved in other memory-based cognitive tasks. The broad goal of my research program is to identify the mechanisms involved in cognitive tasks including memory decisions and memory-based choice decisions. To achieve this end, I will carry out 3 empirical investigations that use recognition, recall, and memory-based choice tasks. I will test alternative theories to heuristic processing. I expect that my research program will provide an original and innovative contribution to the scientific study of human memory and human decision-making. Given that my findings will impact knowledge in human learning and memory, it will have vast applications to education and marketing.

"Implantation of medical prosthesis made of metallic, polymeric and ceramic materials saves lives and improves quality of life for millions of people around the globe. Improving the biological and clinical performances of these devices features a major impact on quality and cost of health care in Canada and all around the globe. As an example, drug-eluting stents constitute a recent development to improve the quality of life of patients affected by serious cardiac problems, by providing precise, minimally invasive drug delivery. Polymer coatings constitute functional, valid and high potential carriers to locally dispense pharmaceuticals. However, the adhesion of the coating must be studied and optimized. In fact, adhesive and cohesive failures during in situ stent deployment occur, leading to the partial delamination or total separation of the coating which in turn causes a flow perturbation and leads to stenosis or occlusion. Our current research investigates surface modifications and treatments to deposit highly adhesive and strongly cohesive thin (nano) coatings on stents. Plasma reactor technology plays a key role in this discovery studies we carried out in the past five years. In particular, the importance of the oxide layer composition is trivial for the interfacial properties within the coating. Very recently, preliminary results conducted in a plasma-based ion implantation reactor in Germany (one of the very few available worldwide) unequivocally showed that the composition oxide layer composition of metals could be tailored by treatment with specific gases. In particular, we applied an oxygen plasma-based ion implantation treatment on SS316L (the metal mostly used to industrially fabricate stents) was able to successfully change the composition of the oxide layer from the classical chromium-oxide one to a new iron-oxide. This is an extraordinary result and it is susceptible to completely modify the interface of the coating, as well as its adhesion and stability properties, especially in regard to medical applications. Therefore, we propose to NSERC to finance this reactor. It will be the first installed in Canada, and the resulting setup will provide the most performing research on the interfacial properties between advanced nano-coatings and metallic substrates. It will allow researchers i) to access to all the potential available from plasma-based modifications on metallic substrates, ii) to modulate the composition of the oxide layer of metallic substrates; and iii) to tailor the interfacial properties for the benefit of a variety of domains, including the medical one.","Manufacturing processes and products","Manufacturing processes and products","G�nie des mines, m�tallurgie et mat�riaux","Mantovani, Diego","EQPEQ ","Materials science and technology","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",1-1
"The development of specific environments with antibacterial properties is a major challenge for spaces in presence of high-volume human activities. The aim of this project is to develop a specific technological platform for new antibacterial coatings. Many infections are caused by bacteria which are normally present on a variety of surfaces of many different materials (including e.g. tools and furniture used in hospital operating rooms and intensive care units, but also computer keyboards, washroom facilities, and materials covering floors, walls and ceilings). Thus, antibacterial coatings for the prevention of undesired infections find applications in many different industries, ranging from tools for hospitals to surfaces in the food industry to surfaces for space missions. Improving antibacterial coatings is therefore a priority for the manufacturing

sector. Novel techniques allowing sputtering metal coatings as well as bioactive diamond-like (DLC)-based carbon coatings doped with specific metallic ions will be investigated. DLC is well known for its excellent non-toxicity and compatibility toward human-contact applications. These properties can be combined with very good mechanical characteristics and adhesion to a large variety of surfaces, making it the material of choice for high resistance, non-toxic and durable coatings. Doping with metal ions is aimed to provide specific bactericidal response to coated surfaces. Plasma-based techniques permit to grow high quality coatings, allowing to combine the growth of DLC thin films with percentage atomic impurities of elements with

antibacterial properties. This combination will help understand the relative importance of the coating itself on antibacterial properties (in particular its mechanical properties) with respect to various dopants, a result of fundamental value which can be applied to improve other types of biomedical materials.

"This research program combines studies in thyroid hormone physiology, molecular biology and gene regulation to decipher the internal signals that regulate the dramatic developmental event of metamorphosis in lampreys.  Lamprey metamorphosis is analogous to the metamorphosis that transforms a fish-like tadpole into a frog.  Lampreys are one of the most ancient living vertebrates (animals with a spinal column, including humans) and are a good model to study the evolution of developmental regulation and vertebrate ancestry. Interestingly, the start of lamprey metamorphosis coincides with a dramatic drop in thyroid hormone levels. This drop is opposite to the surge in thyroid hormone levels seen at the beginning of major developmental events in other vertebrates. The aims of this research program are to determine if this paradox of lamprey metamorphosis represents a fundamental difference in how thyroid hormones control development in lamprey (i.e. gene regulation) or more simply a difference in the physiological and cellular regulation of active hormone.  Specifically this program will decipher the function and role in development of:  a) systems in lamprey blood that transport thyroid hormones b) the enzymes that activate and inactivate the hormones in the cell and c) the receptors to which hormones bind to modulate gene activity.  Lastly, we will also identify the lamrpey genes that are controlled by thyroid hormones and potentially drive metamorphosis.  My research program will advance our understanding of the regulation of thyroid hormones and their role in the development of ancient vertebrates.  Thyroid hormones are involved in many important biological processes in vertebrates including:  development, growth, fat metabolism, temperature regulation, immune defense and reproduction. The unique nature of the lamprey thyroid system and its role in lamprey development may offer new insights into vertebrate thyroid physiology and dysfunction. Lastly, a better understanding of the factors that control lamprey development will provide novel opportunities to develop environmentally benign measures to control sea lamprey populations in the Great Lakes and reduce our reliance on current chemical treatments.

"Human activities have seriously altered the global nitrogen (N) cycle, increasing the amount of biologically reactive N in circulation and leading to a significant increase in the amount of N transported into aquatic ecosystems. This has resulted in serious environmental problems including reduced quality of drinking water, degraded fish habitat, biodiversity loss, and the proliferation of toxic algae. Factors influencing the amount of N entering lakes are fairly well characterized however the fate of N once it enters a lake is poorly understood. Although global N models suggest that lakes may be important sites of N retention, there is surprisingly little understanding as to the fate of that retained N. Denitrification, alone or coupled with nitrification is an important bacterial transformation that converts dissolved inorganic forms of N into volatile gases that can be released into the atmosphere from aquatic ecosystems. Dinitrogen gas (N2), the end product of denitrification, is a favoured transformation while nitrous oxide (N2O) a by-product of both denitrification and nitrification is a potent greenhouse gas with a warming potential 300 times greater than CO2, is not. Factors regulating the production of N2O and the relative ratio of N2O: N2 in lakes are poorly understood. This research will focus on estimating the production of and the factors regulating N2O gas emissions from Canadian lakes. The intention is to identify ""hot spots"" and ""hot moments"" of microbial N transformations, like denitrification, that produce a greater or lesser amount of the undesirable greenhouse gas, N2O, relative to the more favorable transformation to N2. This research will characterize where within the lake N processes are taking place and compare lakes with different physical, chemical and biological characteristics to identify patterns in time and space as to the type and rates of N processing. Work will also be extended to look at the diversity of N cycling microorganisms, including N-fixing cyanobacteria. Results from this work could serve in regional and larger scale models with the objective of reducing N2O emissions and managing N retention at the landscape level thus preserving the quality and integrity of our Canadian freshwaters.

"Most people know that oil and water do not mix. Take a tablespoon of cooking oil and place it in a glass of water and see what happens. However, it is possible to make a mixture of oil and water mix by using another substance; in fact, that is what we do when we make mayonnaise. This process, called emulsification, is a primary use of certain substances called surfactants (for surface active agents). These materials possess both water loving (hydrophilic) and water-hating (hydrophobic) characteristics. Surfactants are formulated into a vast array of consumer products such as shampoos, laundry detergents, and dish detergents, and are intimately involved in a number of facets of industrial production. Emulsification and industrial applications of surfactants are mainly focused on the ability to make water insoluble materials soluble, and/or 'lift' soily materials from surfaces.

Despite the wide and varied usage, many common surfactants have the same basic chemical structure. Our research program deals with the synthesis of new surfactants that have unique chemical structures, possibly making them perform better in commercial formulations with less damaging consequences to the environment. We are currently focusing our efforts on synthesizing surfactants that have superior hard water tolerance (no soap scum and good foaming ability in hard water) and excellent detergent properties. We will also be turning our attention to the production and characterization of new materials for environmentally friendly detergents and dry cleaning processes. These may eventually lead to new formulations and new products that have superior cleansing properties in consumer applications and better emulsifiers for industrial formulation.

My research program develops open MR scanners, using electromagnetic design techniques to generate the same high-quality magnetic fields with open access instrumentation.

Le syst�me anodique est g�n�ralement compos� d'une anode de carbone dans laquelle vient s'ins�rer, � l'int�rieure de trous localis�s sur sa partie sup�rieure, une structure bim�tallique qui sert � la fois de support m�canique et de conducteur �lectrique. La partie inf�rieure de cette structure comporte un certain nombre de rondins en acier r�unis en sa partie sup�rieure d'une tige en aluminium ou en cuivre. Les rondins sont retenus dans les tourillons � l'aide d'une fonte de scellement. Lors du scellement, la fonte subit, en solidifiant, un retrait g�n�rant ainsi un espace d'air entre celle-ci et le carbone. Cons�quent des propri�t�s thermo-�lectro-m�caniques des constituantes et interfaces de ce syst�me, il en r�sulte une chute de potentielle importante entre le point d'entr�e du courant et la base de l'anode. Une simple r�duction de 3 % de la chute anodique pour une salle de cuve comportant 288 cuves et op�rant � un amp�rage de 300 kA correspond � un montant annuel de l'ordre de 350 k$ et ce, en posant un tarif de 0,035 $ CDN par kWh. Ce projet a comme principal objectif d'�tablir une meilleure compr�hension du comportement en service du syst�me anodique et ce, afin d'en abaisser la chute de potentiel durant sa vie utile. Pour se faire, on propose de proc�der � la caract�risation thermo-�lectro-m�caniques des mat�riaux et interfaces de contact et de d�velopper un outil-m�tier pr�dictif valid�, versatile et robuste, permettant la r�alisation d'�tudes param�triques et de sensibilit� aux niveaux g�om�trique, mat�riel et op�rationnel - �tapes essentielles � la conception et l'optimisation des syst�mes anodiques.

"The goal of my research proposal is to design and build spatially-explicit dynamic models, namely cellular automata (CA) and multi-agent systems (MAS) for environmental resource management. A MAS/CA model is made of two components: a CA model that represents the dynamics of the landscape over which actors make decisions, and a MAS that describes the decision-making architecture of these actors (agents). These two components are then integrated through feedback mechanisms between the agents and their environment. Such models can be used by scientists and land managers to better understand the intricate relationships between social systems and natural systems and to guide decision-making. More specifically, two MAS/CA models will be developed at a local and a regional scale, respectively, in the Calgary region. They will be used to fulfill two objectives: first, to understand how stakeholders make decisions and resolve conflict in a context of common-pool land-use resources, and second to simulate the impact of different management decision scenarios on the environment within which these stakeholders interact. This research will bring a considerable contribution to the field of MAS and CA modeling through a series of conceptual and methodological improvements, such as the use of a vector-based CA model to better represent the evolution of the landscape, the simulation of the learning process of the agents (stakeholders), the representation of their decision-making process, and the feedback mechanism between the agents and their environment. The research will be conducted within the framework of Post-Normal Science and using a participatory approach where the stakeholders will be involved in all major phases of the modeling process. The developed models will help them understanding which strategies could be applied to ensure land-use resource sustainability in their region. The approach proposed in this proposal could also be applied to other regions in Alberta and Canada where managing common-pool land resources is a critical issue.

"The ability of cells to sense and adapt to mechanical stimuli is critical for basic cellular activities like migration, growth, and differentiation, during development. Forces are transferred to the surface membrane from the extracellular matrix (ECM) or intracellularly generated within the actin cytoskeleton. In both cases, the mechanical forces converge on integrins, which cluster within focal adhesion (FA) sites and link ECM to actin cytoskeleton. However, little is known about the contribution of the cell-type dependent intermediate filaments (IFs), such as keratin IFs, and related cell-cell adhesion events, to epithelial cell mechanical activity. Moreover, whether keratin IFs exert a regulatory role in organ development is unclear.



My laboratory is committed to uncover the contribution of keratins 8/18 (K8/K18) IFs to cell mechanosensing and adaptation in response to forces that converge on integrins, using liver epithelial cells as a model system. Our experimental tools include gene silencing, mutant gene generation, high-resolution fluorescence microscopy, microbead trapping with a laser tweezers, and micropost array detectors that measure traction force at FA sites.



This work will clarify the intermediate steps by which K8/K18 IFs regulate the ability of epithelial cells to sense and adapt to mechanical stimuli generated at FA sites. This will also provide new insights into the K8/K18-dependent relationship between cell-cell adhesion and FA during epithelial cell mechanical activity. In addition, it will help to uncover the involvement of K8/K18 IFs in the mechanical stimulation of liver cell lineage establishment during development.

"The proposed research program is intended to develop advanced computer simulation tools for better understanding Earth space plasma environment and enable further advances in space-plasma science; an area in which Canadian scientists have an established tradition of excellence. The proposed research consists of two themes focusing on a) ionospheric modelling and b) spacecraft-plasma interaction modelling. In the first theme, a comprehensive three-dimensional finite element model of the ionosphere would be developed and applied to provide a detailed quantitative description of the physics of the ionosphere; a complex, nonlinear and highly variable medium. A particular attention would be given to the connection between observations made on the ground with magnetometer and radar scattering arrays, and global phenomena taking place in the magnetosphere. With the second theme, modelling spacecraft-plasma interaction would lead to the development and application of advanced computing tools capable of providing insight in basic plasma physics phenomena, and enabling the optimization of and satellites instruments.

          Text-to-speech synthesis is concerned with automatically determining the pronunciation of words from their spellings. This field has important applications including telecommunications-based information services and aids for blind and non-speaking people. There is an apparent commonality between the problem of speech synthesis and the process of human reading. Given this situation, it is surprising that there has been minimal interaction between the two fields. On one hand, studies on human reading can bring some valuable insights into the very challenging problem of mapping letters to sounds in speech synthesis. On the other hand, the study of human reading can benefit from the precision of mathematical models.

          In the last few years, the applicant and colleagues have developed a method for converting letters to sounds for text-to-speech systems. The research program is concerned with using this computer method as a way of increasing our understanding of how people read aloud. 

          This proposal can be divided into three main objectives: 1) Improving our existing model for text-to-speech applications; 2) Demonstrating the capability of our model to account for the key human reading phenomena; 3) Extending the model to languages other than English, as a way of furthering the understanding of the relation between spelling and speech sounds.

"Une partie importante de la population du Qu�bec vit dans une zone � risque de rupture de barrage. Les enqu�tes r�p�t�es de la Commission Internationale des Grands Barrages d�montrent que les apports hydriques exceptionnels sont la premi�re cause de rupture des retenues. Ils conduisent au d�bordement ou � la surcharge des ouvrages et � leur rupture. Les crues de rupture sont brutales et beaucoup plus d�vastatrices que les crues naturelles p�riodiques.

La gestion des eaux des r�servoirs priorise souvent diff�rents objectifs antagonistes. La recherche d'une production �nerg�tique maximale diminue par exemple les capacit�s de laminage des crues. La conciliation des objectifs conduit � une politique de gestion. Depuis quelques ann�es, l'analyse de risque permet � l'op�rateur de quantifier le risque r�siduel de d�faillance que cette politique impose � long terme � la population.

L'objectif de la recherche pr�sent�e est de d�velopper de nouvelles m�thodes, inspir�es de l'analyse de risque, pour informer continuellement l'op�rateur de l'�tat de s�curit� hydraulique de la retenue et de la tendance pr�visible de cet �tat dans l'avenir proche. Les outils qui en r�sulteront serviront � automatiser le suivi en temps r�el de la s�curit� de l'installation. Ils pourront alerter l'op�rateur ou les autorit�s de contr�le en cas de diminution anormale de la s�curit�.

La d�marche scientifique propos�e consiste (1) � trouver quelles sont les pluies, quels sont les vents et leurs effets combin�s qui pourraient surcharger les ouvrages au point d'en engendrer la rupture? (2) � en d�duire le portrait instantan� du risque pr�sent de l'installation; (3) � d�velopper les meilleures m�thodes de calcul de l'al�a, des enjeux et de la vuln�rabilit� pour ce concept; (4) � comparer, pour quelques retenues bien instrument�es, la perception de l'op�rateur et l'image de s�curit� recalcul�e . 

Il en r�sultera un indice de s�curit� hydrique instantan� �tabli � partir des donn�es courantes d'exploitation du syst�me.

"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac muscle abnormality characterized by a prolongation of the repolarization interval between Q and T waves on the electrocardiogram. This syndrome is caused either by congenital or drug-induced disorders of potassium channels localized in the myocardium cell membranes, and can lead to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. A number of prescription medications inducing long QT have been withdrawn from the market over the past decades, and numerous other drugs have failed the regulatory approval for the same reason. Several drugs still available are forced to carry a warning label. These non-antiarrhythmic compounds have diverse chemical structures and belong to different pharmacological classes (antibiotics, antihistamines, etc). Many medications that prolong the QT interval do so at therapeutic doses. Importantly, virtually all cases of drug-induced LQTS are due to the blockade of the heart human ether-a-go-go-related-gene (hERG) potassium transmembrane channel. One of the greatest challenges in drug design, is, thus, the elaboration of active substances that do not or only slightly bind to hERG channels. Our goal is to better understand the drug-induced blockade of hERG potassium channels causing LQTS. At present, little is known of the structure-activity relationship of the channel blockade or the interaction site(s) inside and around (lipid membrane vicinity) the channel. The determination of molecular characteristics that dictate drug-hERG channel interactions and the location of the binding site(s), using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-NMR) and complementary biophysical techniques, could improve our knowledge of drug action and help in predicting their toxicity.

"This proposal is concerned with issues revolving around the theme of pricing and revenue management, currently one of the most active fields in operations research. It is best explained in the context of an airline that wishes to improve its profitability in a competitive environment, and traditionally involves four components: demand forecasting, overbooking policy, seat inventory control, and pricing. The common thread to these components is that, in contrast with stretegic issues such as aircraft purchasing or route modifications, they do not require capital investment and have a low impact on costs, although they have a direct impact on revenues. My research in this field has been motivated by earlier studies in bilevel programming, a branch of mathematics where a decision maker (a government, a firm) incorporates within its decision process the reaction of other agents (competitors, customers) to its own course of action. This approach, although natural in the revenue management context, yields mathematical formulations that are extremely challenging from the computational point of view.



My research will be concerned with the theoretical properties of bilevel RM models, together with the design of solution approaches. In this process, close attention will be paid to the modeling of the demand side of the problem, which consists of customers acting with either complete or limited (bounded) rationality. This leads to game-theoretic considerations and to the development of new tools in equilibrium programming. In particular, I will also design models where customer behavior is in accordance with complex discrete choice models. I will address the issue of capacities in equilibrium model, a topic that I have touched upon in the realm of traffic assignment.



Finally, I intend to test the new developments on real data provided by private firms.

"In many practical noisy channels, input sequences are constrained in order to enable the channel to operate effectively. For instance, in magnetic and optical recording channels input sequences are constrained in a variety of ways to ensure accurate timing and reduce the likelihood of certain kinds of error events. Input constraints also model memory that is typically present in data recording channels and band-limited communication channels. 



For many of the most important input-constrained channels, there is no explicit formula known for capacity, which is defined as the maximal rate at which information can be transmitted without error. We plan to focus on two main themes for input-constrained channels: 1) estimates and asymptotics for capacity of input-constrained channels and 2) construction of good codes for such channels.   



For 1), we will investigate estimates and asymptotics for entropy rate of Hidden Markov chains, and apply this to capacity of input-constrained channels. 



For 2), we will focus on coding schemes that limit error propagation and coding schemes that combine input constraints with error correction.

"We will study the evolution and structure-function relationships of alpha-proteobacteria replication origins (alpha-oris).  We propose that alpha-oris have a unique genetic position allowing their primary identification and isolation by PCR.  We will also test the evolutionary range of specific regulatory mechanisms including the usage of DnaA (ATP/ADP switching), response regulator CtrA (phospho-relay) signaling and DNA methylation.  Preliminary data and DNA alignments predict that DnaA usage is ubiquitous, while the usage of CtrA and DNA methylation mechanisms is restricted.  We also predict novel alpha-ori binding proteins for specific subgroups.  We chose species from 6 diverse subgroups of alpha-proteobacteria: 1 Caulobacteraceae ('freshwater Caulobacters' e.g. Caulobacter crescentus), 2 Hyphomonadaceae ('marine Caulobacters' e.g. Maricaulis maris), 3 Rhizobiaceae (e.g. Sinorhizobium meliloti), 4 Sphingomonadaceae (e.g. Zymomonas mobilis), 5 Rickettsiaceae (e.g. Rickettsia prowazekii) and 6 the 'SAR11 clade' (e.g. Pelagibacter ubique).  We isolated presumed oris from representatives of each subgroup and we wish to test the requirements for autonomous ori-plasmid replication.  DNA alignments and motif scans suggest targets for site-directed mutations.  These targets include conserved 'DnaA boxes', proposed CtrA binding sites, DNA methylation sites, as well as other conspicuously conserved short ori DNA motifs that suggest binding sites for novel regulatory proteins. We will use protein-DNA 'footprinting techniques' to measure the affinities of established Caulobacter crescentus ori binding proteins DnaA and CtrA to the new alpha-oris.  Novel ori binding proteins will also be isolated by biochemical criteria.  

       Novelty and Significance: Replication origins and their regulators not only direct DNA synthesis they also direct critical metabolic processes.  The scope and diversity of this regulation is poorly understood. Growing bacteria are very vulnerable to antibiotics.  The specific ways that bacteria co-ordinate growth and replication is also relevant for understanding and designing new antibiotics.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Microbiology and Immunology","Marczynski, Gregory","RGPIN ",Bacteriology,Microbiology,Microbiologie,1-5

"Small-scale ecophysiological processes can have large-scale impacts on terrestrial carbon cycling.  As a complement to my participation and leadership in the Fluxnet-Canada and Canadian Carbon Program Research Networks, I propose research focused on improving our ability to use measurements of physiological processes and states at the leaf and canopy level to evaluate these processes at larger spatial scales. I propose three complementary areas of study that address some key knowledge gaps in carbon cycle science. (1) We will examine how we might link the dynamic spectral characteristics of boreal forest vegetation to its photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE).  We will add measurements of spectral reflectance and foliar pigments at our Quebec flux sites so as to better understand the contributions of sunlit and shadow canopy fractions to LUE under different levels of stress and stages of phenological development. This could lead to a robust methodology for scaling LUE. (2) We will test different approaches for evaluating forest biomass at large spatial scales using an airborne and a satellite-based lidar and thereby obtain more reliable estimates of aboveground autotrophic respiration for northern ecosystems. We will assess the extent to which different aspects of the sampling (e.g., cover type, slope) drive the variability. We will then use this information to scale the satellite measurements to provincial, national, and circumpolar scales.  (3) We will use our flux tower data to evaluate methods for scaling freeze-thaw events and their physiological implications at local to regional scales.  We will do this by linking physiological processes and environmental conditions at our flux sites to freeze-thaw data products obtained from a satellite-based microwave sensor.  This will allow us to examine how the severity, duration, and distribution of freezing and thawing across a landscape relates to the photosynthetic and respiratory fluxes at our flux sites.  It will also allow us to determine how these freeze-thaw dynamics relate to the several thousand square km footprints sampled by the high-precision carbon dioxide concentration measurements we are making as part of the Canadian Carbon Program.

"We seek to advance the resolution and fidelity of the science of seismic imaging such that, with great precision,

we may monitor fluids within hydrocarbon reservoirs and track injected gasses. With a focus on Canada's

resource and sequestration environments, we will optimize recovery of Canada's finite resources and verify that

sequestered greenhouse gasses remain in place.

Like photography, seismic images are formed with waves. The seismic wavelength, however, is about a

billion times longer than a light wavelength, so high-resolution ""photography"" of the subsurface is a significant

challenge. An additional challenge to high resolution imaging is subsurface complexity. Though highly

trained field crews record seismic data with sophisticated equipment, the complex earth between the crew and

the target acts as an unknown and very complex lens. Seismic images, then, suffer from resolution limits due

to the long seismic wavelength, and distortion due to the practical limitations of field recording, the imperfectly

known earth lens, and imperfectly understood physics. To compensate for these effects, we process seismic

data with image construction algorithms but this process is far from optimal. Consequently, we cannot reliably

identify rock and fluid type or resolve reservoir detail.

Our research program in seismic imaging systematically addresses seismic resolution, field acquisition

limitations, the unknown lens of the Earth, and suboptimal image construction. We do this through a

combination of controlled field experimentation, mathematical and physical modelling, and image algorithm

development. We will deploy our research seismic crew to conduct experiments aimed at improving fidelity

and completeness of the recorded wavefields and to better understand the physics of seismic wave propagation

and attenuation. In parallel activity, we will conduct physical model experiments and also develop novel

numerical modelling methods. These three sources of data will then drive our development of more robust

imaging algorithms and associated techniques.","Oil, gas and coal","Energy resources",Geoscience,"Margrave, Gary","CRDPJ ","Applied geophysics",Geophysics,"G�ophysique",1-5
"This project addresses seismic imaging with the goal of substantial improvements in the resolution and the reliability of such images.  Present seismic imaging technology has developed mostly as refinements of conceptual paradigms that first emerged in the middle of the 20th century, such as raytracing and hyperbolic traveltime surfaces.  More recently, inverse scattering approaches have proven that much more can be done.  In my personal work, I have shown that modern mathematical concepts, such as Gabor transforms and pseudodifferential operators, can result in substantial improvements both in resolution and image accuracy.  This proposed research will build upon these successes by extending recently developed nonstationary Gabor deconvolution and depth migration methods with new capabilities.  Gabor deconvolution corrects seismic data for earth attenuation effects while simultaneously optimizing the seismic wavelet.  This process will be improved by constraining the method to estimate a spatially consistent attenuation model, by incorporating more information from available boreholes, and by an improved understanding of seismic wavelet phase.  My recently developed depth imaging methods, the FOCI method and the Gabor Imaging method, will be extended to 3D and optimized for numerical performance.  In both cases, the 3D extension involves significant research challenges but the rewards could be large since both have been shown to give exceptionally high resolution.  Both methods will be studied as possible engines for imaging velocity analysis and for iterative inversion methods.  Also, the imaging of nonstandard wave types, such as mode-converted reflections and multiples, will be pursued.  Finally, the basic design of 3D seismic surveys will be analyzed from the perspective of mathematical sampling theory.  It has been shown that practical surveys can never meet the requirements of proper unaliased sampling and so it is intended to seek acquisition geometries, i.e. the placement of sources and receivers, and imaging algorithms, that will minimize the consequences of unavoidable aliasing.

"The research program's broad objective is to synthesize, characterize and process novel block, random and gradient copolymers for application as next-generation organic photovoltaic materials, nanoporous separations media and tailored macromolecular surfactants. To achieve the requisite tailored microstructures for such applications, my group is aiming to develop efficient routes via state-of-the-art controlled radical polymerization (CRP) techniques.  CRP has indicated potential to control microstructure (narrow molecular weight distribution, precise segment length) at nearly the same level as traditional ionic or other ""living"" polymerization methods without the exhaustive purification, functional group protection and tedious reaction conditions required of ionic polymerizations. Other crucial advantages of CRP are its ability to link different blocks and/or monomers which otherwise could not be achieved by ionic polymerization and the possibility of polymerization in dispersed aqueous media. This versatility allows an unprecedented number of possible combinations to achieve desired nano-structured materials.  Underlying the long-range objective of materials applications is the fundamental study of various aspects of CRP chemistry to ensure our target materials are sufficiently pure and characterized. In parallel, my research group is applying the research from our fundamental studies directly into desired products. These results will be applied to the development of organic photovoltaics, which we are designing from electron donor/acceptor block copolymers from simple monomer building blocks using CRP techniques.  This will lead to flexible low-cost polymeric solar cells useful to alleviate fossil-fuel reliance and help meet current and future energy demands.

"SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL FOR PUBLIC RELEASE



   The ability of cells to move is a fundamental process common to all species, from humans to the invisible microbes. The strategies used for cell movement by the different species are highly conserved such that studying how a human cell moves will help to understand how microbes move and vice versa. The movement of cells, also referred to as cellular migration is required for all aspects of life, from how the embryo divides to how a wound heals on our hand, to why all the cells in our body stick together. The reason why the mechanisms involved in cellular migration are conserved amongst the species is because many of the proteins required to mediate movement are conserved as well. These proteins cause the movement of a cell by communicating with each other such that messages are transmitted throughout the cell telling it when to move/stay/change shape/move in the opposite direction or just stop. 

    My research team has recently discovered a group of proteins that communicate with each other by direct physical contact. We are currently studying what this new protein interaction means and how the new communication conduit is able to change the behaviour of the cell.  What we uncover with our experiments will provide insight into how cells move at a molecular level and provide a possible strategy to alter the movement of cells.

"Vision is critical for guiding walking and provides information regarding characteristics of the terrain, the context of the walking task, and possible threats in the environment. This information is combined with signals from other sensory systems concerning the nature of the surface characteristics, unexpected destabilizing events, and the state of the limbs to allow for a smooth walking pattern. Surprisingly, it is not clear whether and how visual information about the environment can modify input transmitted via these other sensory pathways despite its potential to have a wide ranging influence. 

    Cutaneous information from the foot is important for regulating the step cycle during walking and is thought to be involved in the correct positioning of the foot. When cutaneous receptors are activated a cutaneous reflex may be elicited (which can be experimentally simulated using electrical stimulation) and reflected in changes in muscle activity. Since vision is particularly crucial in situations that require precise foot placement, visual input may have a powerful effect on cutaneous reflexes. In the proposed research I will test the general hypothesis that visual information modifies cutaneous reflexes from the foot during human walking in a predictive, context-dependent manner. A series of projects will address this by (1) determining whether cutaneous reflexes from the foot are modulated in tasks that require fine control of foot placement, (2) establishing how the quality of visual input influences cutaneous reflexes in these situations, and (3) ascertaining whether a visuomotor task under elevated perceived threat affects the modulation of cutaneous reflexes.

    Together, these projects will provide an important bridge between work in animals that has illustrated the role of cutaneous input in the control of limb placement and human experiments that have described the use of visual information to guide walking. It is hoped that a better understanding of how vision modifies sensory feedback during walking may prove useful in the design of assistive devices for people with visual impairments related to age or neurologic condition.

"The main target of this mostly-experimental research program is the set of new physical relations implicit in  the interplay between matter and ultrashort ultra-intense optical fields of femtosecond pulses.  

The principal near-term efforts will be concentrated in two areas:  1) fairly basic plasma physics which arises at ultra-high, relativisitically relevant intensities (> 10^{18} W  cm^{-2}):  high-harmonic generation, attosecond pulse generation, changes in Debye shielding under  high-field interactions, relativistic changes in laser-particle coupling, and generation of energetic ions and  electrons; and  2) fairly applied optical- and plasma-physics relevant to ultrafast-laser materials-processing of glasses and  metals, including micromachining and direct index-writing;  we are also studying related problems with  biotissues, relevant to medical applications. 

The first of these areas is likely to contribute to basic understanding of relativistic laser-plasma interactions,  and may lead to practical applied physics relevant to the 'fast ignitor' scheme of laser-fusion.  Training and  preliminary experiments can take place on the terawatt CPA laser in my laboratory, but most publishable work  must take place on one of the large international laser systems, e.g., CEA-Saclay ('Salle Chaude') in France, or  the ALLS laser system in Canada. 

The second area is experimentally related, in that it involves ultrafast lasers but at more moderate intensities.   This meets the needs for hands-on training of students in laser-matter interaction experiments, and provides an  applied and industrially relevant component of research while still emphasizing the science. This work uses  two systems in my own laboratories:  a 133 MHz pulsetrain burst laser system of 1 ps pulses, and a system of  100fs pulses at kHz and 80 MHz rates. The research includes a modest analytical and computational theory component, in-house and in collaboration  elsewhere, including particle-in-cell (PIC) code simulations of relativistic laser-plasma interactions in 1D and  in 2D, and also molecular dynamic (MD) modelling of solids.  Analytically, we conduct effective-dielectric  modelling of nanostructured materials, and of beam-channelling in plasmas. 

The thorniest problem of intense laser-plasma interaction physics has been to observe new effects while at the  same time one determines the conditions of interaction empirically -- a particularly difficult and complex  diagnostic problem for ultra-intense laser-produced plasmas.  My research style has been to set cleanly  defined/diagnosed experimental problems, suited for comparison to theoretical predictions, rather than  immediately to pursue 'extreme' conditions phenomenologically.  The expertise we have developed in  diagnostics and also in modelling are well-suited to a group the size of mine.

"The proposed research will investigate into resource, mobility and traffic management issues in hybrid wireless/wireline networks (e.g., wireless LANs, cellular and Internet) and interworked wireless mesh networks such as WiFi (IEEE 802.11 series) and WiMAX (IEEE 802.16 series).  The long term objective is to develop in-depth knowledge towards the construction of a flexible and robust cross-domain internetworking architecutre, i.e., an information transport platform, for handling multimedia services in fixed and mobile environments.  The short term objectives are to (i) investigate cooperative diversity with partial channel state information, to be acquired via channel estimation, (ii) investigate dynamic spectral access in cognitive radio, (iii) investigate cross-layer design and optimization for interworked wireless mesh networks, and (iv) develop modeling and analysis methods for wireless Internet.  The results from the short term objectives will form the building blocks toward fulfillment of the long term objective.



Communication over wireless interconnected networks has a number of challenging issues, chief among which is the bottleneck created by the wireless propagation channel, the dynamics induced by user mobility.  The research program laid out by the above four objectives addresses very challenging issues, each of which embodies a rich paradigm for contributions of new knowledge, novel signaling techniques, enabling networking technology, etc., and a rich environment for the training of highly qualified personnel.  Protocol design making efficient use of elements and traffic profiles across adjacent layers can lead to flexibility and robustness.  A flexible and robust information transport platform that allows for information transmission from anywhere at anytime with user QoS satisfaction will indeed have a great impact on the social and economic welfare of Canada.

"Quantum gravity is the problem of joining quantum theory to general relativity to make a theory of space and time.  I study models of quantum spacetime, which I treat as analogous to problems in condensed matter physics in that the challenge is to understand how macroscopic behavior is emergent from a many body system.   In my work I have shown these can be addressed by using methods initially developed to model quantum computers.  I propose to use these new methods to investigate the theoretical and observational consequences of specific models of quantum spacetime.

"Here we propose to analyze the nuclear safety performance of the SCWR, a Generation IV nuclear system, based on the following two considerations: excellence in safety and reliability and a very low likelihood and degree of reactor core damage. Because the SCWR is a nuclear system, its general behavior is controlled by reactor physics, which is used to predict the population of neutrons in the core with time as well as the changes in reactivity resulting from variation in the core properties. These changes may take place as the reactor operates and their impact on the reactor safety must be assessed. One must also minimize the likelihood of core damage that could result from postulated accident scenarios. This implies selecting a fuel configuration that will make the coolant void and power reactivity coefficients negative while optimizing fuel consumption. Finally, the efficiency of the reactivity control mechanism and shutdown systems for operation conditions or during accident scenarios must also be assessed since they play an important role to ensure the safety of the reactor. 

Our research program is aimed at characterizing the safety parameters of the SCWR using the chain of reactor physics codes DRAGON (an industry standard toolset (IST) code of the Canadian nuclear industry for lattice cell calculation) and DONJON (a finite reactor diffusion code). It will consist of three parts. We will first generalize the CANDU simulation procedures to the SCWR problem and compute the various safety related parameters associated with the SCWR. Then we will refine these reference models in such a way that environment dependent DRAGON simulations are taken into account in DONJON. Finally we will optimize the SCWR design towards higher safety and improved fuel consumption starting with the fuel and reactivity control devices. We will also perform a series of optimization studies from which we will propose a refueling procedure (maximize fuel burnup) as well as locations for the reactivity control mechanisms and neutron detector (optimized for effectiveness) in the core.

"A great deal of work that is done by statisticians exploits the idea of a statistical model. Such a model enables analysts to, amongst other things, quantify their uncertainty about the numerical value of a real world phenomenon, make predictions of events in the future and to test scientific hypotheses.  The model itself though is just a tool and like any other needs to be selected with care. The objective of the research is to find ways of evaluating the effect of the choice of a particular model in a given problem. Somewhat surprisingly it turns out that tools from the world of geometry are very useful in this assessment. The project will develop these geometrically based tools in ways that the working statistician will be able to exploit.

"One of the greatest challenges facing neuroscience is to understand the cellular basis of cognition, which critically requires identifying neural activity patterns over widespread regions of the brain.  Functional imaging methods (e.g., PET, fMRI) provide low spatiotemporal resolution across the brain; while microelectrode recordings provide precise resolution, but with limited sampling capabilities.  What has been missing, until recently, is a method revealing functional activity during multiple epochs of behavior with cellular resolution - a problem recently solved by visualizing immediate-early genes (IEGs).  When neurons engage in high frequency activity, they transcribe IEGs which are immediately visible within the nucleus.  Subsequently (~30 min), the mRNA is translocated to the cytoplasm.  Because mRNA can be resolved in two cellular compartments, it is possible to identify active neurons during two behavioral epochs in the same animal. Thus, like fMRI or PET, IEGs provides repeated activity measurements in the same subject, but with the cellular resolution to delineate neural networks engaged in specific behaviors.  During spatial exploration, hippocampal cells fire in distinct physical locations, collectively creating an environment-specific ""map"" thought to establish the context of an episode to be remembered. These cells also reliably transcribe IEGs, permitting estimates of the size/consistency of place maps comparable to direct neuronal recording.  Unlike direct recordings, however, IEG expression permits a limitless sample of precisely how many cells are engaged in an environment, and how the size/consistency of active populations change with the environment.  Thus, the current grant capitalizes on the unique advantages of using IEG expression to (1) create estimates of how the number of active cells during (1) behavior and (2) subsequent memory-related processing change according to the physical characteristics of the environment (e.g., size/complexity of the environment) as well as (3) how these changes relate to learning.  These studies provide critical data on the information that most reliably influences hippocampal activity and provide insight into the nature of the computations that define behavioral context.

"Metal-air batteries are energy storage systems attractive for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles due to their high specific energy and to the low cost and low toxicity of the electrode materials. Solar cells are devices that convert directly renewable solar energy into electricity. In order to improve the power density and lifetime of metal-air batteries, the long term objective of this proposal (Phase I) is to develop highly active and stable bifunctional oxygen electrode materials. In these devices, oxygen reduction (OR) is occurring during the discharge and oxygen evolution (OE) during the recharge, at the same electrode material. Novel MyCu1-yCo2O4 electrocatalysts (M = Mn or Li) will be dispersed on an Nb-doped TiO2 conductive support and fixed on a glassy carbon disk. The factors responsible for the electrode activity and stability will be assessed by studying the effects of the catalyst/support properties and of the electrode preparation parameters on the electrode properties and performance for the OR and OE reactions. O2- and air-feeded gas diffusion electrodes with an active layer containing the most promising catalyst/support powders will be investigated. The long-term objective of Phase II of this proposal is to develop a compact, highly efficient, stable and low-cost solar cell based on an original concept: a solvent-free gel electrolyte in junction with highly porous n-type CuInS2 or Cu(In,Al)S2 semiconductor; the catalyst CoS completes the device. Despite the advantages of using a gel electrolyte (e.g., mechanical stability), evaporation of the organic solvent will dry the gel and decrease the cell performance that should, on the contrary, be enhanced. Gel electrolytes, composed of new redox couples dissolved in an ambient temperature ionic liquid (very low vapor pressure) and incorporated in a polymer matrix, will therefore be developed. Also, the preparation of CuInS2 will be optimized and less expensive Cu(In,Al)S2 will be investigated. In order to get a better understanding of the factors responsible for the device performance, a series of redox couples, solvent-free electrolytes, nanosized CuInS2 and Cu(In,Al)S2 particles and films, and solar cells incorporating the optimal components will be characterized.

"Ore deposits and their associated alteration haloes are rare and unique geologic occurrences that provide valuable windows through which to observe and document the tectonic and fluid evolution of Earth over a wide range of pressure, temperature and time conditions. Detailed examination of selected deposit types including; epithermal, intrusion-related and shear-zone hosted gold, iron-oxide copper gold, and gemstones (specifically emerald) will be utilized to establish ore deposit models and tectono-metamorphic histories of their host terranes in key areas of the Canadian Cordillera and other comparative orogens. This research will determine the pressures and temperatures of specific mineral equilibria within selected economic and sub-economic ore deposits, using detailed mapping, petrography, thermodynamic equilibria and a variety of modern analytical techniques including scanning-electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, electron microprobe mineral analyses, fluid inclusion studies, laser-ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, C, O, and S stable isotope analyses. The ages of the ore and host rocks will be determined using geological mapping and radiometric dating techniques such as Ar/Ar, Rb/Sr, Sm/Nd and U/Pb isotope studies where applicable. These data will also provide information pertinent to continental break up and fluid mineralizing hydrothermal fluid events in this tectonic setting. In addition, the development of a novel technique to study fluid inclusion compositions using sonoluminescence and sonochemistry will be undertaken.      

This program will support at least 4 thesis projects at the graduate level and several undergraduate students. The focus is on producing graduate and undergraduate students with a breadth of knowledge across the earth sciences through engaging them in multi-disciplinary research projects. Students will also be involved in multi-agency projects to maximize their exposure to academia, government and industry, preparing them for their choice of various career paths.

"The TRIUMF Weak Interaction Symmetry Test (TWIST) is a search for tiny deviations from the pattern of

muon decays predicted by the very successful Standard Model of particle interactions. The Standard Model, a

theory which agrees with many observations over many years, is nonetheless believed by most subatomic

physicists to be only an approximation to a more basic and precise model whose properties are as yet not

known. The Standard Model is incomplete and leaves several questions unanswered, for example, why just

three generations, and why do the particles have the masses they do?

The Standard Model classifies the most fundamental particles into three ""generations""; only particles of the

first or lowest generation make up the materials of our everyday lives. The muon is the lightest and most

accessible fundamental charged particle of a higher generation. It nearly always decays into an electron and two

very light, elusive, neutral particles called neutrinos. High quality beams of muons are produced at TRIUMF,

and a very high precision detector system in a high solenoidal magnetic field is used to accurately measure the

direction and energy of the positive electron (or positron) produced for each of billions of positive decays. The

pattern or symmetry of these decays is precisely predicted by the Standard Model.

If found, a deviation from expectations based on the Standard Model would provide clues to the character of a

more basic description of the smallest particles in our universe. On the other hand, if no deviation is found,

some hypothesized features of a more basic description can be eliminated from consideration.","Physical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Science Division","Marshall, Glen","SAPPJ ","Particle physics",Physics,Physique,3-3

"Cell surface receptors are a key group of proteins targeted by drugs for the treatment of disease.  Cell surface receptors may bind proteins or other target molecules that carry messages to the cell. There has been a concerted, but largely unsuccessful, effort to find a way to directly isolate and analyze the proteins in receptor complexes since the middle of the last century.  I propose to create a method to directly capture a receptor complex from the surface of live cells by fixing their binding target onto microscopic beads.  I will use a protein from blood to capture its receptor complex from the surface of living white blood cells.  Human white blood cells have receptors that bind to germs to engulf and destroy them.  Antibodies for bacterial recognition may be attached to microscopic beads.  The beads will be used to capture the receptor complex for engulfing germs from the surface of the white blood cells.  The microbeads carrying the receptor beads will be collected and the receptor proteins captured will be identified by mass spectrometry.  Different types of salts and detergents as well as enzymes will be used to remove common cellular material such as DNA, RNA or ribosomes that tend to stick to beads.  The optimal type of bead, size of bead, chemical method of attachment to the bead, and time for collecting the beads will be determined.  The best methods for extracting the receptor proteins and to fractionate them using chromatography prior to identification will be determined.  The proteins can be identified by breaking them into pieces with enzymes, and separating them followed by mass spectrometry and computer searching using classical mathematics.  Proteins identified from extracted receptor complexes will be confirmed with a laser microscope by independent methods such as the use of specific antibodies and green fluorescence tagging.  The method will elucidate the proteins required by the receptor complex for engulfing germs.  More importantly, our success would mean that Canada will have a general method for isolating receptor complexes directly from the surface of live cells.  This will permit the identification and validation of new and specific drug targets for the treatment of many diseases.

A key ingredient of vehicle autonomy is ""navigation""; that is, the ability of a mobile robot to estimate its pose with respect to its environment, which is difficult in such GPS-deprived environments.  The essence of this grant application is born from a realization that there exists a significant and largely unexplored opportunity in the combination of ideas from the emerging field of cooperative control with real problems in vehicle navigation.  The applicant proposes to study the problems of designing and applying local interactions among multiple vehicles to enhance a group's navigational abilities as compared with vehicles that work only individually.



The long-term objective of this research program is to advance an engineering basis for cooperative navigation; i.e., to synthesize provable and robust estimation algorithms that strive to achieve marked improvement over existing navigation techniques that do not exploit the use of multiple agents and/or lack development from an engineering point of view.  In particular, this research focuses on distributed estimation problems with applications to vehicle operations.  Two short-term research strands are planned for the period covered by this application: 1) a ""synthesis and design"" strand will establish a framework for distributed estimation that is directly applicable to the problem of cooperatively localizing multiple vehicles in first known (i.e., mapped) and, subsequently, unknown environments; and, 2) an ""application"" strand will focus on validating the research through the development of at least one practical example.  This work, in turn, will contribute to a body of basic research that is suitable to a spectrum of engineering applications, including planetary rover navigation, mining operations, transportation, and security robotics.

"Real algebraic geometry studies geometrical objects arising in connection with the mathematical modeling of the ""real world"", i.e., the mathematical description of physical objects as well as of natural and man-made processes in science and technology. The most basic functions considered in real algebraic geometry are the polynomial functions in n real variables with real coefficients. The domains considered are subsets of real n-space defined by polynomial equations and inequalities. A basic problem is to determine the minimum (or maximum) value of such a function on such a domain. This is a hard problem in general, but various fast algorithms based on semidefinite programming can be used to obtain estimates for the minimum value. The theoretical basis for these algorithms is the close relationship that exists between positive polynomials and sums of squares. The study of the relationship between positive polynomials and sums of squares is an old subject, dating back to work of Hilbert in the late 19th century. Landmarks include Artin's solution of Hilbert's 17th problem in 1927, Krivine's Positivstellensatz in 1964, and Schmuedgen's Positivstellensatz (dealing with the case when the domain in question is compact) in 1991. The main object of the proposed research is to understand this relationship better, and apply this information to understand better how these fast algorithms will perform in practical situations.

"This research program aims to improve understanding of glacier and ice sheet response to climate change.  My research group uses a combination of glaciological modelling and glacier-climate field studies to assess changes in glacier mass balance and to examine the role of glaciers as a dynamic component of Earth's climate system.  Regionally, glacier and icefield retreat affects alpine ecology, tourism, hydroelectric power generation, and the supply of surface water for significant population bases and agricultural activities. We are developing glaciological models to simulate glacier and ice sheet evolution over decadal time scales. Field studies for the period 2009-2014 will focus on historical and future icefield changes and water resource implications in western Canada, building on our established research program on the Haig Glacier, Canadian Rockies.  Beginning in spring 2009, we will expand these efforts to the Illecillewaet Glacier, Glacier National Park, B.C. The Illecillewaet is a headwaters region of the Columbia River, with a high percentage of glacier cover and a more maritime-influenced climate. Meteorological controls of snow accumulation and snow/ice melt may differ significantly from those in the Canadian Rockies.  Globally, glacier and ice sheet retreat has accelerated the rate of sea level rise, with considerable uncertainty as to how much additional sea-level rise can be expected this century. Advances in coupled glacier-climate modelling are needed to address this.  This includes a number of numerical modelling issues that we aim to confront: the inclusion of higher-order terms in the ice sheet stress balance, improvements to the numerical representation of glacier and ice sheet margins, and downscaling strategies for regional climate patterns in areas of complex topography. Climate fields need to be extrapolated from sparse observational records or interpolated from climate models (or reanalyses) to the scale of influence for glacier and ice sheet mass balance, order 1-10 km.  Our field studies support the numerical modelling through examination of mass balance processes and high-elevation temperature and precipitation gradients, providing constraints on free parameters in regional- and global-scale glaciological modelling.

"Teleost fish osmoregulate using active ion and water transport mechanisms of the gills, intestine, kidney and urinary bladder.  These epithelial structures contain specialized epithelial transport cells with regulated transport proteins.  We study regulation of these transporters in situ in the native epithelium, particularly in mitochondria rich chloride cells of the teleost gill and related osmoregulatory organs as our physiological model system.  The ion secretion by hardy euryhaline teleosts such as the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus is rapidly regulated by hormones, neurotransmitters and by the osmotic level of the blood.  When fish move from seawater to fresh water, their blood becomes diluted; this transient decrease in osmolality rapidly and reversibly inhibits the salt (NaCl) secretion that is normally present in seawater.  In turn, the effect helps the animal retain salt while in fresh water.  The effect is a direct cell level regulation by ion transportng cells that sense changes in osmolality.  Conversely, blood concentration, such as occurs when the fish enter hypersaline environments stimulates saltsecretion.  In addition, these cells also undergo compensation to regulate cell volume.  The mechanism involves a series of regulatory proteins, protein kinases and phosphatases that activate or deactivate (respectively) the membrane-bound ion transporters.  The research is important to comparative physiology, comparative endocrinology, fisheries and aquaculture.  Also, because the anion channel  ""Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator"" (CFTR) transports salt in this system, studies of CFTR regulation in fish may be important to discovery of CFTR regulation and important to discovering underlying causes of Cystic Fibrosis.","Commercial fisheries","Natural resources (economic aspects)",Biology,"Marshall, William","RGPIN ","Animal physiology and metabolism","Animal biology","Biologie animale",1-5
"Within the general objective of optimizing procedures to  remediate soil that has been burdened with excesses of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) and trace metals (TMs), a series of studies have been designed to maximize the efficiency of the overall process while minimizing costs. The process consists of four sequential steps. Pollutants (HOCs and TMs) are simultaneously mobilized/removed from the soil by washing with an aqueous surfactant suspension (ASS) containing complexing reagent(s). The HOC fraction is recovered by back-extraction of the ASS phase with a non-polar organic solvent (hexane) and detoxified by hydrodechlorination /reduction during contact with a noble-metal catalyst. Subsequently, the heavy metal fraction is recovered by precipition with zero-valent magnesium (Mg0) to form insoluble oxyhydroxides that are recovered by filtration. The purified ASS fraction (now devoid of both HOCs and TMs) is returned to clean more soil. With this process, both classes of toxicant are converted to toxicologically innocuous products. 

Nano-scale inorganic particles (NIPs) will be evaluated as accelerators to (i.) reduce/remove oxyanions from the aqueous extract and/or (ii.) to mediate the hydrodechlorination of HOCs in ASS extract.  The activities (iii.) of non-reducing chemicals that accelerate the oxyanion removal rates will be characterized in detail. Additionally, (iv.), less persistent comlexing reagents will be evaluated, with field-contaminated soils, for efficacy, and compatibility with non-ionic surfactants. Finally, (v.) engineered nano-scale Pd bimetallic mixtures supported on a basic oxidic support will be synthesized and evaluated as catalysts for hydrodechlorination and dearomatization of HOC fractions in supercritical carbon dioxide.  The principal advantages of chemical processing are that the clean up can be completed rapidly and the processing can deal with more heavily contaminated matrices that typically inactivate biologically mediated remediation processes. The principal disadvantage relative to bioremediation strategies is considered to be cost. The challenge remains to make these abiotic processes as efficient and cost effective as possible.

"Seed protein accumulation is dependent on the supply of nitrogen to the developing embryo, which influences the partitioning of carbon into the different storage products. Asparagine is a key transport form of nitrogen in higher plants. The enzyme asparaginase is hypothesized to play a critical role in the supply of nitrogen to sink tissues including developing seeds. This enzyme breaks down asparagine into aspartate and ammonia, which is re-assimilated and used in the synthesis of other amino acids. A correlation between free asparagine levels in developing seeds and protein content at maturity has been observed in soybean and cereals, suggesting a possible role of asparagine as a metabolite signal regulating protein accumulation. The objectives of this proposal are to achieve a detailed understanding of asparagine catabolism in higher plants, and of asparagine function and perception as a nitrogen metabolite signal. Approaches including the study of enzyme structure and function, molecular genetics, transcript and metabolite profiling, and metabolic biochemistry will be used to address this goal. The proposed research should improve our understanding of the process of seed nitrogen supply, and may lead to biotechnological strategies to manipulate the levels of storage products, either to enhance nutritional value or for bio-industrial applications.

"Supply chains are networks of logistic and manufacturing activities starting with raw material sourcing and ending with the distribution of finished goods to markets. A complete supply chain usually involves several companies and several production/warehousing facilities. The performance of a supply chain for a given product-market critically depends on two interdependent strategic issues: 1) the network structure, i.e. the number, location, mission, technology and capacity of the facilities of the firms involved; 2) the material flow planning and control processes used, i.e. the methods used to prepare aggregate plans, to compute requirements, lot-sizes, safety-buffers, etc., and to schedule operations for the various production/distribution stages in the network. My research is dealing: 1) at a global level, with the development of methodologies and tools to evaluate potential structural and procedural supply chain strategies; 2) at a more detailed level, with the formulation and solution of mathematical models which can be used to optimize the supply chain network structure or to plan material flows in specific contexts. In both cases, an effort is made to formulate models which can be integrated in distributed planning systems for specific industrial sectors. 



Currently, most of my research work is done in collaboration with companies of the forest product industry and with the Canadian Armed Forces. The tools developed are based mainly on mixed integer programming models, stochastic programming models, heuristics (derived through Lagrangian decomposition and relaxation, successive LP...) and on Monte-Carlo methods. The design of efficient supply chains is currently considered as one of the main business strategies to improve the competitiveness of companies and networks of companies and the proposed research will provide more powerful tools to do this.

"Electro-Optical Studies on Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors

     The carbon nanotubes (CNs) are electronic nanostructures having outstanding properties for electrical conduction. Because of their unique 1D structure and composition, two important members of the CN family, the single-wall (SWNTs) and the double-wall (DWNTs) carbon nanotubes, have been regarded as being right at the interface between molecules and crystalline solids. These CN materials thus present properties that are specific to both worlds and they are ideal for making devices such as flexible electronics, chemical sensors and optoelectronic devices. 

    The general hypothesis for the work described in this application is that CN materials will be used in future electronic applications. The research program addresses this by conducting fundamental studies using electrical transport experiments and by taking new initiatives that aim at advancing the physics and chemistry of carbon nanotubes. More specifically, this proposal requests funding for the support of graduate students working on the electro-optical properties of SWNTs and DWNTs. The projects target two main objectives: i) new transport experiments will probe the electro-optical properties of NT field-effect transistors (CNFET) in relation to band-to-band tunneling and energy transfer phenomena. ii) Other projects target the exploration of the optical and electrical properties of chemically functionalized NTs. These experiments will test the hypothesis that new molecule-nanotube junctions can be fabricated and used as single molecule detectors. These short-term projects are defined as starting points from which new directions will be taken in the long term. Both objectives will involve the fabrication of SWNT and DWNT nanodevices using solution based CN processes developed in our lab. Other techniques either borrowed from microelectronics, surface science or molecular spectroscopy will also be used to fabricate and investigate the device and the CNs. 



      Although most of our new device ideas and hypotheses still need to be tested, they capitalize on 10 years of research experience dedicated to acquire a solid understanding on NT science and transistor properties. It also uses newly acquired knowledge and idea related to the chemical functionalization, processing and spectroscopy of CNs. These projects are multidisciplinary in nature and blend concepts borrowed from surface and interface chemistry, electronics, nanoscience, and solid-state chemistry and physics.

"Current medicine makes use of various minimally invasive surgery methods such as endoscopy and catheterization. These techniques represent a tremendous progress from traditional medicine, but many enhancements still remain possible. The insertion of such devices is usually made manually par a surgeon navigating in a complex artery network. Only easy access regions can be reached to avoid damages for healthy tissues and blood vessels. The objective of this project is to improve these interventional techniques by guiding of magnetic catheters using a clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. The magnetic fields present inside the MRI would modify the trajectory of the magnetic catheter tip in any given direction of space. The direction could be chosen in order to follow the path of an artery or to fork at a certain junction. The use of a software platform would allow pre-operation programming of the catheter course inside the arteries of the patient and then trajectory follow-up through the surgery process. Our goal is consequently to develop and install the software and hardware material necessary to the automatic guidance and tracking of magnetic catheters and to extend the range of functionalities offered by clinical MRI currently used in hospitals. The consequences of the success of such a project would have a tremendous impact on the medical field and on surgical treatment administered.

"Due to technological constraints in microfabrication coupled with limits in electrical energy sources and conversions that can be embedded in future fully autonomous untethered microrobots only a few hundreds micrometers in overall length, the energy requirement collected through embedded photovoltaic cells is minimized by exploiting the motility of flagellated MC-1 Magnetotactic Bacteria (MTB). The encapsulation of such bacteria in special micro-reservoirs embedded in the microrobot provides the mean of propulsion. Directional control of the microrobot is achieved from an onboard microcircuit inducing a torque on a chain of single domain magnetic nanoparticles called magnetosomes embedded in each bacterium. Integrated 3D coil solenoids based on standard CMOS technology are used to generate local magnetic fields to orient the swimming directions of the bacteria inside the micro-reservoirs.Although the possibilities and advantages of this method have been shown by our group through simple experiments where the controlled manipulation of microbeads was performed by MTB, additional fundamental issues and techniques related to its use for the conception of Magnetotactic Bacteria-based Systems (MBS) must be investigated. This is the main fundamental motivation for this proposal.The longer term objective is to implement instrumentation based on a new paradigm where swarms of instrumented microrobots would be mixed with the sample itself. Through collective behaviour and swarm intelligence, some types of relatively complex tasks could be performed without any infrastructures while maintaining electrical energy within each microrobot to a minimum and within constraints dictated by technology and the rules of physics.This research initiative is significant with great potential impact for researchers involved in this field since it proposes to push further the development of smaller microrobots through a new controlled micro-actuation method based on MTB with potential integration since it is low powered (low voltage) and independent to dielectric properties as opposed to other known methods used in modern engineered microsystems.

"This research program will extend the basic knowledge on several series of chemical reactions which have implications in atmospheric chemistry, in particular the problems of stratospheric ozone depletion and global warming.  The reactions can be generally categorized as decompositions of halocarbons, haloethers and haloalcohols.  In general, I will look at unimolecular decompositions involving loss of HX (X = F, Cl, or OH) and degradation via hydrogen abstraction by OH radicals.  Structures, vibrational frequencies, and energetics will be calculated using density functional theory.  The topology of the electron distribution will be examined using Atoms in Molecules theory.

      Complementary to this, I will undertake testing of theoretical methods to ascertain which ones give the best results for different calculated quantities, on the various classes of reactions studied. Testing will also be done using large thermodynamic data sets for comparisons. 

      Fundamental questions to be answered by this research include:  Why do these reactions proceed the way they do?  Why do certain theoretical methods outperform others?

"This proposal addresses two broad themes of large systems integration: a) Real-time operation of extended electric power grids and b) Coordination of interdependent multiple infrastructures during large emergencies. Large systems integration is of critical current importance as systems become more distributed and interdependent. Energy expansion (e.g. gas, wind, solar) will come from diverse ownerships and will be interdependent on other infrastructures (e.g., transportation, telecommunications, financial). Transmission capacity limitations will require operation under tighter, more coordinated operational limits, while at the same time allowing for more local intelligent actions to prevent cascading effects.

  Maintaining the integrity of the national fabric of infrastructures (power grid, telecommunications system, water system, health system, transportation system, etc.) both during normal and emergency times is becoming increasingly complex as infrastructures become more interdependent on each other and problems in one infrastructure are likely to cascade into the others. Large disasters (earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, etc.) threaten lives and the national fabric of infrastructures. Similarly, production and financial interdependencies can lead to unforeseen economic disasters.

  Four research areas are discussed in the proposal:

1) Real-time power systems operational limits assessment at power system control centres.

2) Online local assessment and control at power system substations.

3) Online condition monitoring of power system equipment.

4) Real-time critical infrastructures coordination.","Electrical energy","Energy resources","Electrical and Computer Engineering","Marti, Jose","RGPIN ","Power systems","Electrical and electronic engineering","G�nie �lectrique et �lectronique",1-5

"Engineering and science research programs that involve natural processes and landforms require accurate measurement of displacements.  These measurements are traditionally made using survey equipment and photography, and are often carried out from the air.  Commercial air-borne satellite technology has revolutionized landform mapping but is cost prohibitive for university-based research.  Ground-based Radar Interferometry is a new technology that allows the remote monitoring of movements of large portions with sub-millimetre accuracy.  This sensitivity in detecting small displacements is due to measuring the phase differences of the radar waves (interferometry) reflected from each point.  Each sub-millimetre displacement gives rise to a phase difference of the reflected wave, detectable by radar.



The IBIS ground-based Radar equipment consists of a portable scanning system.  The GRAPeS software requested will greatly enhance the value of the data collected, and will provide a means of correlating the data with digital elevation models.



The software requested will be used to support research programs that : analyze landslide dynamics, evaluate rive ice-jams, assess the stability of slope walls in open pit mines, evaluate the impact of changes in the northern climate on existing infrastructure and assess the deformations of structural members (e.g., bridge girders).  The software requested will also be used to train both graduate and undergraduate students.

"Damage evolution in strain weakening rocks is a gradual or rapid loss of strength that ultimately leads to rupture.  In underground rock engineering this brittle failure process is commonly referred to as spalling.  As the depths of underground excavations increase, and the proposed construction of underground nuclear waste disposal tunnels at depths of 300 to 700 m moves closer to reality, this form of brittle failures is taking on considerable importance.   Significant progress has been made in understanding the initiation of this failure progress in rock masses, through extensive field monitoring, mainly at dedicated underground research facilities for the geological disposal of nuclear waste.  Building on these findings, the applicant proposes to undertake a research program aimed at developing a methodology for tunnel design when this form of failure is encountered.  The results from the findings will be evaluated using carefully controlled in-situ field experiments by nuclear waste agencies in Canada, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland.  



The results from this research will enable both nuclear waste and civil industries to develop rational design approaches for underground excavations subjected to spalling.

"Damage to the hippocampus prevents the formation of new long term memories in humans and prevents the encoding of spatial maps in rats.  A compromised hippocampus also occurs in patients with Alzheimer's disease.  Failure to store information may occur because the person lacks the capacity to create a good spatial-temporal map for new events.

My research analyzes the fundamental processes that are involved in the formation of spatial maps.  This work is being carried out in rats.  I examine the formation of maps in appetitive situations where the rats are searching out the location of food.  I also examine the formation of maps in aversive situations where rats are searching for the location of a hidden platform that allows them to escape from water.  The current work examines the factors that contribute to rats knowing where they are in their environment based upon their capacity to path integrate.  Path integration is an extremely important computational process that allows an organism to keep track of its position relative to the starting point of its trip by using information about its own movement.  Path integration is also important because it is believed to underlie the formation of spatial maps.  My research also examines how path integration interacts with memory processes and how traveling through an environment enables a rat to become oriented.  

My approach contributes to our understanding of a fundamental cognitive process and to the development of a unified theory of spatial learning and memory.  Understanding the processes that go into spatial learning and memory enables us to provide better models of cognitive dysfunction and, ultimately, to ameliorate those dysfunctions in humans.  This benefits Canadians because drug treatments that are devised to help people are only effective and safe if we understand the processes that these drugs influence.

This makes them appealing as sensitive detectors and tools for understanding basic quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, Rydberg atoms normally decay very rapidly -- within a thousandth of a second - limiting their usefulness.  There is, however, a special type of Rydberg atom, known as a ""circular"" Rydberg atom, which shows very long decay times; it can be made to last for almost a second.  In the experiments with the requested equipment we will produce long-lived circular Rydberg atoms and study a technique for making them less sensitive to electric fields, while retaining their other exaggerated properties.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge","Physics and Astronomy","Martin, James","EQPEQ ","Atomic and molecular studies",Physics,Physique,1-1

"The ZEUS experiment operated from 1992 to 2007  at the electron-proton collider, HERA, the world's most powerful ``electron microscope'', at the DESY Laboratory in Germany. A grant of $9.2M from NSERC enabled the Canadian ZEUS team to make two vital contributions to the experimental apparatus: a sophisticated array of 10-tonne calorimeter modules which measure the energy of particles emerging from the interactions, and an advanced on-line parallel processor system to filter the enormous data flow and select interesting physics collisions for analysis. The Canadian team has also provided a calorimeter to measure forward scattered neutrons and new wire chambers to better measure particle trajectories.



In progress is a broad range of unique studies in particle physics, culminating so far in over 150 publications. The Canadian group has made important contributions to the physics analyses supporting these publications, which contribute in great detail to our understanding of the internal structure of the proton and the strong force of nature as revealed through the high energy interaction of electrons with the quarks and gluons in the proton. The investment by NSERC in ZEUS and HERA has so far enabled almost 50 postgraduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and many undergraduates, from 4 Canadian universities to undertake research training in particle physics at ZEUS.



The physics potential has been greatly enhanced by a large increase in the collision rate at HERA for the last few years of running. The analysis of the data from this period is well underway and will continue for the next several years. It will expand our knowledge of the proton and provide important checks on our current understanding of the microscopic world, which, while remarkably impressive, is still incomplete in many fundamental aspects. The applicants request funding for 3 years to support this final analysis period of ZEUS.

"Oil sands deposits of Northern Alberta contain an estimated 1.7 trillion barrels of oil in the form of bitumen, representing among the largest reserves of crude oil in the world. Recent acceleration of their development has resulted in their accounting for a major fraction of Canada's total energy production today and it is estimated that total production from oil sands will be 2-3 million barrels per day by 2020. For every 1 barrel of oil produced by surface mining, between 2 and 5 barrels of freshwater are required and only a small fraction of this is returned to natural systems. This is because oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) is acutely toxic to aquatic organisms and, therefore, must be retained on-site in engineered settling ponds for decades. To keep pace with the booming industry, new OSPW reclamation options are needed to accelerate their remediation and to reduce the net pressures on freshwater resources. The toxic constituents of OSPW are a complex mixture of naturally occurring organic compounds that are co-extracted from the oil sands - naphthenic acids (NAs). Using a highly specific and sensitive analytical method we will i) characterize how NAs slowly degrade by microbial activity in OSPW, ii) apply and assess the effectiveness of advanced oxidation techniques to destroy the toxic and biologically-persistent NA fractions, and iii) ensure that advanced oxidized NAs in OSPW are less toxic to aquatic organisms, including fish. Preliminary results show great promise that this strategy can be effective, and by working closely with the industry we ensure a rapid translation of new knowledge into practice. This improved OSPW remediation strategy will strengthen and sustain Canada's energy industry to continue generating wealth and creating employment for Canadians while simultaneously protecting the fragile boreal ecosystems of Northern Alberta that support human and environmental health.",Environment,Environment,"Laboratory Medicine and Pathology","Martin, Jonathan","STPGP ","Waste water treatment","Environmental engineering","G�nie de l'environnement",3-3

"I am developing magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques to study the central nervous system (CNS) in mice. In particular, I am developing and using high-resolution techniques capable of visualizing changes smaller than (100 um)^3 inside living brains. To overcome the inherent limited signal of MR methods, faster pulse sequences are used to collect the images, and produce images with higher signal-to-noise.

The mouse has become the laboratory mammal of choice for studying the basic biology of mammalian systems, for creating models of human disease and for testing new therapeutic approaches in these models largely because of the availability of sophisticated methods for genetic manipulation. Non-invasive imaging technologies can provide a window into the biology of the living mouse, affording the unique possibility of making repeated measurements of biologic function and specific molecular or genetic events within a single animal over time. A number of groups, including mine, have been developing high-resolution imaging technologies designed around the mouse with the goal of integrating the opportunities created through research in mouse biology and genetics with the power of non-invasive or non-destructive imaging at the organ or whole-mouse level.

I am collaborating in high-resolution studies of mouse CNS with scientists across Canada and envision my five-year program to be the continued development of novel imaging methods for the study of mouse models as collaborations continue to be formed. The Winnipeg experimental animal MR lab, for which I have received CFI funding for a major upgrade, is an excellent laboratory for forging such collaborations because many researchers from across Canada already use the facility, sometimes in collaboration with me or other MR physicists. In fact, through this lab, I have recently established collaborations with scientists from St. Boniface Research Centre, McGill University, the National Research Council Canada Institute for Biodiagnostics, and the University of Saskatchewan.

"Bacteria experience rapid and extreme changes in their surrounding environment and survive these changes by adapting. The major goal of this research is to understand the cellular responses that allow the bacterium to adapt to changes in the environment. To survive in these different environments Salmonella enterica, a common cause of food poisoning, utilizes a senor system that uses phosphoryl groups to relay messages inside the cell that activate coping mechanisms that cause new proteins to be made.  

    )	We study the Cpx 2-component signal transduction system. It helps bacteria cope by modulating cell envelope-related processes and expression of cell surface components, such as pili and flagella, which are important mediators of bacterium-environment interactions.  A Cpx-regulated protein, RdoA, was recently shown by our lab to play a significant part in relaying the Cpx response, and this proposal examines the role of RdoA as a serine/threonine protein kinase.  RdoA is a novel, previously uncharacterized protein that is conserved in a large number of pathogenic bacteria.

    )	To characterize the role of RdoA in cell survival we will use a wide range of techniques that can be divided into 3 general approaches.  One is to biochemically characterize the autophosphorylating and kinase activities of RdoA using site-directed mutagenesis to identify key functional residues. We will also identify the target(s) of RdoA kinase activity by characterizing the proteins that rely on RdoA to become phosphorylated.  Lastly, we will determine the extent to which the Cpx response relies on RdoA function. These studies will serve as an excellent training experience for both undergraduate and graduate students and will contribute to our understanding of an important bacterium that affects all Canadians through the quality of their food.

"Where does biodiversity come from, and why does it vary across the globe? These are important questions to answer before we can accurately predict the future impacts of human activities on the world. The long-term goal of my research program is to better understand (I) how new species form, (II) when and how these new species expand their distributions to coexist with one another, and (III) the causes of broad geographic variation in diversity. (I) To study how new species form, we will examine one of the newest species of bird to evolve - the Golden-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla) - and the traits that keep this species distinct from its closest relative, the White-crowned Sparrow (Z. leucophrys). Using experiments in aviaries, we will ask females which species they prefer, and what traits they use to make their decision. We will then use cross-fostering experiments - where one species is raised by the other - to test the hypothesis that choice of mates is based on imprinting on their parents at an early age. (II) Once new species form, they may take a long time before they actually come to coexist with one another. We will examine the progression from species formation to coexistence together in warblers (Parulidae: Dendroica) occurring in eastern Canada. Using genetic data to estimate how long ago species separated, we will examine their spatial distributions, ecology and behavioural interactions and how these change with the amount of time since divergence. (III) The cause of the latitudinal increase in diversity towards the equator is one of the greatest unsolved questions in biology. We are studying how patterns of evolution vary with latitude, specifically examining why we see evidence for faster rates of evolution at higher latitudes, contrary to what we might expect. We will use genetic, biogeographic, museum specimens, and old fashioned field work to test among hypotheses to explain faster evolution in high latitude birds, and further ask how this relates to latitudinal variation in rates of formation of new species. Overall, the proposed work will significantly improve our understanding of biodiversity, and will contribute to other Canadian research at the forefront of this field.

"Study of the interstellar medium (ISM) is at the root of understanding how the stellar population and the metalicity has been built up in the disk of the Milky Way and similar systems.  A closely related question is why is there still an ISM remaining in our Galaxy?  This appears to be because star formation in molecular clouds is not very efficient, because of feedback processes from the stars that are born there (outflows, winds, ionization, radiation pressure, supernovae).  Because of this feedback, the reservoir of the Galactic ecosystem, the ISM, is neither a single state nor static. Rather it is a both complex and dynamic consumable.

ISM research can be characterized as an ""information rich'' science, challenged to understand this complex system. Multifrequency analysis is required. One would like to understand from first principles the ISM cycle captured in the proposal title, and progress is palpable.  My research program using novel submm observations of dust and atomic hydrogen (HI) has thrusts designed to illuminate several stages of this cycle, including dust evolution and star formation and key but elusive poorly-understood transitional states such as when diffuse gas first passes from atomic to molecular form, and the cold dense molecular core phase just before gravitational collapse produces stars.

To enable Planck's ambitious cosmological analysis of the cosmic microwave background, my research aims to characterize the fluctuations of the contaminating Galactic foreground dust emission.

My group's research has a theoretical backbone and is fleshed out by active programs that are supplying the data required to make progress. We have invested significantly in being awarded three Key Projects using the 3.5-m Herschel Space Observatory and two with JCMT/SCUBA2 and have honed our skills analysing submm imaging of star forming regions taken with the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimetre Telescope (BLAST). In HI emission-line studies, I lead the 50 square degree DRAO Planck Deep Fields program and a complementary 760 square degree suite of surveys with the Green Bank 100-m telescope.

"Pressing scientific questions in climate and air quality will be addressed using a combination of satellite observations, aircraft and ground-based measurements, as well as a global three-dimensional model of atmospheric composition.  Emphasis will be placed on quantitative interpretation of satellite observations of ozone, aerosols, and their precursors in the troposphere (lowest 12-17 km of the atmosphere).  Tropospheric ozone is a major greenhouse gas, is a major pollutant, and largely controls the breakdown of other pollutants. Aerosols degrade health and visibility, and have a highly uncertain effect on climate. Both tropospheric ozone and aerosols can be produced locally and can be transported from afar.  Ozone and aerosol precursors include pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide which are emitted from combustion.  Specific tasks include 1) evaluate and improve satellite observations of ozone and aerosol precursors through comparison with aircraft and ground-based measurements, 2) provide top-down constraints on emissions of ozone and aerosol precursors through inverse modeling of satellite observations, and 3) evaluate and improve the representation of aerosol processes in global models.  Achieving these objectives would reduce uncertainty in critical atmospheric processes that impair current efforts to improve air quality and respond to climate change.","Climate and atmosphere",Environment,"Physics and Atmospheric Science","Martin, Randall","RGPIN ","Atmospheric chemistry (including air pollution)","Atmospheric science","�tude de l'atmosph�re",1-5

"In broad terms, I focus on the mineralogy and petrology of crustal rocks, in particular those rocks formed in an extensional tectonic environment. I document what the magma produced, and how an aqueous phase exsolved from the melt or from outside interacts with the just-formed hot rocks as they cool and contract. Evolved igneous rocks like granites, nepheline syenites and carbonatites commonly involve a mixed crust + mantle provenance, which can best be evaluated using isotope geochemistry. The hydrothermal mobility of high-field-strength elements like Ta, Zr and Ti remains a contested area, and requires much more documentation in field-based studies. More basic rocks also bear the hydrothermal imprints, and mobility in those cases may well involve the platinum-group elements, of great economic importance. Field studies will focus on the Bancroft area of Ontario, the classic anorogenic Younger Granites of Nigeria, the granitic pegmatites of the Borborema Province, Brazil, and of Catalunya, Spain, the catazonal rocks of southern Madagascar, and the alkaline rocks of the Monteregian Province of Quebec. The crust also bears the imprint of localized impact-generated melting; a project on the Clearwater Lake craters in northern Quebec will shed light on the remelting of the metamorphic Archean basement and the limestone cover in the area. Many of the research projects address topics at the ""cutting edge"", about processes that shaped of crust of the Earth. At the same time, they touch on economic aspects, in particular those studies that address the platinum-group elements and the high field-strength elements, and thus have the potential of an impact on the optimization of mineral exploration for those commodities in Canada and elsewhere.

"Traditionally, plant derived nutritional supplements have predominated the market. Nevertheless, with the

dramatic increase in profitability within the nutraceutical and functional food markets, new environments are

being investigated. Recently, the sea has begun to show promise as an abundant, hitherto untapped source of

nutraceuticals. Marine microorganisms, in particular, represent a relatively neglected source of extracts and

natural products derived from marine macroalgae, microalgae, cyanobacteria, bacteria and fungi. Coenzyme

Q10 (CoQ10), a benzoquinone compound with ten isoprenoid units, is a product of interest to the nutraceutical

market. CoQ10 is the only ubiquinone found in humans. It is an essential component of the mitochondria and

involved in the body's electron transport chain which produces adenosine triphosphate. Excellent therapeutic

effects of CoQ10 on various diseases have been reported, being approved as a drug in Japan for the treatment

of heart disease since 1974, as well as having various antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects which have

recently been exploited in several cosmetic products. In these roles, CoQ10 becomes a highly desired

ingredient in both the dietary supplement and cosmetic industries and therefore of particular interest to our

supporting organization.

Our proposed research aims at developing a novel bioprocess for the production of CoQ10, a food supplement

and nutraceutical with demonstrated human health benefits. Central to this bioprocess is the development of a

microbial ""biological factory"" with enhanced capacity to produce CoQ10. The starting point for genetically

engineering this factory will be both Escherichia coli and a marine bacterium. This marine bacterium is

pigmented and naturally produces elevated levels of CoQ10. By the genetic modification of these host strains

through a combination of rational metabolic pathway engineering and random mutagenesis we will raise

CoQ10 productivity and engineer platform strains that will eventually be used in a novel large scale process for

commercial CoQ10 production.

"The Canadian Pulp and Paper industry has a distinct advantage, over international competitors, in the manufacture of mechanical pulps and wood containing papers.  The advantages lie in our investment in inexpensive, reliable hydroelectric infrastructure and our slow growing northern wood species which have superior properties that support the manufacture of high value wood-containing printing grades.  These advantages, however, diminish with currently increasing cost of electrical energy. 



The vision of this work is to create novel processing stages that are energy efficient and enhance product quality. This will in turn allow Canadian manufactures to regain their competitive advantage. The specific goals of this proposal are three fold fold. In the first project an attempt is made to reduce electrical costs through understanding of flow of fibre suspensions in a pipe. Pulp mills use many pumps for conveying fibre suspensions in pipe networks and the efficiency is far from optimal due to wear and inappropriate sizing. In particular we would like to develop tools to measure the onset of turbulence in these suspensions. In the second project, we attempt to design a prototype device to efficiently fractionate papermaking fibres based on their cell wall thickness; we do so in this continuing project by use of smart fluids in which the rheology of the carrier fluid is altered . With efficient separation of the fibres before the energy intensive refining treatment, significant energy savings could be achieved.  In the third project, we attempt to develop methods to produce ""highly-filled"" papers through examination of novel papermaking methods. The engineering goal of this work is to allow Canadian manufactures to achieve radically different end use qualities of the paper through use of targeted chemical additions at different layers in the paper structure. This will allow the industry to evolve for a given fibre basket.

"Our main research program focuses on the cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal damage in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. We are analyzing the role of some oxidative and inflammatory agents in cellular degeneration and mortality. In this context, we are also interested in neuroprotective cellular mechanisms, i.e. the possibility that some steroids, particularly phytoestrogens and phytosterols, may act as anti-oxidative and/or anti-inflammatory molecules. 

Even if oxidative reactions are normal features of cellular metabolism, the production of oxidative molecules can overwhelm cellular anti-oxidative capacity, causing oxidative stress.  Recent studies support the existence of a link between oxidative stress and the complex neurodegeneration processes. We have demonstrated that several oxidative toxins such as paraquat and MPTP act as neurodegeneration mediators. Thus, we have evaluated several strategies to protect neurons and prevent neurodegeneration by reducing oxidative stress.  Interestingly, phytoestrogens are naturally-occurring molecules that may exert anti-oxidative actions in vivo and in vitro and protect against neurodegenerative diseases without causing secondary hormonal events. Our results show that some phytoestrogens, such as resveratrol, quercetin, and sesamin, reduce neuronal mortality induced by oxidative toxins.  In addition, we have demonstrated that these natural occurring molecules can play an important anti-inflammatory role. Finally, our results may open doors to the rational design of neuroprotective anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agents with decreased hormonal side effects.

"Climate change has made aircraft greenhouse emissions the most critical issue constraining the growth of commercial aviation. Currently, the environmental impact of aviation outpaces the improvements that are possible through incremental advances in engine and airframe design. Thus, it is widely accepted that substantial improvements to the environmental acceptability of aircraft are necessary for commercial aviation to be sustainable.



Current methodologies for designing airliners focus on achieving minimum operating cost while meeting certain performance goals. Environmental considerations are usually addressed after the configuration is frozen. As a recent example, the Airbus A380 was modified at a late stage of the design process to meet noise restrictions at Heathrow airport. The required modifications successfully decreased the noise, but resulted in a 2% increase in fuel burn that could have been mitigated, had these modifications been considered at the preliminary design stage.



One of the keys to addressing these issues is the use of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO), which is now poised to make a significant impact on industry. The proposed research will address this problem by using the latest advances in MDO to consider environmental impact earlier in the design process. This research will: (1) Develop a high-fidelity design tool that integrates the emissions and other environmental considerations at the aircraft conceptual and preliminary design stages; (2) Quantify the trade-off between environmental impact and economic performance by finding optimal aircraft configurations; (3) Find novel aircraft configurations that exhibit very low environmental impact. In particular, unconventional aircraft configurations such as blended-wing bodies, oblique wings and non-planar wings will be explored.

"Optical coating (OCs) applications represent a worldwide market of more than 5 billion US dollars annually; they range from antireflective (AR) coatings found in most optical components to narrowband optical interference filters used in telecommunications, astronomy and other instruments and devices. As the range of applications of OCs continuously broadens and extremely attractive market opportunities arise, it is becoming increasingly important to develop new deposition methods and thin film materials with multifunctional properties, and to optimize the functional performance of the thin film devices (including the mechanical and electrical characteristics and long term stability).



In this context, the new deposition technique, namely the High Power Pulsed Magnetron Sputtering (HPPMS), offers a unique opportunity that will be explored in the proposed project: due to a very high plasma density within individual discharge pulses, leading to the formation of a ""metal plasma"" characterized by high ion fluxes and high ion/neutral flux ratios, this deposition method gives rise to films with essentially bulk density values, low stress, high hardness and environmental stability, and numerous other advantageous functional properties. At the same time, the HPPMS process is fully compatible with the current OC fabrication systems, an aspect that can substantially facilitate technology transfer to the OC sector.

"Optical coating applications represented a worldwide market of 4.3 billion US dollars in 2005; they range from antireflective coatings found in most optical components to narrowband optical interference filters used in telecommunications. While most current applications require that the optical properties of the materials are passive (their properties do not change with applied conditions), there exists much interest to develop new applications such as thin film security devices, sensors and filters for instrumentation based on active materials. In the present project, we propose to develop new active anti-counterfeiting devices whose appearance changes when applying external actuation, as well as all-optical thin film sensors based on nanostructure-controlled porous materials applied to optical fibers. Part of this project will be devoted to the development of a physical model that simultaneously takes into account the multifunctional properties (including mechanical, optical and others) of individual films and allows one to predict and design the performance of environmentally stable optical filters, such as those used in astronomy.

"The intertidal zone of wave-swept rocky shores is among the most physically stressful habitats on the planet.  At low tide, seaweeds are exposed to terrestrial conditions and must resist temperature and desiccation stresses. At high tide, crashing waves impose hydrodynamic forces that threaten to break or dislodge algae from the rocks. Despite this adversity, rocky shores support rich and morphologically diverse communities of macroalgae. 



Research in my lab explores the biomechanical, morphological and physiological adaptations of seaweeds to physical stressors, such as wave-induced drag force. Experiments test adaptive hypotheses at multiple scales of analysis, from cell wall chemistry, through tissue composition, to whole organism performance. At the cell wall level, experiments explore the chemical composition of macroalgal cell walls and document the molecular basis for the mechanical properties that help seaweeds resist wave forces. For example, lignin stiffens cell walls in many land plants, helping them grow upright in air, but the molecule has never before been described in algae; our recent discovery of lignin in an intertidal alga suggests that it may also play a mechanical role on wave-swept shores. At the organism level, studies use a high speed recirculating water flume to correlate the behavior of flexible fronds with the forces they experience in flow. Further studies test whether frond morphology changes in response to experimentally-manipulated environmental factors. In sum, these experiments examine the biomechanical adaptations and functional morphology of marine algae that may have been shaped by selective pressures imposed by the physical environment. Exploring a broad range of intertidal algae at multiple scales of analysis, my lab's integrated approach seeks to explain how evolution has orchestrated the morphological diversity of seaweeds we see today.

"Thermal processing is recognized as a major source of quality degradation of heat-sensitive foods, resulting in almost 95% loss of natural vitamins and bioactive components (Sun, 2006). The challenge of maintaining both quality and safety in thermal processing depends on our understanding of mechanisms of quality degradation. Due to the number of physical and biochemical mechanisms involved, there is a gap in our knowledge of temperature-induced quality degradation. Although the sensory evaluation of quality is appropriate and may be the most accurate method, sensory panels are not always available for routine, large-scale evaluation of food quality. The tremendous resolution of computer vision has opened the way for real-time imaging of food quality degradation. However, the use of computer vision for real-time imaging of food quality has been limited because of the difficulties in interpretation of quality indicators from digital images. 

      The objective of this proposed research is to establish relationships between food quality indicators and morphological, colour and textural attributes of digital images. A high-resoluton computer vision system will be used for real-time imaging of heat-sensitive food. Simultaneous multi-spectral imaging of colour and temperature in the process of heating will add considerable knowledge to our current understanding of temperature-induced quality degradation. This technology is not in common use and its development will create opportunities for research and industrial applications of ""smart"" engineering tools in the food industry.

"This research is an extension of my earlier work in digital terrain analysis and aims to improve our understanding and ability to model the impact of surface depressions on streamflow. One of the distinctive features of the low-relief landscapes of Canada west of the Rocky Mountains is the wide-spread occurence of shallow, surface depressions produced by glacial and periglacial processes. In the Canadian Prairies, these depressions are often called Prairie potholes or sloughs. They provide environmentally-important wetland sites and exert a significant control on streamflow and groundwater regimes. The size and frequency of surface depressions can vary greatly across the landscape. They are often linked by drainage courses along which water flows only when the storage capacity of the depressions is filled. Water spilling from filled depressions represents a hydrological threshold shift with catchment areas and streamflow volumes often changing dramatically. The potential significance of surface depression storage to regional hydrologic and climatic processes is illustrated by the South Saskatchewan River Basin where scientists estimate that over 50% of the landscape rarely contributes runoff to the major river system because of the interuption of drainage courses by sloughs and potholes. The objectives of this research are to (1) characterize the major features of the complex, inter-depressional flow patterns found in much of the Canadian Praires, (2) modify the standard algorithms used in digital terrain analysis to appropriately represent this pattern in local-scale hydrological models and (3) develop up-scaling techniques to allow our improved understanding of this system to be used effectively in regional scale hydrological models. While this research will focus particularly on the hydrological impact of surface depressions in Prairie landscapes, its outcomes will also have application in areas like the Canadian Shield and northern tundra where surface depressions are also an important element of the landscape.

"In large-scale distributed real-time embedded systems, there are periodic and aperiodic processes driven by messages that affect the system's performance. Due to limitations of the resources in embedded systems, message-based designs impose significant overheads and degrade system performance, because of high execution time and memory requirements. 



The mechanisms for defining and addressing these issues in order to achieve quality of service are still maturing. Current architectures are not perfect and are still in their infancy in addressing these issues in large distributed systems. This research program will provide a benchmark for the current demands of industry and the research community. In the proposed approach, overheads are removed and communication delays are minimized, resulting in significant improvement in performance of real-time embedded and distributed systems.

"Quantum Information (QI) is a radically new way to communicate and process information. It is based on the laws of quantum mechanics which apply to atoms and light pulses that carry a minimal amount of energy and are called photons. Ordinary information technology processes bits that take either the value zero or one, but QI allows parallel processing of ""qubits"" that take all logical values simultaneously. This can be exploited for provably secure communication and a dramatic reduction in complexity of, e.g., search algorithms.



Optical QI faces two major challenges. First, all-optical QI needs a device in which one photon can influence another photon. Because these light pulses are so faint this is difficult to achieve, but recent progress on gene- rating ""giant optical nonlinearities"" has brought us closer to its realization. Another challenge is the construc- tion of a ""quantum repeater"" which may enable quantum communication through optical fibers beyond the current limit of about 70 km distance. An essential part of a repeater is a ""quantum memory"" to store qubits. 



In our research project we will address both challenges. First, we will investigate two new ways to increase the influence of one photon on another. (i) Light near a thin metal layer can induce waves of charges which can increase the light's intensity and thus make it easier for photons to interact. We will study if this method is suitable despite the losses induced by the metal. (ii) Using a clever sequence of laser pulses it is possible to blow up atoms to a much larger size. Such ""Rydberg atoms"" can interact strongly even if they are relatively far apart from each other, and we will try to find a way to convert this interaction into an interaction between photons. Furthermore, we will extend our research program on building a quantum memory by searching for new ways to store photons in a gas of atoms or an ion-doped optical fiber by slowly changing control parameters such as an applied voltage or an additional laser beam.

"The current research proposal is focused on the development and optimization of a new Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) for offshore concrete and steel infrastructure for the harsh North Atlantic Environment. The project objective is to identify the appropriate structural health monitoring system components suitable for the harsh North Atlantic. The SHM is an emerging important tool for diagnosing deterioration, damage detection, maintenance and management of civil infrastructures. 

Concrete offshore structures are built using thick high strength concrete plates. The crack control of offshore concrete structure sustained under service loads will be investigated. A SHM system with various types of sensors will be recommended for a new offshore structure for monitoring the in-service performance. However, a novel acoustic or wave transmission technique will be investigated for tracking concrete damage in an existing concrete offshore. The possible methods that can be used efficiently for detecting cracks in thick heavily reinforced offshore concrete plates are acoustic emission, impact echo and shear wave techniques. The suitability of each will be assessed for offshore monitoring. The techniques are based on identification of changes in acoustic or wave form attenuation through concrete by comparing integrated wave form amplitudes recorded by two or more sensors. 

The multichannel random decrement method will be applied for a steel offshore hull to extract the modal properties of the structural component and identify the damage existence and location. The best locations to excite a steel offshore hull structural component will be determined and a repair strengthens technique will be recommended using the general structural assessment principles. The neural network technique can be used in combination with the random decrement technique or data scan or wave scan to detect damages in offshore structures.

"The current research proposal is focused on the development and optimization of a new crack design criteria and minimum reinforcement suitable for high strength concrete with thick concrete cross sections, thick concrete covers, large diameter reinforcement and relatively high reinforcement ratios. Offshore structures are exposed to harsh environmental conditions, including exposure to seawater and sea spray or the structure's existence in the splash zone. An accurate estimate of the crack width and steel reinforcement can result in saving estimated to be in millions of dollars for a single platform. Most of the available expressions for crack width calculations were developed for building structures using normal strength concrete and normal concrete cover. However, offshore structures are built using high strength concrete with thick concrete sections up to 500 mm with 50 - 60 mm concrete cover. Very little research information is published on the crack analysis of high strength concrete with thick concrete section and large concrete cover used for offshore applications. The proposed numerical phase of the investigation will examine mechanisms associated with tension and flexure cracking. Other factors that affect crack width and spacing of cracks under sustained service loads will be examined. Previous important investigations conducted by the applicant on high strength concrete for offshore applications will be utilized to evaluate accurately the cracking properties of offshore structures. 



High strength concrete reinforced with glass fiber reinforcement (GFRP) bars has great potential for offshore applications. The utilization of glass bars in panel-type structures requires better understanding of its cracking and tensile behaviour. The use of a non-corrosive material for concrete reinforcement will improve the structure durability and will provide great economical advantage. The current investigation will examine concrete plates reinforced with GFRP bars under uniaxial, biaxial and flexure loads. A constitutive relationship that can describe the response of the GFRP-reinforced concrete panels is being investigated.

"Funding is requested for a state-of-the-art variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometer system to replace a 20 year-old obsolete system. The ellipsometer is manufactured by J.A. Woollam Co., Inc., one of the world-leaders in the development and fabrication of high resolution ellipsometers with an outstanding reliability record. It will cover a wavelength range from the ultra-violet to the near-infrared, from 245 to 1690 nm. 



Spectroscopic ellipsometry is one of the most powerful techniques to determine a number of important physical characteristics of complex materials structures. These include film and/or layer thickness(es), composition - both in-film and as a function of depth, uniformity, surface roughness, crystallinity, and most importantly, the complex dielectric function as a function of wavelength, which yields the refractive index and the absorption characteristics. It is also suitable to investigate interfaces in multilayer systems, an area normally reserved for electron microscopy. The proposed instrument will complement an existing ellipsometer operating in the near- to mid-infrared (1.6 to 30�m), by the same manufacturer.



The research to be supported by the acquisition of the proposed system is multi-disciplinary, spanning applications from stamdard semiconductor technology to silicon-based light emitters and to photovoltaics. In many cases, the proposed instrument's versatility and range of operation are critical to determining materials characteristics that are not otherwise accessible.","Manufacturing processes and products","Manufacturing processes and products","Engineering Physics","Mascher, Peter","EQPEQ ","Thin films/interface","Materials science and technology","Science et technologie des mat�riaux",1-1
"This proposal is concerned with the comprehensive characterization of complex materials structures to (a) obtain a better understanding of the microscopic processes determining their properties, (b) aid in their optimization for photonic and - to a lesser extent - electronic applications, and (c) provide feedback to the fabrication and processing stage. 



The proposed research program builds on the demonstrated successes of previous research projects and will further intensify our work in (a) Silicon photonics, including rare-earth doped structures; (b) CdTe nanostructures and thin films; and (c) Complex perovskite structures. Common to all these materials systems is the complexity of their physical and chemical make-up and the tendency to incorporate impurities and/or defects, all of which determine the optical and electronic properties. We will place particular emphasis on synergistic use of complementary analytical tools to be able to link microscopic and/or structural features to optical and/or electronic properties of the investigated systems. This will be accomplished by making use of the state-of-the-art facilities available in the Canadian Centre for Electron Microscopy, the Brockhouse Institute for Materials Research, and the Centre for Emerging Device Technologies, all located at McMaster, the McMaster and Western Ontario Positron Laboratories, and the synchrotron facility at the Canadian Light Source in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

   

Applications of the above described materials systems can be found in telecommunications and lighting (silicon photonics), non-linear optical components and photovoltaics (CdTe nanostructures), and dielectric resonators for wireless technologies (Ba-based perovskite structures).

"Complex analysis and harmonic analysis are two old and closely related branches of classical analysis. Moreover, they have many applications in applied sciences and engineering. For example it is rather impossible to find an engineer who has not heard of Fourier analysis.



Model subspaces of the Hardy space H2 was the main theme of my previous NSERC research project. No doubt this subject has a variety of applications in pure and applied sciences, e.g. operator theory, control engineering and quantum physics. V. Havin and I were awarded the G. de B. Robinson prize of the Canadian Mathematical Society for publishing two long papers in the Canadian Mathematical Journal on this subject.



De Branges spaces are a generalization of model subspaces. Dirichlet spaces are another family of spaces of analytic functions with close relations to Hardy spaces. Studying these spaces is a new and highly active area of research with many interesting open questions. In particular, we would like to explore the application of these spaces in control theory, a subject that has not been touched yet. To do this we have to enrich the subject itself and obtain some necessary tools. In this project we study the derivative of functions in these spaces, their invariant subspaces under the shift operators and their zero sets.

"Wind Energy has gained significant interest in the past years among electricity producers and wind turbines are expected to be installed at a high pace for years to come. However, fewer ideal sites are available for these new installations. With construction of wind projects in sites with complex topographies, the risks associated with the success of a wind park have significantly raised. In addition to regular analyses performed during evaluation of a wind park project, the Canadian environment poses two challenges important for security of supply: (i) operation over complex terrains and (ii) atmospheric icing events. With the objective of improving the security of supply related to wind energy production in Canadian settings, the proposed research program is composed of two themes. The first theme is related to the numerical modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer at micro-scales levels over complex terrains. The second one is dedicated to the atmospheric icing climatology of Canada. The first theme main objective is an improvement of the knowledge on the art of numerical modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer over complex terrains at micro-scale levels through fundamental studies of turbulence modeling and terrain representation (resolution, ground cover representation). The simulation code, adapted from the Models for Analysis of Turbine Hydraulics (MATH) platform of Hydro-Quebec (HQ) to atmospheric flows, will be the core of a tool to evaluate the risk and uncertainties associated with a wind park project by drawing exclusion regions where wind turbines should not be installed because local flow bears undesired characteristics such as (i) presence of flow separation, (ii) high levels of turbulence and (iii) strong shear levels. The main objective of the second theme is to provide the wind energy industry with a Canadian atlas of atmospheric icing events that occurred historically, displaying averages and extreme values of parameters that describe atmospheric icing events like frequency, duration, intensity, and wind properties. This detailed information could be used to estimate the energy loss due to such events, as well as the uncertainties on the projected energy yield of a wind project.

"In most eukaryotic organisms, haploid gametes are produced from diploid parental cells by the process of meiosis. During meiosis, genetic variation is introduced by meiotic recombination where chromosomes from each parent recombine (known as inter-homolog recombination) leading to gametes with different genetic signatures. Defects in meiotic recombination can cause cells to have the wrong number of chromosomes (aneuploidy), resulting in abnormal or inviable progeny. So far, studies into the biochemistry and genetics of human meiotic recombination has been hampered by the unavailability of human tissues such as ovaries or testis. Moreover, there is no meiotic human cell line that can be used as a model for meiotic recombination. 



Hence, Dr Masson's team is using the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as an innovative model to study the biochemistry and genetics of meiotic recombination since the process of meiosis is conserved throughout evolution. The primary objective of Dr Masson's research is to understand how DNA recombination affects meiosis and lead to aneuploidy. This is of particular importance since one-third of all miscarriage are aneuploid and aneuploidy is the leading genetic cause of developmental disabilities and mental retardation.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge","Biologie m�dicale","Masson, Jean","RGPIN ",Genetics,Genetics,"G�n�tique",1-5
"The development of novel analytical methodologies is required to face the current challenges in bioanalysis. The quantification of the chemical messengers released from a single cell or a small group of cells in relation with cellular morphology will help understand the biological mechanism of diseases. However, miniaturisation of sensors is required to achieve protein quantification in the extracellular space of a single cell. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensors exhibit the potential to locally monitor proteins with spatial resolution better than the size of a cell. Hence, our research will focus on developing a micro-plasmonic sensor exhibiting a strong SPR response to proteins. The integration of the SPR micro-biosensor on the tip of an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) cantilever will enable the simultaneous measurement of proteins in the extracellular space above cells and cellular morphology. We will apply ""scanning probe SPR microscopy"" to a model system. A chemokine is a messenger protein. They have been recently identified as a major contributor to the signalling mechanism regulating cancer growth and metastasis. However, it remains unknown how chemokines migrate and infect other cells.  Thus, we aim at utilising scanning probe SPR microscopy for the quantification of the chemokine gradient from cancerous to healthy cells. To reach our objectives, we will focus on the optimisation of the response of SPR micro-biosensors to chemokines by optimising various experimental parameters: the cantilever material and geometry, the composition and the thickness of the metal thin film (Au or Ag) supporting the SPR micro-biosensor, and the data analysis method. Conventional SPR sensors will also be optimised to maximise the response generated by low concentration of chemokines in cell culture media samples. The sensors will be specifically applied to monitor the chemokine CXCL12. This chemokine of importance is involved in the biological mechanism of breast cancer metastasis.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge",Chimie,"Masson, JeanFran�ois","RGPIN ","Bioanalytical chemistry","Analytical chemistry","Chimie analytique",2-3

"Our aim is to create new market opportunities for Canada's agricultural and forest industries by generating novel biomaterials that combine the reactivity of polymers extracted from agricultural residues and the strength properties of cellulose from wood fibres. This project combines necessary expertise from academia, research institutes and industry to deliver a highly integrated and effective research plan with specific process and product deliverables. Our objectives for this 3-year program are to: i) optimize and scale-up procedures to extract xylan from underutilized agricultural residues that are abundant in Canada, including corn fibre, wheat bran and oat hull residuals; ii) harness the specificity of biocatalysts to alter the surface properties and reactivity of these natural polymers, and iii) graft engineered xylan polymers onto cellulose fibre surfaces for production of novel biocomposite materials. Specific product targets include cellulose-based materials with high surface hydrophobicity that can displace non-renewable plastics, and cellulose-based composites with increased surface reactivity.   It is anticipated that this research will create new economic opportunities for forest and agricultural industries. This will benefit all Canadians by creating new employment opportunities, as well as by providing high-performance, and renewable alternatives to petroleum-based products.","Fibres and textiles","Manufacturing processes and products","Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry","Master, Emma","STPGP ","Forest engineering","Forest engineering","G�nie forestier",3-3
"When Henry Ford built his first car in 1896, he designed it to run on ethanol. In Germany, Rudolph Diesel built

his engines to run on peanut oil. However, with the rise of the automobile these renewable biofuels were

quickly replaced by petroleum. Presently, high energy prices, increased energy imports, concerns about

petroleum supplies, and greater recognition of the environmental consequences of fossil fuels have driven

interest in biofuels and conversion of biomass to energy. Nowadays, several enzyme-based technologies for the

production of renewable and clean energy sources, such as biodiesel, bioethanol and biohydrogen, are rapidly

emerging. Today, bioenergy accounts for approximately 15% of the energy consumption of the world and its

production is quickly growing. Despite the obvious benefits of biocatalysis, there are several major hurdles

hindering the implementation of these technologies: high production costs, low yields, low enzyme activity and

stability, and very limited repertoire of available enzymes.

Global genome and metagenome sequencing efforts uncovered millions of genes encoding novel, unknown

proteins. They represent a potentially rich source of new enzymes for the conversion of biomass to energy. The

main aim of this project is to discover novel microbial enzymes of potential importance for biodiesel

production and degradation of plant biomass. We propose to apply our high-throughput technologies of

enzymatic screening and structural proteomics to identify and quickly characterize 100 novel enzymes with a

focus on lipases and esterases, to understand the molecular basis of substrate selectivity and stability of these

enzymes, and eventually, to select several enzymes for future application in bioenergy.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","Energy resources","Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry","Master, Emma","STPGP ",Biochemistry,Biochemistry,Biochimie,3-3
"Technologies that promote the utilization of biomass and reduce the demand for petroleum feedstocks will improve environmental and political security. With roughly 68 M ha of arable land, and 10% of the World's forest, Canada has a natural advantage to become a world leader in technologies that produce sustainable energy and materials from underutilized biomass. If realized, corresponding investment would invigorate forest and agricultural industries, and create new jobs for Canadians, both knowledge-based and traditional.  While considerable attention has been placed on converting biomass to fuels and chemicals, there is a critical need to develop technologies for the production of high-value co-products, which can off-set the cost of biofuel production in the short term, and secure long-term investment in future biorefineries.  The vision of this research program is the development and application of sustainable bioprocesses for the creation of renewable and high-value biomaterials from non-consumable sources of biomass (i.e. lignocellulose).  Our mission for the next five years is to harness the potential of recent genome sequencing projects for microorganisms that transform lignocellulose, and high-throughput genomic and protein engineering platforms, to create enzymes that can be used to alter the chemical reactivity and physical properties of lignocellulose-derived polysaccharides.  In the long-term, this program will exploit the ability of enzymatically modified polysaccharides and cellulose to self-assemble, to create novel biocomposites ranging from plastic-displacing packaging to bio-active materials for high-value medical applications.

"I am most interested in problems involving interplay between several branches of mathematics.  There is an abundance of such problems involving Hopf algebras; these are algebraic structures arising in numerous parts of mathematics, as well as  in physics.  Examples of Hopf algebras include group algebras, universal envelopes of Lie algebras, algebras of representative functions on Lie groups, coordinate algebras of algebraic groups, and quantum groups.



I plan to study algebraic structure of Hopf algebras in order to classify them, construct new interesting examples, and apply them to problems in algebra, analysis, and combinatorics.  Discrete structures often give rise to natural Hopf algebras in which multiplication encodes the assembly and comultiplication encodes the disassembly of combinatorial objects under investigation.  These Hopf algebras  often enable us to see deep connections between algebra, analysis, and combinatorics.  A point in case is recent joint work in which we constructed a combinatorial Hopf algebra in order to study a free analogue of joint distributions in probability.

"Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology provides a unique alternative for the preservation of genetic material from valuable individuals and species. The use of interspecies SCNT for the production of embryos in non-domestic species is necessary due to insufficient quantities of oocytes from rare or exotic animals as recipients for the exotic donor nucleus. Poor development of these embryos to term-gestation suggests that they are developmentally compromised. Incompatibility between the donor nucleus and recipient cytoplasm is thought to play an important role in the decreased development. Our research interest lies in elucidating the mechanisms that are disrupted during interspecific nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions to identify the reasons for decreased developmental competence in the absence of technique-related problems. Studies to date have documented the importance of cytoplasmic composition and organization in SCNT embryo success. Mitochondria play a central role in cellular pathways (energy production, apoptosis) that are necessary for proper cell function. Dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, function and distribution results in alterations in mtDNA copy number, ATP levels and rates of apoptosis, all of which have been associated with early embryo arrest and death. Interactions between the cytoplasm and the nuclear genome and centrosomes, components inherited from the unrelated donor cell, are critical for maintaining normal mitochondrial activity. The proposed research will examine whether nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions involved in mitochondrial distribution and function are disrupted in interspecific SCNT embryos from evolutionarily similar cattle species. Bison (Bison bison) and domestic cattle (Bos taurus) gametes and somatic cells will be used to produce hybrid embryos using in vitro fertilization (IVF) and SCNT techniques. Analysis of these unique hybrids will give us a better understanding of the basic differences in nuclear and cytoplasmic contribution to embryo development. This is essential for the development and optimization of in vitro embryo production protocols for non-domestic species.

"Radicals are key intermediates in a number of chemical transformations and their reactivity involves two key steps: 1. Radical formation via breaking of a chemical bond, A-B, to give two highly reactive radical species A(dot) and B(dot). This step occurs spontaneously or through the application of energy in the form of heat or light; 2. Termination of the reaction and this involves the formation of a bond between two similar or dissimilar radicals, A(dot) + B(dot) to give A-B. Most of these radical reactions involve transient species. In contrast, there are some known radicals that are stable enough to be placed in a bottle on the shelf. Unfortunately, because of their stability, many of these species are not reactive enough to participate in a number of chemical transformations. However, there are a handful of compounds that contain weak or strained bonds in the solid state that either partially or fully dissociate in solution through breaking of the element-element bond.  These form persistent radicals--i.e. a radical that has a very long lifetime, but is not ""bottle-able"".

In the proposed research, our research group will be studying the reactivity of these persistent, phosphorus-based radicals that have intermediate stability. Their reactivity with common small molecules will be investigated and compared and contrasted to that of chlorine, bromine and other common radical forming species. Once reactivity trends have been established, new, metal-based radicals (such as aluminum) will be investigated.These studies will further the understanding of radical reactivity which may have implications in fundamental science or industry/pharmaceuticals.

Research will be carried out by a combination of masters and undergraduate students. This research will provide training, combining both theory and practical skills, that will be beneficial to the student for future prospects in graduate/professional school or in chemical industry. An inert atmosphere glovebox is essential for the synthesis of these sensitive sensitive compounds and the success of my research program.

"This research project will correlate the interests of Anatis Bioprotection with those of the research group in

Enzymology and Biocompatible Polymers at UQAM. Anatis is working on the development of a bioinsecticide

based on conidiospores of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. The powder of these spores

presents several limitations, such as: reduced shelf life and dust production, lower safety and some difficulties

to package, transport and use. At UQAM, the group of Pr. Mateescu is involved in biomaterials and

pharmaceutical excipients since almost 20 years.

The present project proposes the formulation of B. Bassiana spores to optimize this newly developed

biopesticide with three starch based excipients that will be used and compared: a recently patented homemade

carboxymethyl starch (CMS), a commercial cross-linked carboxymethyl starch (Primojel�) and a commercial

pregelatinized starch (Colorcon). Moreover, the compatibility with a clay, a sunscreen (skimmed milk) and two

potential wetting agents (Tween 80 or PolyVinylAlcohol [PVA]) will be evaluated for the final formulations.

After a fast spray drying, rolling compaction and extrusion, the granules will be first evaluated by in vitro

disintegration and by spore viability at UQAM in collaboration with Anatis. Infectivity in greenhouse will be

monitored by Anatis for each formulation produced at UQAM. Further characterisation of the matrices will be

conducted at UQAM by scanning electron microscopy and by X-ray diffraction. For the CMS, the degree of

substitution, the protonation ratio, the rate of dissolution and drying procedure will be tested to generate useful

knowledge for further applications.

The proposed formulation is expected to ensure high efficacy and storage stability of B. Bassiana, and

improve the acceptability by regulatory agencies, particularly by reducing allergenic risk of the spore powder.","Agricultural chemicals (fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides)","Manufacturing processes and products",Chimie,"Mateescu, MirceaAlexandru","EGP   ","Agricultural engineering","Agricultural engineering","G�nie rural",1-1

"Environmental disturbances that can negatively  affect natural ecosystems and human societies are many, with current public attention focussed primarily on climate changes, and sometimes on epsiodic events like earthquakes and tsunamis.  My research program since 1976 continues to emphasize studying past occurrences (over thousands of years) of environmental impacts in Western Canada, with the aim of better understanding the long-term effects of disturbances such as climate changes, earthquakes, forest fires and volcanic eruptions, and using this knowledge to help predict future impacts on natural systems.  My collaborators and students work with me on a variety of research projects that all provide information on vegetation changes associated with past disturbances. Since vegetation is a good ""proxy"" for climatic conditions, past changes in temperature and moisture can often be reconstructed from fossil plant data. Such paleo-data can help check the accuracy of computer-based climate models and provides long time series for recurring climate changes in the atmosphere and oceans.  These data are also important in the management of parks, forestry, fisheries, and cultural resources as well as providing an environmental context for investigations of First Nations history.



The research proposed here is designed to provide new insights into events like  earthquake frequency in southern B.C., plant cover changes and climate during the last Ice Age in the Yukon and B.C., and causes of extinctions of large grazing animals such as mammoths, horses, and giant bison in Canada. High-resolution studies covering the past 1,000 years are expected to detect patterns of rapid climate change from annually layered sediments and peat bogs. These will provide greater details of rapid environmental changes in Western Canada, and also contribute to international research objectives into climate variability.

"The proposed research  project  is in  the area of conformal field theory - a two-dimensional quantum field theory invariant under the conformal group - which  has applications in string theory, statistical models (critical point) and  condensed matter physics. The main  line of research is to provide a quasi-particle formulation of conformal field theories. In such a framework, the Hilbert space is described  by filling the space of states  by quasi-particles subject to restriction rules that generalize the Pauli exclusion principle. This method produces many novel character formulae (the generating functions for states), which are of great intrinsic mathematical interest (e.g., new generalizations of the famous Rogers-Ramanujan identities).

 

Many situations, such as disordered systems, require a logarithmic extension of the formalism. This is so for critical percolation whose proper conformal-field-theoretical setting  is now being developed. This is the initial work on a long-term project. This formalism should, in particular, explain naturally the physical observation of non-unitary representations (outside of the Kac table), in relation with non-local observables.



 A complementary aspect of the research proposal is a continuation of a long-term research program on supersymmetric integrable systems. The integrable systems under current study are the supersymmetric  many-body problems that generalize the Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models.   We have developed  powerful methods for obtaining their exact eigenfunctions. As an offshoot, our work has opened the entire new field of symmetric  orthogonal polynomials in superspace. A part of the research proposal is related to the completion of this mathematical formalism. But the main aim of the second wave of research on these supersymmetric  models is concerned with the exploration of its  physical applications, mainly in  conformal field theory and string theory.

"Lakeland is rural college located on the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The College curricula and research reflect strengths in agriculture and energy, the two major industries in the region. In response to regional demand, Lakeland has established expertise in renewable energy (RE) including the recent construction of an off-grid applied research and technology demonstration laboratory. 



Both AB and SK are predicting large increases in energy demands over the next 10 years. Centralized energy generation plants are the norm in both provinces, but transmission losses can be as high as 63%. A simple solution to this problem is distributed generation. RE technologies, such as solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, geothermal and wind, are readily applicable to distributed uses, particularly in residential, remote, rural and small commercial applications that are highly relevant to our region. Most RE installations incorporate a single component technology, such as solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, geothermal or wind. Hybrid installations have the potential to achieve increased efficiency if the components are working in synergy. Lakeland plans to develop multi-component monitoring, diagnostic, control and visualization systems for RE technologies. In addition, the College plans to incorporate heat storage concepts into hybrid systems to solve daily, seasonal and low temperature space heating challenges for the region.



NSERC funding will enhance and expand Lakeland's ability to deliver applied research solutions to advance the adoption of RE technologies in our region. This will be achieved through the development of relationships and linkages with stakeholder partners, increased regional industry awareness of Lakeland's renewable energy applied research capacity, and the generation of highly qualified trainees. This initiative will also support the development of the planned Renewable Energy Applied Research Centre at the College.

"The human p53 gene is among the most intensely studied because it is the prototype tumor suppressor gene. p53 is considered the prototype tumor suppressor because genetically engineered p53 null knockout mice acquire multiple tumors very early in life but are otherwise normal, human families with germline mutations in the p53 gene are highly cancer prone, and p53 is the most common mutated gene in human cancers. Interestingly, most tumors express mutant forms of p53 as opposed to loss of p53 expression and the reason for this remains poorly understood. The p53 protein is a DNA binding transcriptional transactivator that mediates the expression of cellular genes whose products impair the cell cycle and induce apoptosis. Loss of normal cellular p53 function favors tumorigenesis and also renders tumor cells resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy. With the support of NSERC during our last funding period, we discovered that alternative splicing of the human p53 gene results in the expression of a N-terminal truncated form of p53 termed deltaNp53(p47) which is capable of interacting with and inhibiting the full length p53.  A major question to be addressed in this proposal is whether deltaNp53(p47) behaves similar to tumor derived mutant p53 and more generally what is the function of  deltaNp53(p47). This research could provide a better understanding of why many tumors express a mutant p53.

"Improving Internet Security through Traffic Analysis and Examination of the Internet's Basic Properties



The Internet is arguably the biggest man-made entity. It is a very complex network that is not centrally controlled and that is continuously growing. This fashion of growth complicates network operation and management. However, if the end-goal is to have a network that facilitates communication the way the Internet does, it is inevitable that it will be that complex. This complexity led to questions on how the Internet actually works in terms of traffic patterns, logical and physical topologies, and geographical location of nodes. 



The objective of this research program is to improve Internet security through exploiting knowledge of Internet traffic and of its basic properties. The basic properties of the Internet refer to its topology and to the relation of  geographic location to the way Internet addresses are distributed and managed.  This is a twofold objective: the first is to better understand and gain knowledge of Internet traffic and basic properties. The second is to apply this knowledge in building new network security architectures, applications, and protocols, as well as in securing existing protocols and applications. The proposed research program will focus on the following lines of research: 

1- Traffic analysis of the patterns and structures that exist in Internet traffic.

2- Characterization of malicious activities. (e.g. SPAM, Denial-of-Service)

3- Relating network elements (hosts and routers) to geographical location.

"Space plays a fundamental role in human cognition. People often communicate about space through natural language, drawings and gestures. Interfaces based on the first modality are expected to expand the community of users and suit the demand for a wide-ranging access to computer systems (e.g., geographic information systems, content-based image retrieval systems, intelligent wheelchairs). Machines that could comprehend the organization of objects in space and communicate linguistically about space, like humans do, would be immeasurably helpful. They would facilitate the routine work of the experienced user; be accessible to the visually impaired; benefit the everyday, non-expert user, who is not inclined to spend much time on training and does not want to struggle with state of the art WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers) interfaces. The proposed work will constitute another step towards this ambitious goal. In everyday situations, space is often viewed as a construct induced by spatial relationships---which act as a connecting link between visually perceived data and natural language. There have been significant advancements in the development of computational models of these relationships. The link with natural language, however, has been overlooked. Simplifying assumptions lead to, e.g., computationally efficient algorithms, but not to cognitively plausible models. If a word as simple as ""north"" has significantly different meanings for the human and the machine, communication between the two is hindered. Since the formative years of spatial analysis, computational power has dramatically improved. Spatial relationships have been thoroughly investigated not only from a computational perspective, but from other perspectives also, including cognitive and linguistic. Our goal is to investigate the development of computational models of spatial relationships while shifting the focus to cognitive plausibility. It is to take another, significant step towards the development of systems able to understand and generate intuitive, human-like linguistic descriptions of spatial relationships.

"Summary



Membrane Distillation (MD) is a thermally driven process in which a microporous membrane acts as a physical barrier separating a warm solution from a cooler chamber, which contains either a liquid or a gas. The surface of the membrane should be sufficiently hydrophobic so that water is not allowed to enter the pores in its liquid form. Only vapour molecules will migrate through the membrane pores from the high to the low temperature side. MD has a great potential for applications for seawater desalination, food processing, VOCs removal etc.

Novel membranes for MD are developed in this project by the following two approaches.

1)    )	Preparation of composite porous hydrophobic/hydrophilic membranes, having a very thin hydrophobic layer and a thick hydrophilic layer. The resistance of vapour transport through the hydrophobic layer is low due to the thinness of the layer, while the heat loss through the membrane is small due to the thick hydrophilic layer, which minimizes the temperature polarization.

2)    )	Preparation of electro-spun nanofiber membranes of high permeability, having high porosity, interconnected open pore structure and talorable membrane thickness.

It is expected that the MD membranes of high permeability and high durability are achievable by these methods even from polymeric materials of relatively high hydrophilicity.

"A theory of chemistry called the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) has become increasingly popular among theoretical chemists in recent years. The theory interprets and predicts chemistry on the basis of a topological analysis of the electron density of molecules. The electron density can be calculated from theory and can also be observed experimentally in high-resolution X-ray crystallographic experiments (followed by a special treatment of data). In QTAIM the molecular space is partitioned into separate atomic regions allowing one to focus on *local* properties of regions in a molecule just like the mental focus of an experimental chemist on a specific functional group in a molecule. So far QTAIM has been applied mainly to molecules in their ground state equilibrium geometries. While this is an important domain of application it is insufficient for a complete understanding of molecular change, change which is what a large part of (bio)chemistry is all about. This research aims at focusing on the evolution of the electron density and its topology during molecular change: Change due to the breaking and making of chemical bonds, or due to complexation with metals, or due to external electromagnetic fields, or due to interaction with solvent. We will use QTAIM to analyze the electron density of reacting systems far from their equilibrium or transition state geometries. This exploration of full reaction paths with the means of QTAIM will yield dynamical and mechanistic information necessary to complement the static picture if one wishes to discuss reactivity. A small number of very recent isolated papers advanced similar propositions, but these lack the coherence of a dedicated research program. This proposal aims at contributing in filling this gap in knowledge by applying these ideas to a selection of important problems, examples of which include: I. The effect of metal ions and solvation on the energetics of hydrolysis of ATP (the universal cellular fuel par excellence), II. The effects of external EM fields on models of the lipid peroxidation of biomembranes, and III. The effects of external fields on the proton hopping in DNA, an accepted mechanism of spontaneous mutation.","Physical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Chemistry and Physics","Matta, CherifFarid","RGPIN ","Quantum and/or computational chemistry","Theoretical physics and chemistry","Physique et chimie th�oriques",1-1
"Our research program involves the study of the formation mechanisms, structure-bonding relationships, properties and chemical reactivity of selected paramagnetic reaction intermediates. They are sulfur-nitrogen heterocycles and organometallic transition metal half-sandwich complexes. These intermediates are fundamental building blocks that react to form important new magnetic, conducting and spin-electronic materials. We would like to understand how their structure and bonding influences their magnetic, electronic, chemical and physical properties.  This will be done by generating the intermediates and determining their experimental parameters, such as hyperfine (A) and g tensors by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), vibrational frequencies by Raman and infrared (IR) spectroscopy and their electronic excitation energies by ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy. These parameters will also be calculated by hybrid density functional, CAS-SCF or configuration interaction (CI) methods. The agreement between the computed and experimental parameters results in a comprehensive clear bonding picture from which concrete conclusions are made about the role of the intermediate in the mechanism of the overall formation reaction. We have successfully used this technique in the past. Organic semiquinone free radical intermediates that are involved in single electron transfer reactions of biological importance will also be studied by the same methods. When the reactive intermediates are short-lived, they will be trapped in rare-gas matrices at low temperatures (8-12 K). By matrix-isolating them, their experimental parameters are determined, via EPR, IR and UV-VIS spectroscopy, without the necessity of expensive ultra-fast techniques. EPR spectroscopy is our most important tool and we will continue to develop new methods of improving our home-built pulsed and conventional multi-frequency (4.5 - 35.0 GHz) EPR spectrometers. These include new pulsed electron-spin-echo techniques, phase-modulation detection and dielectric resonator probes that increase the spectrometers' sensitivities by a factor of 30. This will enhance their spectral resolution and the detection of smaller amounts of intermediates.","Advancement of knowledge","Advancement of knowledge",Chemistry,"Mattar, Saba","RGPIN ",Spectroscopy,"Physical chemistry","Chimie physique",3-5

"    )	Predicting future climate change is subject to layers of uncertainty in our understanding of how the climate system will respond to continued human emissions of greenhouse gases.  An important component of the puzzle is how natural cycles in the earth system regulate levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases.  In particular, the global carbon cycle currently absorbs about half of human carbon dioxide emissions in natural carbon sinks, but there is substantial uncertainty in estimates of how these carbon sinks will persist over the next century. This uncertainty is particularly large with respect to land carbon sinks, and propagates directly to uncertainty in projected future climate changes and climate impacts.

    )	In order to predict how much climate warming will occur over the next century, it is essential that we understand how carbon that is currently absorbed and stored in vegetation and soils will respond to future changes in temperature and precipitation.  Will land carbon sinks persist in the face of continued climate warming?  How well do global models simulate current land carbon uptake?  How might the availability of growth-limiting nutrients (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorus) change in the future and affect carbon uptake?  How will continued changes in human land-use affect the flows of carbon between the atmosphere and the biosphere?  Can we understand how structural differences between models affect future projections, and which model processes are critical to include in simulations of future climate change?  Can we use available data-sets to constrain probabilistically the range of future predictions that are consistent with current observations?  

    )	In this research, I plan to address each of these questions using an approach which combines global earth system modelling with recent observational and experimental information about global climate and ecosystem processes.  Through analysis and quantification of carbon cycle uncertainties, I hope to both improve our understanding of how carbon flows through the natural climate system, and sharpen predictions of how the climate system will respond to continued human greenhouse gas emissions.

"One of the goals of all statistical work is the estimation of key features of the measurement of interest in the target population.  An example of such a feature might be median household income, or perhaps the proportion of the adult population that suffers from diabetes.  These estimates can be expressed either as a specific value (a point estimate) or a range of plausible values (an interval estimate).  The spread of an interval estimate reflects the uncertainty with which the feature can be estimated using information obtained by sampling units from the target population, and measuring the feature on the units in the sample.



The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods of deriving both point and interval estimates in various types of scientific studies, especially those carried out by researchers in medicine and public health.  Better methods of estimation should lead to more precise knowledge in all areas of research that depend on sampling and statistical analysis.

"Imagine writing a detailed biography of our Sun by studying other stars like the Sun at different stages in their lives.  Imagine forecasting the weather on a planet outside our Solar System and providing information on an alien world to test global models of climate change on Earth.  Imagine finding another Earth around another Sun.  



These ideas sound like science fiction but they've entered the realm of science fact thanks to research with Canada's MOST space telescope, in collaboration with the French CoRoT space mission and the American Kepler mission (which is on the horizon  to go above the horizon).  Canadian astronomers and their students, with colleagues from around the world, are putting stars under an astronomical ""stakeout"", monitoring their brightness variations with unprecedented precision from space.  



These data can reveal the hidden interiors of stars and chart their life histories, by translating stellar pulsations into structural information through the techniques of asteroseismology.  The acoustic vibrations of stars being born allow us to perform the equivalent of ultrasound on stellar embryos.  Those vibrations, observed in a red giant star, are like the pulse of a dying Sun.  These represent the prologue and epilogue of a life story that can last over ten billion years.  Sensitive spacebased photometry of stars with exoplanets can measure the eclipse of the planet and determine its atmospheric properties, cloudiness and thermal circulation (weather).  These data can be searched for transits that betray the passages of planets as small as the Earth orbiting another star, and they can reveal the effects of the interactions between the magnetic fields of a star and a ""hot Jupiters"" hugging close to it in a tight orbit.

"One ever-fascinating story is how fertilization activates the emergence of a new generation and how cellular signaling pervades every single aspect of plant development.

Working with a solanaceous species as well as with the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, we are studying the involvement of a phylogenetically related small three members MAPKKK family. These MAPKKK are involved in various aspects of both male and female reproductive development, including ovule integument and embryo sac development. One side effect of mutations in these genes is the reduction or absence of pollen tube guidance towards the ovules, which is also the subject of intense studies. Besides from the fundamental knowledge to be gained on how these subtle and interconnected signaling networks act on organ development and sexual reproduction, the proposed work also have direct relevance towards agronomical goals, including parthenocarpy as well as widening gene pools through more efficient hybridization of phylogenetically close species.","Agriculture and primary food production","Agriculture and primary food production","Sciences biologiques","Matton, Daniel","RGPIN ","Plant reproduction","Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",1-5

"Host selection by Lepidoptera larvae has been extensively studied. Much of the research has inferred the chemoreception process (taste, olfaction) involved in insects detecting and recognizing their food source. Such studies on host selection, however, have mainly consisted of presenting insects with an assortment of discs made from different plant host material for a given time period and measuring the quantity of the disk consumed. These studies can provide information on taste preferences but capture only a fraction of the behavioral complexity of the feeding process. For instance, the procedure overlooks the behavior of the insect on a given leaf such that the insect may demonstrate constant consumption or exhibit sporadic feeding, or even eat the leaf in a determined pattern. Laboratory investigations of how insects behave on their host leaf could provide insights on the different behavioral strategies used by insects to complete their feeding stages. I propose to address specific questions on the feeding behavior of a forest Lepidoptera (Malacosoma disstria). The objectives are to test experimentally the feeding behavior of this forest insect on a diversity of its host plants at different phenological stages.  In offering different phenogical stages of the leaves it will provide insight on how the chemistry of the leaves may interfere with the feeding pattern of this Lepidoptera. I propose to do this by filming the insects feeding on leaves of a number of selected host plants at different phenological stages.  In video taping these insects it will permit to discriminate the feeding behavior of the insect that could demonstrate active feeding or resting during their meal, or even record the pattern of consumption on the leaf. This research will provide a basic understanding of how phonological changes in the host plant can lead to alterations of herbivore feeding behavior. This information will enhance our understanding of forest defoliators and could provide guidance to more environmentally sound management practices.","Forestry (silviculture, forest management)","Natural resources (economic aspects)","Sciences biologiques","Mauffette, Yves","RGPIN ","Plant-animal interaction","Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie",2-2

"Every year, billions of dollars are lost worldwide in failing software projects due to incorrect requirements. This project will investigate processes, techniques and tools to help resolve this problem the context of distributed agile teams. 

Agile methods and outsourcing or off-shoring are two major trends in the software industry. Both approaches help Canadian software teams to stay competitive in the global maket.

Agile methods and distributed teams are not immediately compatible: agile methods suggest putting all team members into the same workspace to improve communication and collaboration while outsourcing and off-shoring development results in distributed teams that take advantage of off-site expertise and, in the case of off-shoring, of lower costs per developer hour. The proposed research will address this apparent incompatibility by addressing the following key problems:

1.    )	Our research will provide an agile planning and project management tool for distributed teams. The tool will support synchronous distributed planning and improve current ad-hoc techniques used by distributed agile teams.

2.    )	We will investigate if and how executable acceptance tests can be used to improve communication of software requirements between all stakeholders in the software development effort. Our research will look at the impact of using executable acceptance tests in collocated as well as distributed settings.

3.    )	We will develop social-networking technology to help find domain experts or technical experts among the team members for upcoming development tasks. The same technology will also be used to improve knowledge sharing between dispersed team members.

"The overall goal of the proposed project is to combine agile methods with approaches from interaction design to help agile teams to cost-effectively create usable and maintainable software systems.

Agile software development methods (like Extreme Programming, Scrum and Lean Software Development) are quickly moving into the mainstream of software development organizations. Agile methods are human-centered approaches that encourage continual realignment of development goals with the needs and expectations of all the stakeholders. They concentrate on significantly improving communications and interactions (among team members and with the stakeholder representatives), promote continuous feedback, focus on transparency & ""clean code that works"", and merciless testing to achieve high software quality.

Interaction design and usability engineering  approaches promote focusing on users, their goals and needs in software development. They highlight that usability is key to success in software development projects.

In the proposed research program, we will investigate processes, methods and tools to help agile teams to increase the usability of their software products. We will empirically investigate how interaction design approaches can be integrated with agile methods. Based on the results of these studies, we will identify integrated techniques as well as opportunities for tools to support the integrated process. We will then conduct experiments with student subjects to fine-tune the techniques and tools. Case studies in industry will be conducted to evaluate benefits and limitations of the proposed approaches. Initially, we will focus on agile project planning and executable acceptance testing. We will extend our current approaches by the ability to do user interface level acceptance testing. In addition, we will use low fidelity prototyping to support agile release planning and project charting.

"Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM) is useful because it probes the chemical or biochemical activity of a surface. It does so by measuring a current at a sensor that is moved towards or over a sample using precise positioners. This specific detection method can detect small concentrations of compounds being absorbed or released from cancer cells. To apply SECM to live cell studies, cells have to be immobilized on a solid support. The sensor is positioned non-invasively a few microns above it.  The cells are then stimulated by a chemical to release compounds that can directly be detected by SECM. From such measurements and using numerical simulations, the rates of transport and kinetic parameters related to these events can be extracted

 

Our research program is divided in three research areas that apply electrochemistry to three different biological problems. 



1. The relation between oxidative stress and the development of Multidrug Resistance in cancer cells.  

2. The transport of compounds through specially activated proteins found in human cancer cells.

3. The development of cell wires used to electrochemically study cell communication.



The outcome of this work is important because it will increase our understanding of multidrug resistance, this phenomena is responsible for serious secondary effects of chemotherapy. It will also increase our understanding of non-selective pumps and ion channels that are desirable pharmaceutical targets since they mediate transport to and from the cell and its environment. The development of new drug targets and diagnostic tests involving ion channels are expected to be fast growing markets in the years to come.

"Aside from maybe the periodic table, there is nothing more fundamental to chemistry than the concept of the chemical bond.  Models of the chemical bond, originally suggested to explain experimental observations and to guide new experiments, have become more and more elaborate as the synthesis of exotic and esoteric chemical compounds has increased.  Central to all models is the original electron pair concept of Lewis. The advent of quantum chemistry helped solidify this concept and advances in computational quantum chemistry have since refined and broadened the definition of the chemical bond. It has also provided a means of examining the concept in molecules that are currently unavailable due to certain synthetic limitations.

  Current models provide a viable description of multiple bonding in compounds composed of first row, or light, atoms like C,N and O.  However, they are poorly suited for describing the bonding in the analogous heavy atom compounds.  A recent new comer to the chemical scene are the heavier analogs of acetylene, first synthesized in 2000.  These compounds have structures and reactivities that deviate considerably from the carbon analogs and there is considerable debate over how to characterize the bonding.

   We propose to study various group 14 and group 13/15 alkyne analogs (XEE'Y), varying the substituents X and Y to assess the effect on the structure and reactivity and hence the electronic structure and bonding.  Since the majority of these compounds are basically hypothetical, computational quantum chemistry will be used to assess the structural features, reactivity with various reagents and properties related to the chemical bond.  A detailed analysis of the bonding in these compounds will provide a more complete description of the multiple bond concept, which is invaluable to many aspects of chemistry.

"Besides being the 'energy factories' of the cell, recent research has uncovered that mitochondria may be used by the cell as a way of sensing environmental stress.  These stresses may include, for example, changes in temperature, nutrient availability, hormones, as well as signals associated with pathogens.  It is thought that stresses alter specific aspects of mitochondrial function and that, in turn, these alterations activate signals which are sent throughout the cell changing physiological and biochemical properties which enable the cell to better deal with the stress - a process called acclimation.  Interestingly, disruptions in the ability of the mitochondrion to act as a sensor and trigger acclimation responses are linked to a number of human diseases, as well as aging.  Stress-induced signals from the mitochondrion are known to travel to the nucleus where they trigger alterations in gene expression which are critical to the acclimation response. 

What within the mitochondrion is altered by stress factors?  How are changes to the mitochondrion communicated to the nucleus to bring about changes in gene expression?  These are two major questions that are addressed by my research program. To tackle these my laboratory is taking a molecular/genetic approach using the single-celled green alga, Chlamydomonas. We have isolated mutants of Chlamydomonas which are different than normal cells in regards to their response to stresses which alter mitochondrial function.  Over the next few years a major focus of my research program is to characterize these mutants and determine what genes have been disrupted in these cells and what role these genes may serve in the interplay between mitochondrial function and nuclear gene expression. 

Because maintaining normal mitochondrial function and signalling is fundamental to the cell, the findings of my NSERC-funded research program may have profound implications for our understanding of how organisms as diverse as plants and humans sense and respond to a range of factors in their growth environment.

"There are increasing concerns regarding the environmental impact of Alberta's oilsands industry, including the cumulative impact of the N and S emissions from all currently operational oilsand projects on the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic environment. A quantifiable assessment of this impact would benefit from the ability to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic N and S contributions to the environment. This project will determine the stable isotope compositions of N and S compounds in (a) industrial emissions, (b) atmospheric deposition, and (c) various environmental receptors including lichens, plant foliage, soils and surface water obtained from numerous sites located at various distances from the major emission sources in the Athabasca oilsands region around Fort McMurray. The obtained results will reveal to which extent stable isotope ratios of N and S compounds emitted from the oilsands operations can be used, in concert with chemical analyses, to trace the fate of industrial emissions in the surrounding terrestrial and aquatic environment. The project will make a major innovative contribution to assessing the environmental footprint of industrial N and S emission from the Athabasca oilsands region and devise strategies for long-term monitoring of N and S emissions. This will help to demonstrate to Canadians and consumers world-wide that industrial operators in the Athabasca oilsands region of northeastern Alberta are serious about assessing the environmental impact of their N and S emissions in a scientifically testable manner thereby demonstrating their commitment to environmental stewardship.

"The vadose zone, i.e. partially water saturated soils and sediments that extend from ground surface to the water table, constitutes a dynamic environment which receives water through infiltration of precipitation, exchanges gases with the atmosphere, and is affected by a range of geochemical and microbially mediated processes and plant-soil interactions. For example, organic contaminants, which have contacted soils through accidental spills, leaky underground storage tanks, or pipelines breaks, may be attenuated by enhanced biodegradation activity prior to contaminating the fully saturated groundwater zone. Similarly, the vadose zone can play an important role in the uptake and destruction of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere or from underlying anaerobic aquifers. On the other hand, soils and wetlands can significantly contribute to the production and emission of greenhouse gases. To understand these complex interactions and to predict contaminant attenuation and gas exchange with the atmosphere, it is necessary to consider the rhizosphere (i.e. the soil zone affected by plant roots), the vadose zone, and the saturated groundwater zone as an integrated system. Such an approach allows an evaluation of how vadose zone processes affect groundwater quality, and how transport and reaction processes in soils and wetlands affect the exchange of greenhouse gases with the atmosphere. 

Numerical reactive transport models are powerful tools for investigating these complex systems. However, models currently available are often limited to specific applications and are still incomplete in that they neglect important processes. This research program focuses on the development of flexible and mechanistic reactive transport modeling tools, which can be used to more rigorously study the mobilization and attenuation of contaminants, and to evaluate the role of soils and wetlands in contributing to the emission or consumption of greenhouse gases. Modeling studies will be complemented by focused laboratory and field studies designed to evaluate how biogenic gas production in aquifers polluted with organic contaminants affect contaminant release and attenuation.

"Over the years research in robot manipulators has been increasing rapidly. This has led to the development of efficient conventional methodologies for simple industrial robot manipulators capable of performing simple tasks. However, there is already a great need in the Service, Industry, and Space, sectors for complex robotic systems (such as manipulators with many degrees of freedom, multi-manipulator systems, and/or robotic systems being re-configurable) that can perform complicated tasks. Furthermore, many of the developed conventional approaches turn out not to be entirely generic and their efficiency for complex robotic systems is not considered conclusive for on-line and truly real-time operations. Consequently, it is necessary to devote research efforts to the development of novel methodologies for complex robotic systems.



In order to ensure effective real-time implementations and successful results for complex robotic systems it is necessary to develop and implement under a common Framework some Artificial & Computational Intelligence, and/or Soft Computing, (Artificial Neural Networks, Fuzzy Inference Systems) techniques.



The proposed research program is focused on developing, under a common Framework, Artificial Neural Networks and Adaptive Fuzzy Inference Systems methodologies for their implementation on a key robotics and industrial technology area: The Intelligent Motion Planning of Robot Manipulator Systems. 



The proposed research will successfully accomplish: the realization of computationally fast algorithms for the truly real-time operation and motion planning of complex Robot Manipulator Systems. Furthermore, it will also provide new insights for the development and implementation of advanced robotics systems to be used in the near future in the Service, Industry, and Space sectors.

"Pacific salmon are an important fisheries resource for Canada, with significant links to both regional and national economies, and social and cultural heritage of BC's coastal communities and First Nations. In recent decades the productivity of Pacific salmon has been declining, with several stocks all but disappearing.  Although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, there is a growing sense that such declines may be linked to large-scale changes in ocean conditions and the resultant variability in temperature, nutrients, the quantity and quality of zooplankton, forage fish and predator assemblages. Currently there are significant uncertainties in the prediction and forecast of annual adult salmon returns, which can lead to significant loss of business and negative socio-economic consequences for coastal communities. Our proposal to understand and

model the large-scale variability in feeding, foodweb and resource ecology of juvenile salmon at the scale of coastal Pacific ecosystems of BC is critical to improving Canada's ability to forecast and predict the growth, survival and associated adult returns of Pacific salmon with greater confidence. Our three-year project will quantify and model coastal-scale variability in: 1) nitrogen and carbon dynamics, using zooplankton isotopic signatures; 2) foodweb dynamics and trophic interactions within and among juvenile salmon species; and 3) the links between patterns of juvenile salmon growth and food quality, feeding ecology, and foodweb structure. To achieve our research objectives, we have established a strong partnership with the Pacific Biological Station (DFO) and have assembled a strong interdisciplinary research team. This project will produce fundamentally important information on large-scale spatial variability in nutrient and energy sources, foodweb dynamics,

trophic interactions and the growth of juvenile salmon, which will lead to better understanding and management of one of Canada's precious natural resources.",Environment,Environment,Biology,"Mazumder, Asit","STPGP ","Aquatic ecology and limnology","Evolution and ecology","�volution et �cologie","2 & 3-3"

"The proposed work consists of a number of studies that investigate erosion in cohesive soils.  Cohesive soils are those that contain clay and are prevalent in nature.  Study of erosion is important because it can affect people in many ways.  Bridges can fail if water flows around bridge piers erode away the soil on which they are founded.  Dams, culverts, and weirs can be destabilized by erosion of riverbeds downstream of the structures.  Erosion of riverbanks can result in loss of property.  To predict erosion and attempt to mitigate its negative impacts, engineers must be able to assess under what conditions a particular soil will erode and by how much.  For cohesive soils, there are currently no reliable methods to make these assessments.



The proposed work will focus on improving field methods of measuring erosion resistance of cohesive soils.  It will also be used to develop a better understanding of the forms of erosion in these soils.  A first study will be used to quantify the variability in erosion that might be expected if flow and soil conditions are constant between erosion tests.  A second study will look at improving models for predicting how quickly the soil will erode by including the effects of pressure fluctuations on the soil surface.  A third study will investigate how the form of erosion changes with varied clay content in the soil.  Finally, experiments will be undertaken to evaluate how groundwater seeping through a soil effects the form of erosion and how quickly it erodes.



The results of these studies should allow engineers to better design and maintain critical infrastructure such as bridges and dams.  This will ultimately improve the protection of the public from failure of these structures, which has both social and economic benefits.

"I aim at developing conceptual and mathematical models for the thermodynamic and momentum, heat and mass transfer mechanisms that determine the self-assembly of edible multicomponent systems subject to different external fields (temperature profiles, shear and extensional flow, etc.). Shear flow is used very empirically in industry to obtain desired structural properties, but little fundamental knowledge exists. This application focuses on crystallization of multicomponent lipid systems prepared with pure components. This will somewhat simplify the complexity from the multicomponent nature and the polymorphism of these materials: even a pure component can form different solid phases. Studies at high temperature will look at the initial steps when the particles are nanometres in size, because they are crucial to the spatial distribution of particles, that will impact all the crystallization mechanisms occurring at later stages. Studies at lower temperatures will include polymorphic transformations. Models based on fundamental mechanisms and amenable to work under flow and variable temperature are required. Yet, the few models used in the literature do not have that flexibility. I recently developed a successful model for the crystallization of palm oil and milk fat under shear (e.g. Phys. Rev. E. 71, 041607, 2005), and propose to examine the hypotheses proposed with that model: impact of particle segregation on growth/nucleation ratios, acceleration of polymorphic transformations by secondary nucleation of undercooled liquid, and layered crystallization. To examine these hypotheses we require measurements that integrate several methods to provide quantitative phase distribution, particle characteristics and mechanical properties in-situ and in real time. We will combine NMR, rheology and synchrotron XRD. Done simultaneously these measurements will mean a breakthrough in the study crystallization kinetics of multi-phase systems. The findings will be very useful for aggregation processes in other materials as well since the lipid molecules have sizes between large polymers and small compounds.","Processed food products and beverages","Manufacturing processes and products","Process Engineering and Applied Science","Mazzanti, Gianfranco","RGPIN ","Food processing, packaging, preservation and storage","Food science and technology","Science et technologie de l'alimentation",3-5

"In the last decade, high-precision geodetic measurements have provided crucial new results that have dramatically improved our understanding of active tectonics and natural hazards in Canada and worldwide. Building on our strong experience in these fields, the goal of this proposal is to integrate and combine geodetic and remote sensing data to better understand and model crustal deformation and geodynamics of western Canada. We will carry out and combine geodetic measurements such as absolute gravity, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Radar interferometry (InSAR), to produce high-precision and high-accuracy estimates of present-day crustal deformation in western Canada. These data are essential to understand the geodynamics of the Canadian Cordillera and western Canada plate boundaries. These results will be used to constrain hazard assessment from earthquakes and relative sea-level rise. In particular, vertical land motion is a crucial factor in estimates of future relative sea level. The budget for this proposal will be used in majority to support graduate students and under-graduate coop students, and to a small extent to support field measurements at selected GPS and absolute gravity sites.

"Evolution is the fundamental process responsible for biological diversity. Differences between species have arisen over millions of years, but represent the accumulation of many small evolutionary changes, which occur over single generations.  Understanding the ecological causes of short-term evolutionary changes requires that key ecological factors are identifiable, measurable, and amenable to experimental manipulations.  Uncovering these relationships between ecology and evolution is extremely valuable because they not only help us to understand how evolution happens in nature, but also provide the opportunity to predict how organisms will respond to future environmental changes.



One component of my research program investigates the importance of food abundance to the contemporary adaptation of red squirrels in the Yukon.  I have been studying these red squirrels since 1998 and over that time have compiled an unprecedented understanding of the evolutionary changes that have occurred in this wild mammal.  For example, we found that red squirrels have evolved to breed earlier in the spring in association with warmer spring temperatures.  In this proposal we will test the importance of food abundance to the evolution of red squirrel reproduction. This research will provide novel insights into evolutionary responses to environmental changes in a northern mammal and will provide training to many graduate and undergraduate students and technicians in field research in Canada's North.

My students and I use observations and field experiments with a variety of wild animals to test the importance of ecology to contemporary evolution.  In this proposal, I outline a series of experiments with red squirrels, deer mice and an invasive zooplankton that will identify the importance of food abundance, competition and predation to contemporary adaptation in these species. This research will provide insights into the impacts that human activities have on evolution as a result of climate change and the movement of invasive species, but more generally will give us a better understanding of how evolution happens in nature.

"This study aims to enhance the accuracy and predictive power of population dynamics models for highly migratory fishes with the use of advanced survey technology data. The objectives include: (1) Formulate and fit area-, and seasonally-structured population dynamics models to data obtained from electronic data storage, radio-telemetry and conventional tags, and stock identification (ID) studies, i.e., genetic and micro-constituent (MC) analyses of fish body parts. (2) Evaluate the potential reductions in bias in abundance estimates obtained from models fitted to these data compared to models fitted to more commonly used data such as fisheries dependent data and conventional tagging data only. (3) Project the models to evaluate the potential biological consequences of alternative management actions for the fish populations studied. (4) Evaluate the hypothesis that multi-century episodes of exploitation in the Pacific and Mediterranean populations of bluefin tuna have caused genetic adaptations for lower, i.e., 4 yr age at maturity in these populations compared to that of 12 yrs in the Southern Ocean and Gulf of Mexico populations. New stock assessment models are to be developed for Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tuna that are fitted to records from conventional, pop-up and archival tagging studies and genetic stock IDs from some of these fish. Statistical methods to reconstruct seasonal and ontogenetic migrations of individual white sturgeon are to be developed. Migration pathway models will be fitted to mark-recapture, radio-telemetry, fin ray MC data for 100 Nechako River sturgeon. Multivariate statistical methods will be applied to the reconstructed migration histories to identify different spawning populations. These results will be utilized as inputs to spatially and stock structured population dynamics models that are to be fitted to available mark-recapture data to estimate total annual survival rates and abundance of the one or more spawning stocks. The research offers to improve understanding of fish migratory behaviours, population structure and dynamics, the reliability of predictions from population dynamics models, and the design of recovery activities, and offers methodologies for application to other populations.

"Everyday we are faced with the challenge of interacting with different objects in our environment.  The focus of this research proposal stems from the basic idea that we cannot process all the information that is presented to our sensory system at a given time.  As a result, we must select certain information for more detailed processing while ignoring other information.  The mechanism used to select information presented in the visual field is visual attention.  We typically examine visual attention in a controlled laboratory setting.  However, in everyday situations we are faced with the problem of paying attention to objects in our visual field while performing a number of different actions.  As we move about our environment our autonomic nervous system is activated.  For example, when we experience linear acceleration or when we move from a seated position to a standing position there is a resulting activation of the autonomic nervous system.  Recently, in our lab, we have found that autonomic nervous system activation resulted in the attenuation of reflexive orienting attention.  We propose that activation of the autonomic nervous system operates to focus or stabilize attention.  The focus of this research program is to further examine the relationship between the autonomic nervous system and the allocation of attention to object and locations in the visual field.  Activation of the autonomic nervous system provides a window to explore how our visual attention mechanisms might operate in everyday situations.  Determining the interaction between autonomic nervous system activation and attention will provide a more complete understanding of how the different mechanisms in the central nervous system relate to cognitive function.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge","Education, Faculty of","McAuliffe, James(Jim)","RGPIN ",Psychology,Psychology,Psychologie,3-5
"As water distribution systems are vulnerable to a variety of accidental or deliberate contaminant intrusion events, improved understanding of exposure risks is critical to provision of secure and safe water supply systems.  The proposed research involves development of improved understanding of attenuation/dieoff of chlorine residuals, strategies for incorporating quantitative microbial risk assessment and infrastructure reliability capabilities, and the development of optimal methodologies for placement of monitoring sensors within water distribution systems.



The research will produce innovation in detection methodologies incorporating fault tree methodologies as a bottom-up approach to provide a systematic description of the combination of potential occurrences in a system which may result in water quality failure within water distribution networks.  The probabilities of infrastructure failure (e.g. due to aging infrastructure components within systems) and/or bioterrorism events will be incorporated, via fault tree analyses, to provide methodologies for improved quantification of failure risk potential and the contributory effects of mechanical failure and detection methodologies.  



Compared with microbial detection methodologies, detection methodologies for chemical excursions (e.g. TOC, turbidity, chlorine residuals, etc.) are much easier and the latter procedures provide instantaneous results.  Based on the knowledge that microbial contamination may impact these parameters, combinations of these parameters can be used to make inferences whether a microbial contamination event has occurred.  Bayesian methodologies will be developed as classification procedures for contamination event identification, allowing for improved decision-making environments for planning and operations within water distribution systems.

"This research effort is based on the study of chemical reactions that take place on catalyst surfaces. These processes only take place rapidly when the reactant molecules encounter each other on custom-made catalyst surfaces. The Chinese characters for 'catalyst' can also be used for 'mariage broker'. Our research is aimed at understanding how the catalyst guides and activates the reactants-one couple at a time- towards a happy union. The guiding forces can range from the brutal to the most subtle; the catalyst may need to split the reactants into fragments before the reaction occurs, or it may simply need to induce reaction on one specific face of a molecule as in a chiral reaction. We use a combination of surface science research tools to interrogate the forces that govern the reactivity of  single molecular layers in contact with a catalyst surface. The projects are centered on two families of reactions, olefin and alkyne metathesis and chiral catalysis. The molecular details gleaned from these studies are of primary importance to progress in many areas other than catalysis. This is because solid surfaces are used as literally the foundation of many modern technologies such as sensing and nanodevices.

"Fragmentation increasingly characterizes computer systems that support human learning. Social fragmentation occurs when learners are divided into disparate virtual learning communities. Technological fragmentation occurs when the learning technology is no longer a monolithic single system but consists of a loose collection of learning objects (the ""content"") and processes (called agents) gathered ""just in time"" to help learner(s) achieve their learning goals. With my graduate students and colleagues, I have been investigating a number of issues that arise when building fragmented learning technologies. One issue is allowing fragmented systems to adapt to individual differences among learners. In a fragmented system adaptivity to learners must be highly reactive to context and purpose, thus necessitating a new active approach to learner modelling. A second issue is to discover how agents can model each other and negotiate with each other to achieve various goals. A third issue is the social and information environment that surrounds learners. My past research has investigated characteristics affecting effective social and group interaction. My proposed research investigates two approaches to supporting learners in this environment. In one, the ecological approach, learner models and learner interaction data are automatically associated with the learning objects in the environment and then ""data mined"" for patterns that can help achieve various pedagogical purposes (such as finding individualized content for learners). In the other, a social computing approach, tools are provided for learners to annotate the learning objects themselves, and to share these annotations to facilitate their learning. These issues are being explored by building working prototypes and trying them with real learners. Research into these issues draws from, and can contribute to, many disciplines: artificial intelligence in education, user modelling and adaptive systems, data mining, artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and areas of social science. The ultimate goal is learning technology that can knowledgeably and flexibly support learners, both individually and in groups.

"Observational studies are important tools for empirical research in medicine, the social sciences and economics.  But the chief difficulty is that study findings are often plagued with biases, such as confounding and measurement error.  This research program will investigate a burgeoning area of data analytic techniques called Bayesian bias modelling.   Bias modelling extends conventional parametric models to incorporate additional parameters which capture assumptions about bias.    Because the observational study contains no information about the magnitude of bias, it means that the resulting model is nonidentifiable. To analyze the data, the investigator supplies user inputs in the form of prior distributions for bias parameters. Bayes theorem then gives a principled synthesis of the data with prior beliefs about bias.  Thus Bayesian bias modelling techniques are better able to quantify total uncertainty in observational studies rather than the usual uncertainty due to random error.  



The objective of this research program is to develop novel Bayesian bias modelling techniques, with emphasis on confounding and measurement error.  Further, we will conduct detailed investigations of the performance and operating characteristics of the proposed methods, compared to data-analytic techniques that ignore bias.   Pressing research questions involve the development of off-the-shelf techniques for assigning default priors to high dimensional vectors of bias parameters. A further challenge is the trade off between parsimony and complexity in modelling complex bias structures.  This program will be collaborative in nature, drawing upon expertise from statisticians and epidemiologist within Canada and the United Kindom at Imperial College London.  It is anticipate that the research findings will well received by the applied statistical community, and provide analysts with the tools needed to draw improved inferences from observational data.

"Scientists are now realizing that we are losing species at unprecedented rates. As such, this biodiversity crisis has pressed scientists to rapidly document nature's bountiful diversity before it is lost. Nonetheless, the meaning and implications of this massive species loss for ecosystem stability and function remain a mystery.  



This research program is tackling this important issue by first empirically assessing just how diversity and its accompanying food web structure are being modified. Second, and importantly, this empirical biodiversity ""assessment"" is being used to test and develop theory that delineates what this changing biodiversity (i.e., both diversity and food web structure) actually means for society (i.e., how does biodiversity loss influence the stability and functioning of nature's ecosystems?). 



To accomplish these goals, one axis of this research program will empirically characterize the landscape scale food web structure of ecosystems over fundamental gradients in environmental variation (e.g., climate, human density) using stable isotope analysis. This gradient food web analysis will allow us one of the first glimpses at how food webs actually respond to human-induced variation.  The second axis of this research program will concurrently test and develop theory that addresses the functional implications of altered food web structure for the maintenance of diversity and the functioning of ecosystems. This broad research program thus promises to move us toward a theory for the management of ecosystems under the threat of decreased biodiversity. This highly collaborative and novel research program will provide an excellent training ground for both graduate students and post doctoral researchers in this critical area.

"This proposal focuses on the analysis of a family of optimization and evolution problems having applications in physics, geometry, medical imaging, partial differential equations, and economics.  Linking them together is a transportation problem --- which comes into play whenever the dynamics conserve a local quantity.  It can be caricatured as follows: Given a distribution of iron mines throughout the countryside,  and a distribution of factories which require iron ore,  decide which mines should supply ore to each factory in order to minimize the total transportation costs.  Here the cost per ton of ore transported from the mine at x to factory at y is specified by a function c(x,y).  However, when the mines and factories are distributed continuously over a curved landscape, then the problem has a rich structure and deep connections to geometry, nonlinear partial differential equations and the topology of the cost function, which have only begun to be explored.



Incarnations of this problem embed in current models of surprisingly diverse phenomena. Included among the subjects of proposed research are questions related to atmospheric weather patterns, groundwater drainage,  pollutant diffusion, population spreading, and economic decision problems facing informational asymmetry.



In addition to these applications (and motivated by them),  this proposal includes a continuing investigation of the structure of solutions --- maps or otherwise --- to the transportation problem in a variety of geometric settings.  Despite much recent progress,  basic questions still remains:  classify all costs for which solutions are unique;  understand when production location will vary smoothly with consumption,  and,  if this is not the case, identify the nature and location of discontinuities.  Although the research is directed primarily at gaining scientific understanding, it has potential applications for resource management, engineering design, weather prediction, improved microeconomic and policy decisions, and logistics.

"The overarching theme of the program of research outlined in this proposal is the development and application of methodologies to determine changes to the metabolome of organisms exposed to chemical pollutants.  The long-term goal of this work is to understand not only which biochemical pathways are most impacted by contaminant exposures but also which contaminants in complex environmental mixtures are primarily responsible for the metabolic alterations in cells.  This goal will be attained through the development of a bioassay-directed protocol in which comprehensive metabolomics analyses will be performed on cells exposed to chromatographic fractions derived from complex environmental matrices such as urban air particulate, diesel exhaust and coal tar.

    )	The metabolome of an organism is its global metabolite profile under a given set of conditions while the study of the metabolome has been termed ""metabolomics.""  The metabolome is the manifestation of the phenotype of the organism and, as such, is a direct link to the complex web of metabolic functions and pathways within a cell.  The comprehensive metabolomic analyses will be performed on polar extracts (i.e., amino acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, etc. using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and on non-polar extracts (i.e., lipids using infusion electrospray mass spectrometry methods) from cells exposed to environmental contaminants.  These experiments will require the development of robust analytical protocols and data analysis using modern multi-variate analysis tools (e.g., OPLS-DA).

    )	Improvements in metabolomics methodologies will be applicable across all areas of metabolomics implementation - in studies of bacteria, small organisms, small animals and humans.  The creation of a bioassay-directed metabolomics methodology would have direct application in a number of areas, including pharmaceutical development and drug discovery, human diseases (e.g., cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc.) and in new areas for metabolomics (e.g., antimicrobial resistance, brain disorders, etc.).

"This proposal addresses the necessity of developing an early-warning strategy to detect potential threats to

drinking water sources. Natural bodies of water that ultimately constitute some of Canada's drinking water

supply can contain a variety of pollutants such as heavy metals, PAHS, halogenated organic molecules,

pharmaceuticals, pathogens, etc. While the associated health risks of some of these components are already

known, there remains an alarming lack of research in many other areas. Our proposal will develop an

innovative approach to assessing the potential toxicity of waterborne contaminants before these deleterious

constituents reach drinking-water facilities. We will use a holistic, multi organism-based system to measure

stress reactions in the aquatic community and will monitor these stress responses in real-time. We will also

develop ecotoxicity models based on dose-responses of individual organisms to specific classes of stressors

(chemical and biological). These models will aid in the interpretation of the data and will provide information

for water-utilities managers about the nature of the stressor. Also, this knowledge will be useful in strategies to

minimize risk to end-users. The ultimate goal of our proposal is the development and implementation of an

early-warning system in real-time for drinking-water facilities that would detect chemical contaminants and

pathogens using biomonitoring organisms. In order to achieve this, our project will: 1) measure responses in

aquatic plants and invertebrates to chemical stressors at environmentally-relevant concentrations and to

pathogens; 2) develop a microarray-based test that can be used to directly detect pathogenic organisms; 3) build

and test a flow-through system in a drinking-water facility for stress-response determinations in real-time; 4)

develop methods of stereotyped responses for the whole suite of biomonitoring organisms to chemical

contaminants and pathogens. These models will be used to predict the nature of contamination when responses

are observed among the organisms. These models will ultimately form the basis of the early-warning system to

monitor potential toxicity of chemical and biological agents in real-time at drinking-water facilities.",Water,"Transportation systems and services","Chemistry and Biology","McCarthy, Lynda","STPGP ","Water quality, pollution","Environmental engineering","G�nie de l'environnement",3-3

"Plant diseases cause significant economic losses to field and horticultural crops in Canada, affecting the entire Canadian economy from producers to consumers. Direct financial losses result from decreased quantity and quality of plant produce, but indirect costs can result from pathogen-produced toxins that affect human and animal health. Fungal pathogens cause the majority of plant diseases and have evolved different strategies for successfully infecting their plant hosts. One strategy is necrotrophy, where the fungus kills host tissue before or during fungal invasion. Nutrients are extracted from the dead host tissue for fungal growth and reproduction. The production of toxins is a key determinant of pathogenesis for necrotrophic fungi. The long-term goal of this research program is to uncover the molecular basis of interactions between necrotrophic fungal pathogens and their plant hosts. The Triticum-Stagonospora nodorum pathosystem will be used in this research as a model pathosystem. S. nodorum (synonym Septoria nodorum, teleomorph Phaeosphaeria nodorum) is a common necrotrophic pathogen of Triticum aestivum (common wheat) and Triticum turgidum subspecies durum (durum wheat) in Canada, and causes the leaf spotting disease stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB). The main objectives of this program are: 1) the identification of the fungal genes involved in the pathogenesis of Triticum species by S. nodorum and 2) identification of Triticum genes conferring SNB resistance. A combination of linkage and association mapping strategies will be used to study the genetics of host-pathogen interactions. Linkage mapping is a robust genetic analysis method that has been widely applied in plant and fungal genetic research. Association mapping is a novel gene mapping approach used extensively in human and animal genetic research. These studies will provide insight into the genetic basis of virulence and pathogenicity of a necrotrophic pathogen, and identify and characterize resistance genes in the host. This information will advance scientific knowledge in this discipline and has applications in breeding of disease resistant crops.","Agriculture and primary food production","Agriculture and primary food production","Crop Development Centre","McCartney, Curt","RGPIN ","Plant pathology","Plant and treebiology","Biologie v�g�tale et des arbres",3-5

"Over the next five years, the proposed work will examine the processes that control the exchange of carbon dioxide, water, and energy from selected sites in the Canadian boreal forest zone. A particular emphasis of the work is to study the impact of disturbance and silvicultural practices on the ability of the forest to sequester (capture and store) carbon dioxide. We will measure the fluxes (exchange rates) of carbon, water, and energy (CWE) between the atmosphere and the forest, examine how these fluxes change with season and from year-to-year, and develop a scheme to scale the flux of carbon dioxide from the site to the regional level. The work will contribute to the development of ecosystem models of carbon exchange and to models used to simulate the impact of climate change. Such work is basic to our ability to understand how the likely future climate change will impact our forests. Experiments will be conducted at sites in northern Ontario and northern Saskatchewan. In Ontario, the work will focus on the mixedwood forests located near Timmins. Three sites will be studied: a logged site, a juvenile, improved mixedwood site (17 years old), and an old, fully mature site (76 years old). In Saskatchewan, the experimental work will be conducted on a range of jack pine forest sites that are part of the Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites (BERMS) project.  The selected sites are part of a  chronosequence representing a series of stages of tree growth from juvenile (12 years old) to mature (31 years old) to old (90 years old). In studying a chronosequence we assume that we can recreate the trajectory of the changing CWE fluxes as the forest regrows after a disturbance. Effectively, we substitute space for time. 



The proposed work will support the training of two undergraduate students each year as summer research assistants. Two graduate students per year (either Masters or doctoral levels) will be trained. One post-doctoral candidate has been accepted for the first year of the grant and at least one more pdf is anticipated later in the funding period.

"Understanding the regulation of muscle metabolism is valuable due to the wide diversity amongst species in ability to exercise & in adjusting their muscles to function when subjected to environmental & energetic changes (stress). I study the ability to regulate fat (FAO) & carbohydrate oxidation (CHO) as an important mechanism to conserve muscle function.  My group will address several questions regarding muscle metabolism: 1) What are the key regulators that determine FAO & CHO between tissues, species & in response to stress? 2) What regulates the interaction between aerobic & anaerobic metabolism in muscles with hypoxia? 3) How do animals deal with multiple stressors (cold & hypoxia)? & 4) What are true metabolic adaptations to hypoxia at altitude?  Mainly we will concentrate on 2 steps in metabolism that determine the ability of mitochondria to oxidize fat (carnitine palmitoyltransferase, CPTI) or carbohydrates (pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDH).  Using trout will allow us to capitalize on the fact that fish have separate fast (white) & slow (red) muscle masses & may have multiple forms of important proteins involved in FAO. We will examine populations of mitochondria specializing in FAO & examine the expression & function of proteins that regulate FAO.  In mice we aim to define exercise fuel use in normal & low oxygen conditions. We will also explore decades-old observations that CHO is preferred & blood lactate levels are lower in chronic low oxygen.  This may involve a pathway shown in cancer cells to regulate aerobic & anaerobic metabolism in low oxygen.  Finally, we are working with a group of mouse species in Peru that live at different altitudes & therefore experience low oxygen for generations. This will give us the opportunity to define a true adaptation to low oxygen at the level of muscle metabolism. We will provide unique insight into vertebrate muscle remodeling from alternate models demonstrating conserved & divergent methods of regulating FAO & CHO. Genetically-based physiological mechanisms used by animals to live in low oxygen environments represent biological solutions applicable to human disease.

"This proposal relates to the acquisition of six portable seismic sensors to support earthquake engineering research activities at McGill University, �cole Polytechnique de Montr�al and University of New Brunswick. The sensors and their data acquisition system are all-in-one stations that can be deployed at single sites or in small synchronized arrays.  Ambient vibration measurements (AVM) in existing buildings are used to extract their essential dynamic characteristics (natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping effects), in view of predicting their dynamic response to earthquake. AVM at soil sites is used to evaluate the fundamental frequency of the site and the global amplification effects anticipated in the earthquake response of buildings at these locations. These site measurements are used in the preparation of seismic microzonation maps of a territory (the province of Qu�bec in this proposal). The portable sensors will also be used in the Structures Laboratory at �cole Polytechnique to supplement their sensitive instruments (to be acquired) for multi-point accurate measurements when large and or very flexible specimens are tested. This also includes shake table testing of flexible structural sub-assemblies, architectural components and flexible or flexibly-connected building operational components. All this work is carried out under the umbrella of the Canadian Seismic Research Network (CSRN) (2008-2013). UNB and McGill have also engaged in collaboration on the in situ identification of wood/hybrid heavy systems. This work is part of the research program elaborated in the September 2009 proposal for the NSERC Strategic Network on Innovative Wood Products and Building Systems (NEWBuildS) (2010-2015), currently under review. The proposed research to be carried out with this equipment finds critical applications in the improvement of the seismic provisions of the National Building Code of Canada for all building types, and in particular for wood/hybrid buildings that are not covered at present. Advances in seismic microzonation mapping will also lead to improved vulnerability and risk assessment methods for buildings and their architectural and functional components.

"The main goal of the proposed research program is to ensure preservation of the structural and functional security of essential infrastructure in the event of catastrophic climatic or natural events such as high intensity winds, severe ice storms and earthquakes. We define structural security as the ability of a structural system to sustain extreme loading in such a way that if and when structural failure happens, its mechanisms are predictable and controlled to preserve human safety and minimize repair costs and malfunction/outage durations. For interdependent systems and lifelines, security further implies that a failure or malfunction will not propagate in a domino (or cascading) effect. In true performance-based design, structural security is clearly stipulated as a design objective.

Three types of applications are specifically targeted for their critical importance in crisis situations: masts and towers supporting wireless telecommunications equipment (broadcast radio and television, radio emergency-response networks, cellular, automated control of electric supply installations); overhead power lines (mostly high-voltage transmission but issues are generic and apply to any voltage level); and operational and functional components (OFCs) located in post-critical buildings (our schools and emergency-response facilities, including emergency-preparedness centers). 

The general scientific approach is based on advanced computational mechanics to simulate the detailed response of structural systems subjected to various extreme dynamic loading events. These simulation models are calibrated with experimental results. In applications where results are not available, namely in buildings and telecommunications towers and masts, in situ ambient vibration measurements are planned for structural system identification of fundamental frequencies, mode shapes and damping. Parametric studies are then used to derive simplified rational design procedures which are necessary in design practice. Accurate (validated) detailed modelling of complex systems is lacking in the applications targeted.

"In the last several years proteomics methods have become a vital component of biochemical and biological research, having made possible the identification and characterization of individual proteins and the identification of hundreds to thousands of proteins in high-throughput proteomics experiments. One of the key research methods in this field is 2D gel electrophoresis, which separates a complex mixture of proteins into isolated protein spots on a gel, which may then be excised from the gel and identified by mass spectrometry. This system will permit rapid and precise automated excision of protein spots from a 2D gel with minimal contamination from outside sources, increasing the accuracy and throughput of proteomics experiments. Along with the existing 2D differential in-gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry capability at the University of Waterloo, this system would complete a proteomics workflow system at UW.

Some of the research that would be supported by this equipment includes: biochemical studies of nitric oxide, an important regulator of physiological processes like blood pressure, neuro-transmission, insulin release, memory storage and the immune response; stress response and biomarkers of stress in large mammals; and investigation of the cell cycle and programmed cell death mammalian cells and yeast as a model organism.

"Alberta's oil sands are the second largest oil reserves in the world, and in 2005 represented 39% of Canada's total crude oil production. The extraction of usable crude and equivalents from the tar sands, however, requires considerable effort and energy input, and current extraction techniques produce a large volume of tailings water as a byproduct. The most abundant contaminants found within tailings water are naphthenic acids (NAs), present at approximately 20-120 mg/L. The concentrations of NAs found in tailings water preclude the direct release of tailings water back to natural aquatic systems, resulting in accumulation of very large amounts of tailing water in ponds and artificial lakes surrounding upgrader facilities. We propose to investigate the use of algal species for extraction of NAs from tailings water. Algal species can accumulate, adsorb, and to a lesser degree metabolize NAs. The algae and accumulated NAs can then be filtered from tailings water, providing an effective means to remediate NA contaminated water. The filtered algae can be utilized for biodiesel production and as a soil additive for land reclamation efforts, providing both economic and environmental benefits. Algae oil can be produced from algae in a similar manner to production of vegetable oil, then esterified to produce biodiesel. The esterification reactions used to convert triglycerides and fatty acids to biodiesel can also esterify NAs, converting them into a non-acidic form similar to biodiesel. Residual organic material after oil extraction can be used as a soil additive to be used in land reclamation after oil sands mining, so minimal waste products are produced. Additionally, significant amounts of CO2 may be recovered from the flue gases emitted oil sands facilities, reducing net CO2 emissions. The long term goals of a remediation system such as this would be multi-functional- tailings water can be sufficiently treated for release or re-use, CO2 would be sequestered by algae, biodiesel and organic soil additive would be produced from algae, and NAs would be converted to methyl esters suitable as diesel fuel. The goals of this proposal are to study the feasibility of the various components involved in the remediation process described above.",Environment,Environment,Biology,"McConkey, Brendan","STPGP ",Bioremediation,Microbiology,Microbiologie,3-3
"High-throughput proteomics experiments and structural genomics efforts are generating a huge amount of interaction and structural data, but it will not be feasible or possible to characterize all biomolecular interactions at the level of structure. Effective means of modeling will be required for the majority of interactions of interest. The proposed research will develop methods to effectively model a target group of protein-protein interactions, and has the larger goal of developing methods for predicting any interaction.  Many protein-protein interactions are mediated by one structure recognizing a particular peptide sequence, often in a loop or unstructured region of the second protein. If this is the case, a recognition method that can dock a structured protein to an unstructured region will be needed to identify many relevant biological interactions. The proposed  research addresses this problem.

Identifying interactions within the cell provides insight into cell function, and furthers the goal of predicting how the cell will respond to changes, such as a change in environmental conditions or exposure to a drug. Specific goals of the research include development of computational tools to predict protein interactions using a vector characterization algorithm, application of this algorithm phosphopeptide and carbohydrate binding domains, and experimental verification of selected predicted interactions. The specific interactions targeted have a high degree of industrial and medical relevance. Phosphopeptide recognition is crucial in many signaling pathways and in the cell cycle, and understanding these interactions may provide insight into how the cell cycle could be regulated. Carbohydrate binding proteins are industrially important, with applications in fermentation, protein-purification, and biomass fuel systems, and are major targets for protein engineering and design.","Life sciences (including biotechnology)","Advancement of knowledge",Biology,"McConkey, Brendan","RGPIN ","Proteins and peptides, amino acids",Biochemistry,Biochimie,2-5

"Virtual environments are based on a computer display including visual images and sounds to give the user the feeling that he/she is actually in that computer generated scene. These programs are becoming increasingly available to the individual. Their applications range from training environments such as flight or driving simulators to entertainment such as games to rehabilitation training systems. A common element in all virutal environments is that the human user is exposed to an unnatural set of sensory inputs. This can cause disorientation and even simulator sickness. The vestibular system is a sensory organ in the inner ear that detects head movement, and produces reflex responses including stabilizing eye movements and balance reactions. In the past, I have developed a model of eye movement responses to vestibular inputs. Currently I am examining the potential of virtual reality environments as training to improve balance. The long term goal of my work is to develop a safe and effective virtual environment in which to study human balance control. In the proposed work, I will develop a model, or mathematical description, of how the brain takes sensory inputs related to balance control, and combines them to produce balance stabilizing muscle reactions. The model will incorporate the effect of training or experience in the virtual environment. I will then evaluate this model experimentally in two virtual environments. In the first environment, a visual virtual environment will be used as training to improve balance test scores. In the second, visual scene motion will be combined with actual subject motion, and the muscle responses will be recorded. As we age, our sensory systems and motor control responses degrade, which can result in balance problems and falls. My work will ultimately lead to an understanding of the changes in the brain that occur with disease and aging related to balance control, and how they can be counteracted through safe virtual reality training protocols.

"Critical or sensitive periods of development are times in which the brain is undergoing a rapid rate of growth and is susceptible to a variety of environmental influences.  Experiences such as exposure to stress and quality of social interactions during these periods can lead to relatively permanent effects on brain function.  Although much research has shown prenatal and neonatal life to be sensitive periods of development, adolescence has received less attention by researchers.  My lab has shown that adolescence is also be a time when ongoing development of the brain is shaped by stressors and social interactions. Our research to date has shown that mild social stress in adolescence leads to changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function, increases risk for anxiety-like and depressive behaviour, and leads to lasting changes in behavioural responses to drugs of abuse. Importantly, the same social instability procedure administered in adulthood did not have the same effects as in adolescence, which highlights the significance of the ontogenetic stage of the animal in the effects of stressors.  With this grant, we propose to investigate the neural basis for differences between adolescents and adults in drug-induced plasticity and the means by which stress confers risk on the developing brain in adolescence.  We will use immunohistochemistry and western blot techniques to examine several markers of plasticity in neural regions implicated in drug effects.  We also will characterize functional changes in the amygdala and hippocampus through the use of behavioural measures that rely on these neural structures, and to investigate mesolimbic system function using naturalistic reward in addition to drug-related reward. The proposed research will increase the understanding of adolescence as a time of sex-specific plasticity in brain development, and the role of environment in shaping individual differences in behaviour and brain function.",Psychology,"Advancement of knowledge",Psychology,"McCormick, Cheryl","RGPIN ","Behavioural neuroscience",Psychology,Psychologie,1-5

"Understanding mechanisms by how microbes are able to sense and interact with their environment remains a major challenge, and as such, a comprehensive and detailed understanding as to how most bacteria respond to environmental signals remains incomplete. This proposal uses genetic approaches to determine what streptococcal genes are turned on in specific environments. The methodology uses ""genetic trickery"", where upon gene induction the bacteria are ""tagged"", and we can use this information to predict genes that are required for bacterial survival within a specific niche. The information will then be utilized to design biochemical methods to determine the identity of the signals being sensed by the streptococci.

"My main research interests are concerned with how hormones regulate developmental responses in higher plants. Through NSERC Discovery Grant funding I have focused the efforts of my laboratory on the roles of a number of hormones including ethylene, gibberellins (GA) and in particular abscisic acid (ABA). However, recently with the advent of chemical genetics we now believe new insights can be gained on how small organic molecules regulate plant growth and development that were not possible using traditional molecular genetics approaches. To this end, we have established a chemical genetics program to dissect germination in Arabidopsis seeds. Using genotypic specific screens, we have identified a collection of chemicals that have similar properties to a group of compounds called strigolactones. Strigolactones were first identified as seed germination stimulants of parasitic weeds. Parasitic weeds are considered the most damaging agricultural agents in the developing world. In Africa alone, Striga species have infested up to two-thirds of the arable land and cause huge losses in crop yields. Parasitic plant seeds are highly dormant and only germinate when they sense strigolactones that are released by the host root. After this point, the root of the germinating seedling penetrates the host and develops a parasitic interaction with the host. Using our model system we have been able to show there is a close relationship between strigolactone action, ABA/GA signaling and light signaling in Arabidopsis. We will use a combination of chemical, genetics and molecular approaches to further understand these relationships. The identification of strigolactones using a a combined approach of chemical genetics with Arabidopsis genetics demonstrates the power of this new technology to identifying new molecules involved in plant growth. With funding from the NSERC Discovery Grants program we will have an opportunity for the first time to understand the molecular underpinnings of strigolactones in host-parasite interactions.",Agriculture,"Advancement of knowledge","Cell and Systems Biology","McCourt, Peter","RGPIN ","Gene regulation","Molecular biology","Biologie mol�culaire",1-5

"A molecular heterojunction combines the new technology of Molecular Electronics with the existing semiconductor devices at the core of the microelectronics industry.  We propose to fabricate and study such heterojunctions, in particular their interactions with light.  Using high performance optical spectroscopy, we will monitor the structure and dynamics of working molecular junctions with optical absorption in the visible and infrared regions, and with Raman scattering.  For example, the reflectivity of a molecular junction is determined by the optical properties of the molecule and semiconductor, and light may be used to probe these properties during junction operation.  The results provide information about structural changes in the junction in response to an applied voltage, and direct insight into the mechanism of junction function.  In addition, changes in light reflection or transmission may be used in computer and TV displays, and in devices which provide an interface between electronic and optical information.  Potential applications of molecular heterojunctions include data storage and processing, fiber optic communications, high performance computing, and inexpensive, efficient microelectronics.

"Hardware description languages (HDL) have remained at a low semantic level, and have limited abstraction capabilities.  These characteristics make the development of VLSI ASICs and FPGAs inherently more difficult and expensive.  Research in programming languages and their semantics has established a path toward specification/implementation languages which have much cleaner semantics and strong powers of abstraction.  It has been known that such languages could improve the processes of hardware description, synthesis, and verification.  But the lack of a method of bridging the large semantic gap between the more powerful languages and Boolean gates has prevented practical progress in this direction.  However, work by the applicant and a former PhD student has established an efficient means of synthesizing minimal gate implementations from these abstract languages.  This method is based on the computation of frontiers in extended Boolean domains.  The proposed work will: a) improve the theoretical basis of the earlier work, b) make the specification language richer and support the new features in the synthesizer, c) embed this specification langauge in Verilog, such that a full Verilog tool chain can be used in experiments, and d) in the longer term, extend this language into the asynchronous design domain which the VLSI community must sooner or later embrace.

"Our understanding of natural ecosystem functioning is currently limited by our capacity to observe complex environmental dynamics frequently and over large areas.  Remote sensing has long been identified as a key technology for supporting wildlife habitat analysis and other ecological applications, but its use in multi-disciplinary projects is not yet fully-developed.  This work is designed to strike a balance between applications-driven research and technology-driven methods development intended to improve the use of remote sensing science in an ecological context.  Specific challenges to be addressed include (i) developing new methods for characterizing vegetation phenology - recurring biophysical events such as spring greenup or budburst - using time series of satellite imagery that observe the earth on a daily basis, and (ii) establishing better methods for detecting and measuring landscape disturbance such as forest harvesting, insect damage, and wildfire.  The results of our research will contributes to contemporary management and conservation initiatives surrounding endangered wildlife and biodiversity, and are intended to assist anyone dealing with remote sensing technology in an ecological context.

"Ultra-high Strength Steels (UHSS) are ideal candidates for automotive anti-intrusion applications (i.e.

side-impact rails and roof reinforcements) while allowing the overall vehicle weight to be reduced, thereby

improving fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas and other harmful emissions. These alloys must be

protected from the corrosive Canadian road environment in order to maintain their structural integrity and meet

consumer durability expectations - continuous galvanizing (CG) being one of the most cost-effective ways of

accomplishing this goal. However, the thermal treatments required to achieve the required mechanical

properties are not necessarily compatible with the CG process. Furthermore, the relatively high alloy content

commonly encountere in UHSS often prohibits sufficient adherence of the Zn alloy coating - i.e. the coating

bath does not react sufficiently with the steel surface.

The aims of this project are twofold: (i) develop thermal treatments compatible with the capabilities of the CG

process such that the target mechanical properties are met (ii) assess the effect of a variety of process

atmospheres on the development of the surface chemistry and its impact on coating adherence. The first goal

will be accomplished by developing continuous cooling transormation diagrams for a pre-screened set of

industrial and custom fabricated alloys, in turn developing thermal treatments compatible with CG process

capabilities and ensuring that the target properties are met. The second goal will be realised by subjecting the

steels to the thermal treatments developed above under a variety of CG process atmospheres and determining

the adherence of the resultant coatings. The process of hot stamping/die quenching will also be explored for

UHSS grades which can be successfully coated, but which cannot meet the mechanical property requirements

due to insufficient cooling capabilities in the CG process.

"One of the means by which automobiles can be made more fuel efficient is by reducing their mass.  In order to achieve this, advanced high strength steels are being increasingly used in automotive applications as thinner cross-sections of these materials can be used while enhancing vehicle safety.  However, this necessitates the increased use of corrosion protection to maintain structural integrity and to meet consumer durability expectations, for which continuous galvanizing is among the most cost effective solutions.

However, the higher Mn content of these steels alters the surface chemistry and interfacial reactions occurring during continuous galvanizing in a manner which is not fully understood, although alloys containing up to 2wt% Mn are routinely galvanized.  The objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms and kinetics of the interfacial reactions occurring in the continuous galvanizing bath during the galvanizing of Mn-containing high strength dual phase (DP) steels.  Two projects are proposed, each of which will train a PhD student for this important sector of the Canadian economy.

The first project will examine the effect of Mn on the formation kinetics of the Fe2Al5 interfacial layer required for the production of formable pure Zn overlays.  The kinetics of this reaction on pure Fe have been previously explored by the applicant and this work will be extended to the interfacial reaction kinetics  of DP steels. The success of this project will aid the steel industry in properly managing their galvanizing process.

The second project will explore the mechanism by which the interfacial reactions can proceed.  It is well known that these steels have a MnO film on their surface, which should prevent successful galvanizing. There is at present an unknown mechanism by which this MnO film is removed and which allows the formation of the Fe2Al5 layer to proceed.  A proposed mechanism is the reduction of the MnO by the bath Al and this project will explore and attempt to prove this theory.  Success of this project will allow for the development of strategies to successfully coat more highly alloyed steels which cannot presently be galvanized.

"Nanostructured thermal-sprayed coatings for recovery boilers in the forestry industry



Thermal spraying is a process in which a high-temperature heat source is used to melt and accelerate micron-sized metal, ceramic, or alloy particles to build protective coatings on industrial machine parts. Molten and semi-molten particles impact and spread on the component surfaces until several layers of the coating are fabricated. These coatings provide protection against degradation caused by corrosion, erosion, or high temperatures. The versatility and cost-efficiency of thermal-sprayed coatings have increased their use in diverse industrial applications in aeronautics, automotives, forestry, mining, and petroleum. The proposed project will study the application of thermal-sprayed nanostructured yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings to provide protection against high temperature, corrosion, and cracking in recovery boilers used in pulp and paper processing. The objectives of the proposed research project are: i) to deposit and characterize a dense thermal barrier coating based on nanostructured yttria-stabilized zirconia, ii) to test the performance of the coating under conditions similar to recovery boilers, and iii) to facilitate the application of this innovative coating solution in industry. The proposed research project has been strategically designed to fabricate high-quality nanostructured ceramic protective coatings for high temperature boilers, provide practical training for undergraduate and graduate student researchers, and transfer the research results to companies in the pulp and paper industry.

"Determination and Application of Material Properties of Thermal-sprayed Coatings



Thermal spraying is a process in which a high-temperature heat source is used to melt and accelerate micron-sized metal, ceramic, or alloy particles to build thick protective coatings on industrial machine parts.

These coatings provide protection against degradation caused by corrosion, erosion, or high temperatures. The versatility and cost-efficiency of thermal-sprayed coatings have increased their use in diverse industrial applications in aeronautics, automotives, biomedical, mining, and petroleum. As the demand for more robust coatings increases, knowledge and improvement of the material properties of these coatings to withstand exhaustive industrial processes will be needed. The objectives of the proposed research program are: i) to develop a novel method of determining the thermal diffusivity of thermal-sprayed coatings and ii) to study the fundamental nature of the superior anti-wear performance of thermal-sprayed nanostructured titania coatings and their application in pipelines exposed to hydrogen sulfide corrosion cracking and oil-sand slurry wear. The determination of coating thermal diffusivities will facilitate the development of new types of coatings, with lower thermal diffusivities, which will allow improved part protection at higher operating temperatures. The application of nano titania coatings will reduce frequent maintenance, repair, and replacement of the piping and machine parts in the Canadian oil sand industry, reducing downtime and increasing profitability levels.

"My research focuses on the chemical and structural-state characterization of minerals (and their synthetic analogues) associated with magmatic ores.  The long-term goal is to apply obtained data as a means of quantifying the geological conditions under which these minerals developed.  Currently, I am most interested in applying data obtained from analyses of minerals in the Fe-Ni-Cu-PGE system to quantitatively assess primary conditions of crystallization and growth and secondary processes that may have modified them. 

This work currently involves two directives, the first involving Fe-Ni sulfides (Pyrrhotite Mineral Family, PMF).  Pyrrhotite is a family of Fe-deficient sulfides that constitute the most abundant sulfide in magmatic ore deposits.   The PMF exhibits fairly simple phase relations at T >350 �C, but complex relations below this, owing to the way that Fe ions and vacancies are arranged.  In general, two basic PMF minerals are known, hexagonal (hpo) and monoclinic (mpo) pyrrhotite, and understanding how the two vary in terms of modal abundance, their intergrowths, minor-element chemistry, etc. is critical to assessing how an ore body has evolved.  My goal is therefore to determine the hpo:mpo ratios in natural ore bodies to apply the data obtained as means of understanding how the chemistry and conditions of formation have been modified with time.  The second directive involves Platinum-Group Minerals (PGM) that host the economically and technologically important Platinum-Group Elements (PGE).  Traditionally, PGM have been poorly understood owing to their small grain sizes, complex and highly varied chemistries and because of their overall rarity.  However, PGE constitute important industrial commodities, owing to their use in high-tech industries (fuel cells, electronics) so an understanding of PGM and how they can be found is important.  My research goal is to resolve some of the outstanding complexities associated with these minerals, through analyses of the atomic arrangements, and to combine results from studies into their synthesis with field-based data as a means of understanding their formation.

"New evidence suggests that a variety of psychiatric disorders may be caused by alterations in learning and memory systems. Abnormalities in these different learning and memory systems, dynamic interactions between them, and interactions between these systems and other brain areas might mediate both normal and abnormal manifestations of thought and behaviour. The current research proposal is directly interested in unraveling these complex brain processes by utilizing a breakthrough paradigm for assessing different types of memories acquired by different systems on the same task. The visual discrimination task provides the opportunity to assess dorsal striatum, hippocampus, and amygdala learning and memory functions during acquisition of the same task and reveals what appears to be a novel subclass of associations and potential interactions that can occur between these neural systems. The specific aims of this research program are threefold: 1) provide further evidence that the competitive interactions between these systems represent examples of a novel subclass of competitive interactions. This aim will be achieved by running retention and reversal experiments in which one of these neural structures will be damaged after acquisition of the task or a set of experiments using the post-training memory consolidation paradigm in which the hypothesized necessary versus incidental associations will be manipulated; 2) gain an understanding of the consequences of blocking NMDA plasticity in these systems at different times during training. We will assess the effects of post-training, localized NMDA (CPP) blockade during visual discrimination acquisition; 3) obtain information about the consequences of blocking new protein synthesis in these same systems at different times during training. This will be achieved by assessing the effects of post-training, localized new protein synthesis blockade (anisomycin) during visual discrimination acquisition. Taken together, these experiments will give us a window into the dynamic and interactive nature of these neural systems with each other and provide important information about plasticity mechanisms supporting these complex brain functions and the localization of these processes.

Applied research will draw upon faculty expertise in the college's Energy Systems Engineering Technology Program, as well as Wind Turbine Technology, Civil Engineering, Instrumentation Control Engineering, and other programs, and will involve highly motivated college students.  Partners will come from eastern Ontario's fast-growing sustainable energy industries and local university researchers.  Projects will assist prototype development and field testing, improve efficiencies in new and existing technologies, and develop integrations of the variety of emerging technologies concerned with solar, geothermal, wind, and biomass energy with one another and with the existing power grid.  Typically, small and medium enterprises (SME's) in the field have focused upon a single technology (just solar, just wind, etc) as have researchers. Sustainable energy technology adoption will be greatly aided if 1) basic performance can be enhanced, 2) it can dovetail with conventional technology including the public power grid, and 3) multiple new or old technologies can be integrated into a supple and effective system.  Most SME's do not have research resources.  St. Lawrence College can leverage its comprehensive energy system programming with regional SME's and universities by facilitating collaborative applied research to improve and integrate the technologies.  SEARC and its research network are ready to launch almost 20  research projects in the first two years, with resources in place to promote the research enterprise, completing 60 projects in five years, and to commercialize results, while directly involving over 500 college students.

"The lipid composition of biological membranes is complex and most naturally occurring membrane proteins also have large, complex structures whose exact three-dimensional dispositions in the membrane are currently unknown. Therefore, in order to study the molecular mechanisms of lipid-protein interactions in a rigorous and systematic fashion, we plan to study model membrane systems containing one of a series of synthetic, amphiphilic alpha-helical polypeptides, which are known to span the lipid bilayer, and a variety of glycolipids or phospholipids. The alpha-helical peptides used will vary with regard to their length, the charge and hydrophobicity of their amino acid residues, and their conformation in the lipid bilayer. The phospholipids and glycolipids used will vary with regard to the length of their fatty acid chains and thus the thickness of the hydrophobic core of the bilayer membrane, and in the size, charge and hydrogen-bonding capacity of their polar headgroups, which are located on the bilayer surface. By using several different physical techniques, the nature and relative strengths of the various types (hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, etc.) of lipid-protein interactions which occur in these various simple model membrane systems can be determined and quantitated. This will lead to a better understanding of the interactions of membrane proteins with their host lipid bilayers in real biological membranes, and thus of how the structure and physical properties these lipid bilayers can modulate the structure and the function of various membrane proteins, many of which play key roles in cellular structure and function.

"As we walk around, we must control many segments in different directions. At the same time, we must different environmental factors that can challenge us both physically and mentally. This research program is dedicated to understanding the organisation, versatility and limitations of the control of human navigation during walking. The basic knowledge gained here has far reaching applications across areas related to artificial locomotion (e.g., robotics), bioengineering (musculo-skeletal enhancement), spatial enhancement (architecture and geomatics) and rehabilitation. The present proposal will concentrate on the study of a) the means of coordinating the lower limbs for propulsion and equilibrium in different directions simultaneously and b) the interaction of visual and inner ear (vestibular) information during different situations of navigation. These factors will be studied within environmental contexts found in real life situations imposing both physical (obstructions) and cognitive (competition of attentional resources) constraints. In addition to studying healthy adult populations, persons with visual problems and pre-adolescent children born pre-term (as compared to those born at term) will be studied. Three-dimensional measurements of body movement and the coordination of its segments will be investigated in all projects.

"Artificial nucleases are molecules capable of inducing single- or double-strand breaks in the DNA backbone.  Molecules that cleave DNA  upon activation with light are especially important in photodynamic therapy (PDT), a strategy that has been applied to the successful treatment of certain cancers and age-related macular degeneration.  Current clinical agents for PDT suffer from three major limitations:  (i) requirement for oxygen to function, (ii) minimum absorption of light at wavelengths most transparent to tissue, and (iii) inability to produce double-strand breaks.  This proposal outlines a research plan that is devoted to overcoming such limitations by introducing new  agents that elicit double-strand breaks in DNA under hypoxic conditions when activated with 700-900 nm light.  The first proposed family of DNA photocleavers is based on dinuclear Ru(II) complexes that absorb light >700 nm.  Extension of this family will include incorporation of Rh(II) to make hybrid multimetallic systems that cleave DNA in the absence of oxygen.  The multimetallic framework will provide two sites of reactivity for DNA cleavage.  Dual reactivity within 15-16 base pairs will introduce double-strand breaks which are more difficult for the cellular machinery to repair.  

     A related research stream involves  the jadomycins, a family of secondary metabolites that induces DNA strand scissions in the presence of Cu(II) or with light activation.  While  they fall short of the properties outlined for the ideal PDT agent, jadomycins exhibit cytotoxic activity against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria as well as some drug-resistant cancer cell lines. This research program will determine whether direct DNA cleavage contributes to the overall cytotoxicity of the jadomycins at intracellular Cu(II) concentrations.  In addition, the DNA photocleaving properties of the jadomycins will be investigated, with particular attention on the mechanism that predominates with Cu(II) activation versus light activation.  The role that L-digitoxose, a structural feature of jadomycin B, plays in DNA cleavage will also be probed to better understand how glycone incorporation aids in DNA recognition.

"The ancient rocks now exposed at the Earth's surface provide geologists with a glimpse into the processes that controlled their formation and gave rise to the metallic ore deposits that sustain our current standard of living.  In the Canadian Shield, the exposed rocks record a long and complex history involving an interplay between magmatism, metamorphism, deformation, and mineralization.  Geologists reconstruct the origin and evolution of these rocks by examining variations in mineralogy, textures, mineral chemistry, and isotope ratios.  This information allows us, in turn, to build conceptual models and methodologies to interpret the origin and evolution of rocks that formed in a variety of different tectonic settings.  The distribution and mineralogical character of metallic ore deposits can then be identified in the context of a robust geological, geochemical, and isotopic framework.



The research proposed here will investigate the relationships between metamorphism, magmatism, generation of crustal fluids, and hydrothermal mineralization in natural settings from across Canada.  These field setting will be selected for their potential to reveal the connections between the different processes that control the mineralogy, metal endowment, and isotopic signature of exposed rocks.  Documenting and understanding these connections will help enhance our understanding of the relative contributions from metamorphic, magmatic, and meteoric fluids to hydrothermal mineralization systems associated with ancient collisional belts.

"The fundamental objective of this research is to develop practical computer methods for modelling, analyzing and simulating the real-life operation and performance of complex electromagnetic systems, using large scale parallel computers.  The main purpose of this work is to provide high-speed computer tools for time sensitive applications that require high-resolution detection and identification of low-level interactions and small detail response characteristics in sensitive environments which contain and/or involve electromagnetic phenomena.  It is anticipated that valuable practical end-product applications of this research would range from simulating the delicate interactions between in vivo medical implants and low-power microwave communication signals, to rapid radar imaging and recognition of distant vessels at sea and airborne aircraft.  



A number of different computational analysis methods for electromagnetic systems have been developed and refined over the last few decades, and many are currently used extensively within the engineering community for a broad variety of applications.  However, the most effective methods are very computationally expensive, and can be cost-prohibitive, when they are applied to compute high accuracy analyses and simulations for the increasingly complex electromagnetic problems that arise in the modern world.  This result is basically due to the mathematical nature of the computational methods and the underlying requirements of parallel computing.  Essentially, the most accurate and reliable methods available are inherently sequential in nature, and therefore not well-suited to exploit the rapidly growingly potential of high performance parallel processing computers. 



The key to this research is based on the development of a new computational modelling kernel, which is both highly amenable to large scale parallel processing, and fully compatible with the advanced adaptive modelling techniques that are responsible for the accuracy and reliability of the most effective computational methods.

"For several decades, inorganic semiconductors such as silicon and gallium arsenide have dominated active device research and technology in electronics and photonics. In recent years interesting devices based on ""soft materials"" have started to appear on the scene. Both the literal flexibility of these organic and organic/inorganic composite materials and the ability to engineer a wide variety of interesting and unique properties will facilitate their use in an ever-widening sphere of applications. Relatively simple printing methods can be used for fabrication on flexible substrates, which will lead to applications that are not accessible in any other way.

In this exciting multidisciplinary field we focus on implementing novel functionality in the areas of 

                    - renewable energy generation and storage 

                    - highly interconnected complex systems

The former of these will lead to advances in solar cell technology and allow power to be stored and supplied on demand as required. The latter is particularly interesting, as it will allow the combination of electronic, ionic and photonic properties of the materials to be simultaneously exploited through the fabrication of ""intelligent structures"". These structures utilize the evolving temporal and spatial response of device arrays to act as neuromorphic processing systems. The interaction of these devices is mediated through electronic and ionic connectivity with both stimuli and response being in the photonic realm. Target applications include areal processing, retina analogues and more complex three-dimensional intelligent structures.

This work will serve to both generate important advances in this emerging field and produce the highly qualified people with the required multidisciplinary exposure to take advantage of its genesis. Being involved at the leading edge of this rapidly evolving area will position Canada well to exploit future commercialization opportunities.

"This research program addresses the physiological mechanisms of chronic sublethal Ni and Cu toxicity in rainbow trout, from initial disruption of homeostasis to final acclimation.  Investigations will follow the physiological disruption that occurs as metals are taken up from the water into various tissues (gills, liver, kidney, muscle) and, as the concentration of metal in tissues increases, distinguish between cellular defense systems that can detoxify and store (or eliminate) the metal and cellular elements that react with and are damaged by accumulated metal.  A method of partitioning bioaccumulated metal into distinct cellular pools representing potentially toxic forms of metal and detoxified forms will be linked to physiological responses. A suite of physiological responses will be assessed (e.g. immune function, stress response, vitamin A metabolism, respiratory function, ion regulation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)).  It is hypothesized that the primary disruptions will be in ion homeostasis and in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that these will occur in a biphasic manner during exposure, first ion homeostasis then ROS.  Under this hypothesis, the uptake of metal early in the exposure is expected to disrupt ion regulation (Cu interfering with Na and Ni with Mg). This is predicted because data from studies on the physiological effects of acute metal exposure show impacts on ion regulation. In the second phase of the exposure significant amounts of metal will have permeated into cells and as concentrations rise, detoxification mechanisms will be overwhelmed and ROS will be generated. The prediction in this case is that ROS induced pathophysiology will be directly related to increases in the subcellular fraction of metal in the toxic pool. Ni and Cu are expected to show contrasting results related to ion regulation and tissue bioaccumulation but similarities in the cellular partitioning and generation of ROS.  The studies are designed to understand the physiological responses, damage repair and adjustments in fish as they acclimate to metal exposure; the data will be of socio-economic relevance to better manage the impacts of metals in the environment.

"Over the past twenty years, revenue management (RM) - the controlled allocation and pricing of perishable inventories for different customer segments - has become a well-established practice in business and industry.  This mathematically complex application of industrial engineering, operations research, and information technology has had a substantial impact on the profitability of companies operating in such sectors as passenger transportation, the lodging industry, and automobile rental, and applications have spread into other areas such as broadcasting, the energy sector, and manufacturing.  More recently, the rapid growth of internet commerce, point-of-sale data capture, and other technologies has created new opportunities and challenges for RM.  To remain competitive, Canadian companies must develop and extend their RM capacity to accommodate these changes.



This program of research will extend RM methods in a number of directions. We will continue previous work on RM systems that adapt to consumers who time their purchases to periods of anticipated lower prices, develop approaches for real-time learning of and responses to changes in customer characteristics, and extend RM methods to the important cargo transportation sector.  Our goal is to develop methods that are both relevant to a broader range of businesses and more robust to rapid changes in the business environment.  We intend to train five master's students and three doctoral students in the theory and practice of RM.  The master's students will gain technical skills sufficient to support current and new implementations of RM systems, and the doctoral students will be able to extend the theory underlying emerging problems in the RM area.","Production and operations management","Manufacturing processes and products","Business, School of","McGill, Jeffrey","RGPGP ","Operations research and management science","Industrial engineering","G�nie industriel",3-3
"Low back injury is a major cost to Canadians. The spine is a very complex neural, muscular and skeletal system that thrives on optimal mechanical loading. However, it becomes painful and disabled when the mechanical loading is either too much or too little. This work is directed towards understanding biomechanical function of the low back, and using this fundamental knowledge as a foundation, developing better prevention and rehabilitation approaches. Our contributions in fundamental research has several thrusts. For example, our work deciphering injury mechanisms has shown that disc bulging and herniation have a distinct mechanical cause (repeated and prolonged flexion) that can be prevented and treated mechanically. The next phase is to understand the influence of twisting and torsion on this mechanism. In addition, the muscles of the spine create force and torque that allow movement and the support of loads. But first and foremost they must ensure that the flexible spinal column is stable otherwise it is at risk of buckling - another potent injury mechanism. Our work has improved methods to quantify stability and then has recognized perturbed muscle activation patterns in patients that may allow unstable conditions to occur, or are the result of pain. In this way instability is both a cause and consequence of injury. We have been pioneering approaches to correct these perturbed patterns as a component of therapy. Efficacy trials conducted by others show the approach is successful. We will continue to quantify stability during a wide range of activities to better understand the best activation strategies for muscles and passive tissues to achieve sufficient stability. This will require very robust modeling efforts that account for individual variability, together with features such as reflex activity. Our unique laboratory approach developed with years of NSERC support, combines both in vivo and in vitro approaches that has been used to improve evidence-based clinical decision making around the world.

The original magnet belonging to the INOVA 300 NMR spectrometer in the Department of Chemistry at UNB is beyond repair. We have considered three replacement options for this magnet; viz. a new Varian/Magnex magnet; a refurbished Oxford Instruments long-hold magnet; and a refurbished Varian/Oxford ALOX magnet. The latter option represents the most cost-effective solution, and will permit us to bring the 300 MHz instrument back into much-needed use. Prior to the demise of its magnet, the 300 MHz spectrometer was the primary walk-up instrument used by all graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and many undergraduates (approximately 50 researchers). This instrument was used around the clock prior to the failure of the magnet; we are currently relying on an ageing 1992 vintage 400 MHz UNITY instrument for all NMR spectroscopy carried out in the Department. 



At present, we have a significant backlog of samples that is having a negative impact on the productivity of all the research groups listed in the proposal. In addition, several groups have come to rely on specific capabilities of the INOVA 300 that are not available on the UNITY 400 instrument. Programs that will be supported include research into catalysis and energy storage; the synthesis and identification of natural products with potential medicinal and pharmaceutical properties; the development of new materials from biological sources such as wood fibres; and the preparation ans study of novel molecular magnets.

"A 'Hydrogen Economy' for the replacement of current energy technologies was first proposed in the 1970s, but it remains a tantalizing vision. The depletion of finite hydrocarbon resources, along with the environmental issues associated with fossil fuels and nuclear energy sources, currently lend much ungency to its development. One of the major barriers to a Hydrogen Economy is the storage and transportation of hydrogen as a fuel: H2 gas is not dense enough and its liquefaciton is difficult and expensive. A cheap and versatile hydrogen storage medium is required, which will absorb abd release H2 on demand.

This proposal seeks to develop such a hydroge storage medium, by deliberately destabilizing selected metal hydrides that contain large amounts of hydrogen, but which are intrinsically too stable. By deliberately reducing their stability, these metal hydrides can be engineered to release H2 gas at rates and temperatures appropriate for their use in a metal hydride based replacement for the conventional high pressure gas cylinder.","Energy resources (including production, exploration, processing, distribution and use)","Energy resources",Chemistry,"McGrady, GerardSean","CRDPJ ","Inorganic chemistry","Inorganic chemistry","Chimie inorganique",2-3
"Chemistry is the Science of change. We are interested in understanding chemical reactivity and the ephemeral intermediates that are produced in chemical reactions. We will pursue a multi-disciplinary program that explores the structure and bonding of inorganic molecues, and relates these features to their reactivity and chemical properties. 



A study of the structure and bonding displayed by hydride and sigma-bond complexes of the transition metals forms the central theme of the research proposal. Building on our successful characterization of 'agostic' interactions, we will expand our highly successful cutting-edge program that measures and interprets the charge density; i.e. the distribution of electrons in in small molecules. This will then be related back to their chemical properties. We will examine the intriguing quantum mechanical behaviour of in some metal hydride complexes, at the same time preparing new examples of complexes displaying this property.  We will also seek evidence for the behaviour of hydrogen fluoride, HF, as an intact molecular ligand in transition metal compounds.



A preliminary study has developed an apparatus for in activation of metal complexes using laser irradiation. NMR spectroscopy will be used to identify and characterize the reactive transient molecules generated by this technique. Photochemically generated species like these are key intermediates in important reactions in industry and chemical synthesis. We will also use the charge density techniques described above to study selected inorganic molecules that serve as models for metalloenzymes in biological systems. It is the electron distribution in these systems that determines their high activity and selectivity; charge density analysis will allow us to observe this electron distribution directly, and hopefully to understand their chemistry better.

"The process of temporal abstraction (TA) takes either raw or pre-processed stream data as input and produces context sensitive and qualitative interval based representations. Data Mining provides a mechanism to perform knowledge discovery on ever increasing volumes of data. That is, to transform it from data to information and ultimately to knowledge. Research has begun to apply TA concepts to the pre- processing steps of data mining. A number of limitations of existing temporal abstraction systems in particular relate to (1) their focus on one particular clinical event/condition, rather than creating an environment to explore multiple clinical events/conditions; (2) an inability to support complex abstracts that for example represent abstractions of behaviour across multiple streams and (3) an inability to support abstractions within a multidimensional context. These limitations are impacted by limitations within the supporting data mining principles for pre-processing temporally abstracted time series data.

There is enormous potential to data mine historical de-identified patient datasets to detect common trends and patterns, occurring prior to the onset of disease or illness, that have common contextual behaviours rather than the same exact numerical values. To enable this, the proposed research program will build on established collaborative research projects to establish new approaches to data mining that incorporate mechanisms to detect behaviours rather than actual values are required. These approaches will provide a highly flexible environment to support a range of clinical research projects. In addition, these new approaches need to function where the de-identified datasets are located in many different locations. 

The research foci proposed are innovative and emerging with significant potential, supporting many national, regional and UOIT research priorities and goals. 

The research program proposed will support the training of masters and PhD students thereby creating the next generation of Health Informatics high quality personnel.

Healthcare represents a significant portion (> 30%) of the Canadian National Budget. Health Informatics has the potential to reduce mortality and morbidity rates, improve quality of life and reduce health care costs. Intensive care units (ICUs) and in particular, Neonatal ICUs generate vast amounts of physiological patient data. Recent clinical research has shown the potential for common patterns in seemingly unrelated physiological data to potentially support earlier diagnosis of disease and the onset of illness in neonatal babies.

"Information technology is complex and the people who use the technology are themselves complex. Almost by definition, therefore, the fit between the technology and its users is complex. Technology today includes a plethora of applications, each includes a multitude of features and each interacts with other applications. There are also many computational devices/platforms which interact together. Those who use this technology have diverse tasks, skills, knowledge, expectations, and motivation. Although there is always room for general improvements to the design of any given technology, most individuals would benefit from having the technology designed specifically to fit their own particular needs. Designing technology to accommodate such individual differences, however, is very difficult to do. 

     The objectives of this research are to explore boundaries between adaptive (system-initiated) and adaptable (user-initiated) approaches to personalized technologies and to derive generalizable design principles. In adaptive designs, the system modifies the interface based on what it knows about the user; whereas in adaptable designs, it is the user who makes the adaptations to the interface. Both approaches have benefits and drawbacks. A third, less well known approach, called mixed-initiative design, is a hybrid in that it attempts to balance the benefits of the other two designs by having the system and the user work together to achieve a personalized interface. 

     Research questions include: (1) What aspects of the personalization process are users willing to let the system to do on their behalf and which do they want to control themselves? and (2) What factors impact users' willingness to personalize? For example, is it the type of application or device, or their level of expertise?

     The proposed research is in the field of human-computer interaction, with a strong linkage to software engineering. The research questions will be explored in the context of graphical user interfaces and various computational devices, including the desktop PC, electronic whiteboards, and handheld devices.

"Conventional user interfaces for computers predominantly use the familiar ""point-and-click"" style of interaction sometimes called WIMP (for Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointer).  These interfaces are easier to learn and use than older non-graphical interfaces, however they are often not the most efficient way to interact with a computer. In recent years, researchers have developed many new ways to interact with computers that are faster to operate, use screen space more efficiently, and/or take advantage of more advanced input hardware than the traditional mouse and keyboard. These techniques might, for example, allow the user to make quick mouse gestures to invoke commands, or might only popup controls on screen when the controls are needed. To date, however, these new techniques have been mostly applied to the problems of how to input and edit content such as text, documents, drawings, images, or 3D objects.



    This research will instead focus on visualization of data, ranging from network data structures to 3D medical images, and will develop interaction techniques that improve user interfaces for visualization. Many fields are faced with increasingly large data sets to visualize, where users need to be able to interactively navigate and modify the visual presentation of different portions or aspects of the data. To improve user interfaces for this beyond WIMP-style interaction, this research will adapt existing advanced input techniques, as well as develop new techniques. This will allow users to interact more quickly with visualizations, allowing them to navigate and view more data in less time, thereby enabling them to analyze and understand data faster. Such improvements could benefit many fields where visualization is--or could be--used, including bioinformatics, radiology, cancer research, software engineering, web navigation, databases, personal information management, digital libraries, social networks, and intelligence and security.

"The organization of biological objects such as cells or bacteria is critical to biological function. For example, in a tissue individual cells are organized into a specific arrangement necessary for correct function or in a bacterial biofilm, the organization of different bacterial species within the film determines the behaviour of the whole community. Microfluidic and ""soft-lithgraphy"" tools provide control over the spatial organization of mammalian cells, bacteria, and potentially fungi on a surface. We propose to use these tools to examine the effect of cell organization on biological function for applications in tissue engineering, environmental engineering and renewable fuels. A critical tool for understanding how biological function is influenced by cell organization is a microscope with the capacity to observe and characterize cell organization over time under the appropriate environmental conditions. This proposal requests the funds to obtain this key analytical tool for the proposed projects. Specifically the requested microscope will allow users to observe, at multiple time points, organization and changes in organization of cells, bacteria and fungi cultured in groups or as single cells in petri-dishes, slides or microfluidic devices. 



The requested equipment is critical to establish a BioZone imaging facility. All three co-applicants are members of BioZone, a collaborative facility with 46 researchers, focused on biological engineering that facilitates the sharing of infrastructure costs and expertise. Despite microscopes being a central tool for biological research, currently there is only one semi-functional microscope in BioZone shared among all three laboratories. The addition of imaging facilities to BioZone will allow members to undertake novel experiments, which are currently limited by a lack of imaging equipment. Furthermore, imaging resources will significantly enhance training of HQP in the BioZone facility by significantly improving access to imaging tools.

"Organ failure as a result of injury or disease is a widespread and increasing medical problem with immense personal and economic implications. Engineering artificial tissues is an important emerging strategy for treating patients who have suffered impaired tissue function.  To be an effective treatment option, a substitute tissue must provide adequate function, comparable to the native tissue it is replacing. Native tissues are comprised of many individual cells arranged in precisely defined patterns necessary to ensure correct function. Currently, engineered tissues only partially resemble native tissues in structure and do not function adequately to treat patients. Native tissues are assembled in the developing embryo. Various signalling molecules and interactions between the component cells define tissue organization. Artificially recapitulating the signalling and cell-cell interactions that organize tissues in an embryo offers a novel strategy for engineers to organize artificial tissues with appropriate structure and function. 

    )	The proposed research program will develop a strategy to engineer artificial tissue structure by manipulating a relatively simple signalling process. This process enables cells in a developing embryo to orient and align correctly relative to neighbouring cell across an entire sheet of multi-cellular tissue. The alignment of each cell depends on the relative levels of various signalling proteins in neighbouring cells. We will use molecular biology techniques to create populations of cells with modified levels of these signalling proteins. Using micro-patterning tools we will organize normal and modified populations of cells into defined patterns. Using fluorescent microscopy and live cell imaging we will characterize the effect of manipulating signalling between cells on the alignment and motion of individual cells in the patterned sheets.  

    )	Demonstrating how to exploit signalling processes that normally coordinate tissue organization in an embryo will lay a foundation to recreate more complex tissue assembly processes in the future. Exploiting such signalling mechanisms will provide engineers with new tools for generating functional artificial tissues.

"In the everyday world, the concept of a graph has seen an increasing number of applications, as for example in computer and transportation networks.  Of central importance to graph theory and many of its applications is the concept of a cycle.  Many algorithms and methods rely heavily on its properties, and much more needs to be discovered  in order to shed some light on some of the fundamental problems of combinatorics.  As one example, a famous problem known as the ""travelling salesman problem,"" asks one to find a ""shortest"" route for a salesman, starting from home, to visit several cities once, and return home.  In combinatorics, problems of this type are modelled by cycles in a graph.  While finding a ""good algorithm"" for a problem like this is unlikely, research on cycles may yield much improved methods.

Cycles in graphs are connected with the abstract notion of dependence, a concept found in numerous branches of mathematics.  In the 1930s, the American mathematician Hassler Whitney invented the concept of a matroid.  Whitney showed that various diverse mathematical objects, both combinatorial and otherwise, have certain common traits, and these traits can be elegantly described in terms of a matroid.  Since this time, the study of matroids has evolved into an important theory which has numerous applications, as for example in operations research.  Graph theory and cycles lie at the very heart of matroids, and there is a lively interplay between the two.  One of the early and distinguished pioneers of matroid theory, W. Tutte, once wrote ""If a theorem about graphs can be expressed in terms of edges and circuits only it probably exemplifies a more general theorem about matroids.""  In recent years, there has been a rising interest in the connection between graphs and matroids. My research seeks to deepen this connection and show that graphs play a much bigger role in matroid theory than was previously thought.","Mathematical sciences","Advancement of knowledge","Mathematics and Statistics","McGuinness, Sean","RGPIN ",Combinatorics,"Pure mathematics","Math�matiques pures",2-5

"Handheld wireless communications devices are now nearly ubiquitous in Canadian society. Users of wireless devices are demanding applications that allow them to take full advantage of the ability to communicate while they are mobile. The objective of this project is to integrate location awareness into wireless local area and wireless metropolitan area networks, such as IEEE 802.11 and 802.16 based networks, so the users and operators of these networks may take full advantage of the mobility and continuous connectivity offered by these networks.  This integration consists of finding new location estimation technologies as well as the development of applications that use location information.



The first stage of the project will focus on the development of location estimation techniques that can accurately locate mobile terminals without requiring additional hardware in the wireless network base stations or user terminals.  Machine learning and sequential estimation techniques will be used to obtain accurate location information from measurements already available within the wireless networks. When location estimation systems have been developed, applications and network control systems that use the location information will be created. Explorations to find the best methods of exchanging information between the location-estimation systems, user applications, and network control systems will be performed.  



This project will develop methods for the integration of the principles of location-aware computing into the standard wireless networks, as wireless local area networks, that the majority of Canadian now access every day.  This will expand the capabilities of these networks beyond just the replacement of wired networks.  Applications that take advantage of the mobile access these networks will then be enabled.

De plus, diff�rents usagers et applications peuvent utiliser et acc�der � diff�rents sous-ensembles de ces fonctionnalit�s. Nous nous int�ressons � l'�volution des fonctionnalit�s et du comportement des objets/logiciels dans le temps et � leur distribution selon les techniques dites ""orient�es aspect"", en particulier la programmation par vues, o� une vue est une construction logicielle r�alisant un r�le fonctionnel. Ces techniques permettent de modulariser les exigences qui ne peuvent pas �tre trait�es par les classes et les fonctions. Ce travail vise � d�velopper une m�thode et des outils supportant le d�veloppement d'applications orient�es objet et permettant aux objets i) de changer de comportement durant leur vie en activant ou d�sactivant des aspects fonctionnels sur demande, et ii) d'offrir diff�rents sous-ensembles de fonctionnalit�s dans un environnement distribu�.

Nous proposons une solution int�gr�e pour r�pondre � ces objectifs d'une mani�re unifi�e sans accumuler les co�ts de chacun de ces objectifs. Dans cette solution, nous utilisons la programmation par vues et les plates-formes distribu�es. Nous allons traiter particuli�rement les probl�mes suivants : i) distribution d'objets avec vues, ii) autoadaptation d'objets selon les appels de fonctions par les programmes clients et la pr�servation des droits d'acc�s de chacun de ces programmes � diff�rentes parties de l'objet en question d'une fa�on transparente, iii) partitionnement d'objets selon le treillis de Galois, et iv) gestion de cycle de vie d'objets en utilisant les techniques orient�es aspect.
