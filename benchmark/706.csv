"A fundamental goal for conservation and restoration ecology is to understand the mechanisms that explain why the species richness and productivity of vegetation are greater in some places than in others.  Answers to this question are essential for making informed predictions and recommendations associated with vegetation response to rapid climate change.  In the first major component of my research program, I will explore a new way of thinking about competitive ability in plants - one that recognizes that fitness under competition involves more than just growth (plant size) and survival; it also involves, most importantly, producing offspring.  Projects will examine how the deployment and allocation of plant meristems / buds affects all three components of fitness under competition - plant size, survival and fecundity, and they will test predictions about how these can be used to define a theory for the coexistence of many species without requiring that they compete weakly, and without requiring a heterogeneous physical environment.  In the second component of my research program, the above multi-trait-based approach to plant competitive ability will be tested in the specific context of competition for water using resource manipulation experiments within long-term field plots in natural vegetation along environmental gradients.  On a world-wide scale, water is the most significant limiting resource and object of competition in cropping systems.  Forecasters predict that, because of climate change and other anthropogenic effects, concerns for water supply in the 21st century will be what oil supply was in the last century.  I predict that water is the most limiting resource affecting plant competition and plant community structure and assembly even in non-arid environments, yet the vast majority of studies and theory in vegetation ecology emphasize competition for light and nutrients as the most important objects of competition and limitation on biomass production in natural vegetation. This research program will address this imbalance.

"Ischemic tissue damage occurs in conditions such as stroke and cardiac arrest when there is a significant block in blood flow to tissues.  To date we have only a poor understanding of intra- and intercellular signal events that govern ischemic cell death however cell surface calcium channels appear to play a key role.  Recent studies have implicated two members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family, TRPM2 and TRPM7, in regulating cell death in anoxia and oxidative stress.  These channels are newly identified calcium and cation channels and little data is available concerning their biochemistry, physiology or pathophysiology.  This research program proposes to use molecular biology, advanced confocal microscopy, and proteomic techniques to analyse the relationship between related TRPM class channels and how they govern cell death.  The proposed experiments are designed to determine the expression profiles of TRPM members, the mature forms of TRPM2 and TRPM7 proteins in neuronal cells and tissues and to determine the stoichiometry of TRPM channel subunits (TRPM2 and M7). Most importantly these studies are aimed at defining the protein-protein interactions involved in TRPM channel signaling and ultimately their role in cell death. Understanding TRPM channel interactions will provide new tools for ion channel research and novel targets for preventing cell death in ischemia.  This research program will also provide a unique opportunity for junior personnel to gain highly valued expertise in microscopy and proteomics as well as develop the skills to perform independent scientific research.

"Supported metals constitute the most important family of nanocatalysts used in industry. Although the literature is rich in studies detailing the surface structure and the evaluation of the catalytic efficiency of these materials used in various chemical reactions and at various conditions, the role of the metal-support interactions is not studied thoroughly. Moreover, in many cases, the findings are contradictory and create controversies. Although it is common belief that the support plays an important role in some case and it does not in other, the lack of a robust scientific methodology allowing for an objective evaluation leads to confusion, misunderstanding and decreases the usefulness of many scientific publications.

In this project, a team of researchers, working in various fields and having in common the utilization of such catalysts, propose a synergy able to make significant advances in this field. The proposed methodology includes the evaluation of the triple-phase (metal-support-reactants)-boundary (TPB) and the 2-phase (metal-reactants and support-reactants)-boundary (DPB) on various catalytic formulations and the link of these characteristics to (a) the catalytic efficiency; (b) the catalyst poisoning and (c) the regenerability of the catalytic formulations. The materials to be studied include catalysts in the following reactions : steam and dry reforming of organic molecules; Fischer-Tropsch and alcoholic synthesis; transformation of hemicelluloses into biodiesel; conversion of urea to dimethylcarbonate (a green fuel); use of iron-carbides containing Fe/Co-doped nanocarbons as catalysts or Sulphur-containing compounds adsorbents; plasma-driven production of nanocatalysts; core-shell nanocatalysts production, use and life-cycle analysis. 

The requested equipments are critical in this endeavour and they must be dedicated to this effort in order to have reasonable chances of success.

"Le comportement complexe et habituellement anisotropique des milieux granulaires est la principale cause de leur faible compr�hension. Les particules formant un milieu granulaire interagissent entre elles ainsi qu'avec leur milieu fluide et les parois de leur contenant via des forces dites de 'coh�sion' et d'adh�sion'. La complexit� augmente quand les particules sont nanom�triques et quand les interactions impliquent des phases liquides et la pr�sence des r�actions chimiques.

This project meets a need created, in 2001, by a new concept in the field of pharmaceutical processes: the Process Analytical Technologies (PAT). A PAT is defined as a tool to analyze/measure, understand and control the pharmaceutical manufacturing processes through real time analysis/monitoring of its critical parameters. The objective is to guarantee the quality of the end products and improve the production while minimizing the risks related to the environment, health and safety. The establishment of a PAT helps in : reducing the laboratory analyses by allowing on-line control during manufacturing; improving the robustness of the processes; and reducing the probability of marketing products which do not reach the market specifications imposed by the ruling organizations (FDA, Sant� Canada).



The general objective of the project is to develop and use PAT techniques and technologies in pharmaceutical processes. Processes implying divided solids (i.e. transport, mixing, tabletting) constitute the main target. The specific objectives are to: 1) Define methods of analysis, preferably on- and in-line, allowing to measure with precision and robustness the crucial parameters of the studied processes; 2) Use these analyses ""to measure and understand"" the behaviour of the processes; 3) Model the studied processes to simulate their operation and to develop scale-up knowledge; 4) Use the simulation tools to control the processes, aiming at improving the quality of the products by Design; 5) Adopt, on an industrial scale, protocols of operation.



The understanding of the particulate systems behaviour during their industrial handling and its role in the design of these processes constitute the scientific and technical challenges of the project.

"Small solid and liquid particles in the atmosphere, referred to as atmospheric aerosols, are important to both human health and to global climate.  In particular, the particles can be inhaled deep into the respiratory system and they also act as the nucleation sites for cloud droplet formation.  Although considerable activity has been given to characterizing the sources of these particles, the processes by which they can be chemically transformed in the atmosphere are not as well understood. In this proposal, we will experimentally examine the role that oxidation of these particles plays in the atmosphere, via a variety of gas-surface heterogeneous reactions. 



A suite of experiments will be performed using the primary oxidant in the atmosphere, the hydroxyl radical.  While present in low amounts, this highly reactive species is known to readily oxidize other gas-phase molecules.  Its surface chemistry is less well understood and so we will systematically study how it interacts with aerosol organic and halide constituents.  A second project will involve studies of aerosol nitrogen chemistry, in particular with regards to whether the gas-phase nitrate radical can chemically modify a set of toxic pollutants referred to as the PAHs, and whether aerosol amines can be oxidized.  Although many of these studies will be done with laboratory generated aerosols, we will also investigate the effects that arise when ambient particles from both urban and semi-rural locations are oxidized.  For all these experiments, environmental implications will be assessed and state-of-the-art instrumentation will be used. The goal is to understand the fundamental physical chemistry sufficiently well that this chemistry can be accurately incorporated into air quality and climate models.

The proposed research program is a continuation of ongoing research to parameterize the physical processes in the atmosphere for use in Global Climate Models (GCMs). These GCMs are used to predict climate and weather patterns including climate changes such as the phenomenon of global warming. However, the degree to which these models can accurately predict the observed climate is highly dependent upon their ability to realistically and efficiently represent the complex interaction between the various physical processes that determine the general circulation of the atmosphere. The goal of this research is to develop physically based parameterizations for these processes in order to make them more accurate, more computationally efficient and therefore more cost-effective. 



The proposed research includes the parameterization of the following physical processes. 

1. Heat, moisture and momentum transfer from the earth's surface layer to the atmospheric boundary layer which, constitute the lowest part of the troposphere that is directly affected by the presence of earth's surface. The focus of this research will be the stable and the free convective surface layer. 

2. The turbulence structure of the atmospheric boundary layer and its interaction with the surface layer. The main focus here will be the stable and the free convective boundary layer. Various forms of the mass-flux approach will be explored.

3. Boundary layer cloud formation and cloud structure where a statistical approach would be utilized. The focus will be on developing a generalized multi-parameter distribution function for cloud-conserved variables. 

4. Atmosphere-ocean interactions, particularly in high wind conditions.  

5. Momentum transport processes with the main focus of accounting for nonlocal behaviour.

"Image classification is necessary in many land-use applications. Since the advent of multi-spectral imagery a significant effort has been made in optimising techniques to allow their spectral characteristics to be fully exploited. However, there is a vast volume of panchromatic imagery (from aerial cameras and space borne sensors) that would need to be used when long-term studies of land-change are to be undertaken. In addition, there are new sensors such as airborne LIDAR and SAR systems that also provide panchromatic imagery and need to be fully exploited. The goal of this project is to develop improved methods and technologies for the use of panchromatic imagery captured from different remote sensing sensors for image classification applications. The proposed project aims to achieve four major objectives. First, the characteristics of panchromatic imagery from different sensors will be evaluated. Then, methods used for classifying multi-spectral images will be examined for panchromatic image classification. Second, new methods for panchromatic image classification will be developed and tested with respect to the characteristics of panchromatic imagery from different sensors. Innovative new techniques, such as hyper classifier algorithms will also be targeted. Third, with regards to the active sensor technology of LIDAR, the project proposes the development of a LIDAR image intensity catalogue by investigating the effects of sensor altitude, incidence angle of the laser beam, and the target reflectivity on the image intensity values so they can be integrated into the image classification process. Fourth, the project will evaluate the applicability of different image-to-image registration models using point/linear features to integrate of different panchromatic images in the classification process. Generally, the results of the project will contribute to both theory and practice of remote sensing image classification and they will attract the society's attention to the use of panchromatic imagery for different applications.","Sciences de la terre","Avancement des connaissances","Civil Engineering - A",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"A micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) resonator is a vibrating micro-structure embedded in a circuit. These devices are the basic components of a new generation of inexpensive and highly accurate circuit clocks, radio frequency (RF) filters, gas sensors, and gyroscopes. However, establishing a reliable design process for MEMS resonators has been an elusive goal. The main hurdle is that their dynamics are not well understood because of (i) the nonlinear nature of the actuating forces, (ii) the proportionally large motions involved, and (iii) and the multi-field coupling between the structural, electrostatic, electromagnetic, and fluidic forces.



   The applicant has a track-record of ground-breaking discoveries and innovative designs of MEMS resonators. His research program studies them with a goal of designing effective MEMS resonators and using them to build RF filters and gas sensors. Specifically, the research program will:

1) Exploit our existing models to investigate dynamic phenomena in MEMS resonators and facilitate using the resonators to design micro-sensors and to better control their response.

2) Extend our models to include contact / impact between micro-structures and the substrate to allow us to model the complete pull-in and lift-off sequence. 

3) Use MEMS resonators to design prototypes of IF and RF filters and a highly-sensitivity gas sensor.

4) Experimentally verify and fine-tune the models as well as evaluate the prototypes using a specially designed MEMS vibrometer (Polytec's MSV-100). 



   The research program outcomes will be on-chip filters and disposable noxious gas sensors enabling cheaper, more reliable wireless communications and safer homes, factories, and public spaces as well as Highly Qualified Personnel trained in the engineering of these products.

"The general objective of the proposed research program is to use and adapt local modeling methods in  various class of non-parametric models. Theoretical and practical aspects of the obtained estimators will be investigated. 

In particular, we shall focus on the following estimation problems: 

1. Extreme values related problems:  In many applied problems, one needs to quantify the asymptotic dependence structure of multivariate data in order to estimate probabilities of associated rare sets. Our aim in this project is to investigate local modeling techniques when applied to the estimation of copulas, dependence  functions, multivariate tail dependence measures, conditional probabilities associated to a random vector whose components are not necessarily jointly extreme. We also intend to use tail dependence measures and classical correlation coefficients to test independence of  multivariate extremes.  

2. Survival analysis: Analysis of time-to-event data is a problem frequently faced in various fields: medicine, public health, epidemiology, engineering, etc. There is a huge literature on this subject. Our scope for this project is to investigate local modeling for survival functions, regression, mean residual life functions, regression quantiles and various risk measures when : 

a)   the  lifetime and the censoring (or truncating)  time are univariate dependent variables.  

or 

b) the observed lifetimes are bivariate (or multivariate)  variables with unique or different censoring variables. 

3. Item Response Theory and Equipercentile Equating are two different topics that we intend to investigate by using local fitting. They  are related to Health Quality of Life, questionnaires and instruments used in health science.

"The increasing rate of man-made disasters and natural catastrophes affecting major urban areas requires comprehensive analysis and planning for emergency evacuation scenarios while harnessing the potential of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to expedite the evacuation process.  Despite the heightened attention to researching the subject over the past few years, the need still exists for integrating various transportation demand management and supply control strategies to synergize and optimize their potential benefits to emergency evacuation. Optimality refers to maximizing an objective such as maximizing the number of evacuees reaching safety, minimizing their travel times to safety or minimizing the exposure of evacuees to certain risks (e.g. chemical fumes etc.).  Demand management refers to controlling the number of evacuees moving in the transportation network from certain origins to certain destinations by controlling departure time and destination choice. Supply management refers to controlling the efficiency of the transportation network using traffic signal control, freeway control and dynamic routing.  The ideal output of an integrated evacuation management strategy is information and guidance to evacuees regarding when to evacuate, where to go and how to get there, in addition to a set of infrastructure control parameters such as, for instance, real time signal timing plans, contra-flow lane assignment (reversing the usual flow direction of a given lane) etc.  The objectives of this research are to: (1) formulate the integrated evacuation problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, (2) develop a set of solution algorithms based on parallel distributed Genetic Algorithms, and (3) implement the system on a High Performance Computing (HPC) grid. The novelty in this approach is rooted in the unprecedented integration of evacuation management strategies, the development of state of the art extensible solution algorithms based on artificial intelligence and the harnessing of computing power of newly emerging high performance multi-processor hardware.","Construction, transports et communications","D�veloppement du nord","Civil Engineering - A",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Global competition, aging population, global warming, scarcity and quality of natural resources, such as water and fossil energy, are among the most important challenges that our world is facing in order to meet basic human needs in a sustainable way.  These issues and many others increasingly affect the way manufacturers do business.  Traditionally speaking, a manufacturer is concerned about well-known performance measures such as yield maximization, productivity and quality improvement.  Nowadays and in addition to the above-indicated measures of performance, the same manufacturer has to deal with tighter government environmental regulations, continuously increasing levies on used products, and toxic-free substances used in the manufacturing of products.  Due to these restrictions and requirements, the proposed research program addresses these issues with the aim of designing environmentally conscious, sustainable manufacturing systems and reverse logistics systems, as well as supplementing the traditional performance measures by deploying additional profitable efforts.   Sustainability is the ability to ""meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.""  Reverse logistics activities are concerned with the backward flow of used products that will be reintegrated in the supply chain at the product level (reuse, repair), the component level (remanufacturing, cannibalization), or the material level (recycling).  The additional efforts required under these circumstances focus on cutting waste and reducing resource use.  These measures can be accomplished through: (1) the design of products made of toxic-free substances which helps in cutting the regulatory burdens, and also avoids a value-destroying incident in terms of a  company's reputation, and (2) the design of a process that uses less energy, which reduces toxic emissions and tempers the impact of high cost energy.  Accordingly, the proposed research program will focus on developing simulation and analytical models for the design and implementation of sustainable manufacturing systems as well as for reverse logistics systems.","Production et gestion des op�rations","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Industrial Engineering",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"The distance between unconventional natural gas reserves and markets creates major challenges for transporting the gas to consumption centers economically and safely. Natural gas continues to gain great importance in supplying energy to the industrialized world. A large portion of natural gas resources in the world are considered to be stranded. It is proposed that research be conducted towards the development of novel, advanced, and efficient technologies to exploit natural gas from offshore/remote areas. The technologies should be capable of processing and preparing natural gas to be transported either in a liquid form using conventional and less costly means of transportation or other transportation methods in a gaseous form but in a very cost effective manner.  The compactness of process equipment is of crucial significance in design of offshore and floating facilities as the footprint area is at a premium.  The main objective of this research program is to develop advanced technologies for natural gas production and processing especially for deep water, subsea, and ship-based systems.  It is proposed that the process equipment must allow efficient removal of impurities in natural gas under maritime and preferably subsea conditions and provide a low cost and compact means for efficient production and processing from remote locations.   



The ultimate objective in the long term will be to create a development program for optimal exploitation and utilization of unconventional natural gas reserves.  The technology and know how developed in this program can be exported to the world's rich gas regions long after the gas reserves in Canada's offshore are depleted.

The research is important to oil and gas companies and governments who seek to benefit from deep water, offshore oil and gas deposits in a safe and efficient manner.

"Electronic industry has dramatically advanced growth during the past few decades but still struggles to achieve the extreme specifications needed in many emerging applications that require ultra-wide band and high-speed signal transmission. The passive back bone of electronic system including interconnects and passive components have been identified as the main factors limiting system performance. Recently published technology roadmaps acknowledge the bandwidth limitation of interconnects and call for dramatic solutions to enable development of next generation electronic systems. In this proposal, an alternative solution for signaling in electronic systems by using bandpass interconnects instead of the conventional lowpass ones is proposed. These bandpass interconnects include substrate integrated waveguide-type structures, wireless interconnects that use antennas for launching and retrieving information and AC coupled interconnects that employ capacitive or inductive coupling for signal transfer. The bandpass feature of these interconnects brings new system capabilities such as wider bandwidth and lower transmission losses for the case of waveguides, and reduced delay and flexibility for the case of wireless interconnects. The AC coupled interconnects provide promising compact system integration capabilities. Each group opens new directions of innovative research for increasing data handling capacity of electronic systems. In this research program, system design considerations such as customizing driver and receiver blocks, dispersion compensation and signal and power integrity evaluations will be investigated. Development of enhanced passive components and integrated antennas, their miniaturization and signal integrity evaluations form another thrust of this research program. Electromagnetic bandgap structures continue to be a key element in engineering new components and power integrity solutions. The ultimate goal of this research is to address the design challenges in deployment of ultra wideband electronic systems.

"Silicon technology will be reaching its last node in year 2016.  This is due to the scaling down of the Silicon transistor towards its fundamental physical limitations of operation, causing a real barrier to further advancement.  New emerging nanotechnologies, based on new non-Silicon transistors and devices, are needed beyond the year 2016 to meet the projected performance of Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits and system-on-a-chip.  However, a large number of defects is expected due to the fabrication imperfections and non-deterministic self-Assembly process of these emerging nanotechnologies.  Such high defect density, although not as severe, is also expected for conventional Silicon technology once it reaches its sub-50 nm dimensions.  This causes a major limitation for sustaining the growth of Silicon technology requiring extensive work at the circuit level to overcome the presence of high density of defects.

This research program focus is on the development of novel circuit techniques robust to the presence of large number of defects in fabricated electronic chips.  The objective is to reach the needed defect-tolerance level by using initially hardware redundancy, at the transistor and small gate levels, to mask defective devices and components in conventional Silicon technology.  Then more robust circuit techniques will be developed for non-Silicon nanotechnology along with new logic circuit configurations based on emerging nanometer devices.  Canadian Microelectronics Corporation provides the design tools and access to advanced Silicon technologies.  Such sources will be used for the development of novel circuit techniques to overcome some of the limitations of emerging nanometer devices.  Circuit models of these nanoscale devices, especially Carbon Nanotube transistors and diodes, will be developed.  This research work is critical to maintain the desired manufacturing yield and the continuous advancement of semiconductor technology.  This research will help reduce the industrial need for circuit designers in the nanotechnology field, by providing excellent training opportunity for students at the device- and circuit-level.

"The sheer volume of information available over the Web has created the much-cited information overload problem whereby users are finding it cognitively stressful and difficult to find 'relevant' information. We are pursuing an Information Personalization (IP) research program that seeks to personalize the users web-based information mediation experience guided by a profile that characterizes their demographics, knowledge, interests, preferences, needs, goals and behavioural attitudes. Our IP approach extends beyond the prevailing techniques for personalizing the interface-level presentation of web-based information. Instead, we address the more complex issue of personalizing the actual information content delivered to users. 

Our research strategy is to work in concert with advances in web technology, in particular the Semantic Web. We recognize the potential of the Semantic Web to advance IP research, and therefore we propose to investigate the next generation of semantically powered reusable, shareable and interoperable IP methods and tools.  

The objective of the proposed research program is to develop a web-based personalized multimedia information and services delivery system for the Web. The proposed system will dynamically personalize the information content and service functionality with respect to both the user's context and profile. The automated personalization capabilities will be context-aware-i.e. the system will sense the user's current task in order to respond with relevant information and services; pervasive-i.e. the system will provide personalized responses whenever the user interacts with the Web; and proactive-i.e. the system will invoke the appropriate personalization mechanisms. The personalization environment developed will serve as a workbench to custom-design web applications with context-aware, proactive and pervasive personalization capabilities.

"Energy is an increasing global, national and regional concern. In May 2007, Olds College responded by adding

biofuel to its bio-industry research program and with significant industry support, opened the BioFuel

Technology Centre. The proposed project represents the second phase of this unique Olds College initiative.

The project is designed to address local industry needs, eliminate capacity and knowledge gaps, and support

both Federal policies (science and technology priorities and the associated renewable fuel content targets), and

provincial policies (Alberta Nine-Point Bioenergy Plan). The project also builds upon CFI and Alberta Energy

support exceeding $2.0 million. The critical gaps include: (1) a limited supply of biodiesel for institutional and

commercial trials, (2) insufficient knowledge related to the feasibility of alternative non-edible feedstocks for

biodiesel production (e.g. damaged or frozen canola and camelina), (3) insufficient knowledge and equipment

related to optimal ""technology packages"" for establishing biodiesel and biofuel processing facilities, and (4)

insufficient knowledge and equipment related to by-product optimization and commercialization. The project

involves three major activities: (1) expanding the capacity of the BioFuel Technology Centre, (2) agronomic

and processing trials of alternative non-edible oilseed feedstocks, and (3) the optimization of biodiesel

processes, by-products and technology packages to enhance commercialization. The expected project outcomes

include: (1) increased College and local industry capacity to address the expanding range of biodiesel and

biofuel issues, (2) the development of an applied ""biodiesel commercialization cluster"" in Alberta, and (3)

positive social, environmental and economic benefits that support sustainable rural development in Alberta.

relevance.","Non disponible","Non disponible","Private Sector Advisory Board",2,"CCIP  ","College and Community Innovation Program",Alberta,Alberta
"Obesity is related to a variety of pathologic conditions that include cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and renal insufficiency, all of which can lead to an early death and poor quality of life. In Canada, the rate of obesity and the health and economic issues associated with this condition have reached alarming levels. These have been met with increased efforts to better understand the mechanisms that lead to imbalances in metabolic function with some encouraging results, but still ineffective in controlling energy balance and curbing obesity in the long term. One possible reason for these shortcomings is that a great deal of attention has been given to brain circuits implicated in energy regulation, with relatively less attention paid to motivational aspects of feeding. Nevertheless, feeding in humans is often elicited and regulated by factors other than basic homeostatic imbalances. This proposal seeks to provide evidence that the stomach-derived hormone ghrelin targets brain regions important for the display of motivated behaviors. The results from the proposed studies will lead to a better understanding of the hormonal regulation of goal seeking behaviors, and ultimately may serve to develop novel approaches to curb cravings not only for high caloric foods, but also cravings for drugs of abuse.

"Search and Rescue (SAR) is one of the greatest humanitarian activities. It comprises the search for, and provision of aid to, persons, ships or other craft which are, or are feared to be, in distress or imminent danger. The objective of SAR is to locate and rescue survivors involved in a SAR incident. Search planning is a particularly important phase, especially when the location of the incident is unknown. Search planning may be seen as the optimal allocation of the available search resources. In this project, we propose to conduct research to develop algorithms for the multiple searchers problem in a multi-criteria context. The objective is to generate, in a reasonable time, near optimal operationally feasible plans for searches conducted in open and vast spaces. We will pay particular attention to uncertainty in detection capabilities, possibility of false alarms, presence of false targets and uncertainty on visibility parameters. The mathematical framework that we will use includes constraint programming, stochastic processes, multi-criteria mathematical programming, meta-heuristics, geographic terrain analysis, and simulation models. Our long term goal is to leverage this research effort with other research funding sources to develop a geographic decision support system prototype that implements multi-criteria evaluation and optimization algorithms based on terrain constraints, physical constraints, time constraints, detection capabilities, type of resources available, etc., and that takes into account the various uncertainties associated with SAR missions. This is in continuance with our past and current research in the area of search planning and decision support for Search and Rescue. The potential benefits are for the SAR organization in general, and for the Canadian public in particular. In an operational context, our research may translate into an increase in the chances of finding survivors, resulting in more saved lives. Another benefit is a potential decrease in the operations costs.

"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cancer related cause

of death in North American men. According to the Canadian Cancer Society and the U.S. National Cancer

Institute, one in six men will be diagnosed with PCa each year (about 25,000 in Canada and about 220,000 in

the US). Of these, more than 30,000 will die of the disease. These numbers are expected to double within the

next two decades when the baby boomer generation reaches the age of peak prevalence of PCa. If diagnosed

early, PCa can be managed with a long-term disease free survival rate above 90%.

Diagnosis of PCa is currently confirmed through ultrasound-guided systematic biopsy. Due to the multifocal

nature of PCa and the very low sensitivity of ultrasound in identifying cancerous regions in the prostate, this

biopsy regimen is scaled to the prostate gland in a blind manner. Ultrasound-guided systematic biopsy does not

provide an accurate picture of the distribution of cancer in the prostate.

We propose to develop real-time ultrasound-guided targeted biopsy. Specifically, by integrating

measurements of tissue elasticity with tissue typing information we can identify highly probable cancerous

tissue and significantly improve on the sensitivity and predictive value of ultrasound-guided systematic biopsy.

Real-time ultrasound-guided targeted biopsy will reduce the high rates of false negative and repeat biopsy

brought about by systematic biopsy. This research will improve the diagnosis and reduce the health costs for

millions of Canadians. In addition, this novel integration of ultrasound modalities will provide the foundation

for future innovation in prostate cancer diagnosis.

Five graduate students, three undergraduate students, and two technical staff members will be trained during

the term of this project. The medical imaging and computer assisted diagnostic expertise and interdisciplinary

skills gained from conducting this research are in high demand by Canadian biomedical technology companies,

hospitals and research institutes.

"Spinal pain is one of the most commonly reported forms of discomfort in the average workforce, leading to decreased quality of life, time away from work, and dramatic effects on performance. Health Canada estimates that musculoskeletal disorders, including back pain, cost society a total of $16.4 billion in direct (treatment and rehabilitation) costs and lost productivity. A parallel study reports more than $62 billion in lost productivity in the United States due to back pain, along with headaches and arthritis. Spinal injection of drugs has been an efficacious and safe approach to management. These injections are currently performed under the guidance of ionizing radiation-based imaging techniques, namely Computed Tomography (CT) and fluoroscopy, in specialized clinics, with often long wait times. Such clinics are also not widely available in non-metropolitan and rural areas. To alleviate these problems, this proposal explores the feasibility of performing the spinal injections in an office or less-specialized facilities. We bring together outstanding expertise in clinical sciences with investigators in computer science, from two leading institutions in computer-assisted surgery, to improve the management of spinal pain using ultrasound, under safe non-radiological imaging. We will develop and combine advanced ultrasound image processing techniques with fast, robust ultrasound to CT/MRI image registration algorithms to accurately inject needles in the spinal column. The research has the potential to make common procedures, such as nerve blocks and facet joint injections, available in an office environment using simple, robust, and affordable techniques. The system will also be applicable to the management of other musculoskeletal problems and for guiding needles for soft tissue biopsy (e.g., liver and kidney biopsies). The skills gained by the participants (including one postdoctoral fellow and three graduate students) will provide invaluable experience of interest to industry, government research labs and academia.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel",3,"CHRPJ ","Collaborative Health Research Projects",Ontario,Ontario
"This proposal focuses on the development of advanced computational methods for ultrasound image processing with applications in computer-assisted surgery and cancer diagnosis. Ultrasound imaging, in contrast to conventional imaging technologies, has significantly lower cost. It is also non-ionizing, which is especially important to children and pregnant women, and reduces potential harm to all patients and surgeons. 

   A computational framework will be created to integrate real-time ultrasound imaging with computer-assisted surgical procedures. By combining the segmentation of the anatomy from medical images with the registration of the patient to the surgical plan, this framework will enable real-time visualization of the anatomy throughout the surgery. This framework will also be used to generate probabilistic, rather than absolute, surface-based statistical anatomical atlases. The resulting atlases will be employed in the development of new atlas-to-patient registration techniques. Although the initial focus of this research will be on orthopaedic surgery, the framework will also be applied to soft tissue anatomy, with applications in radiotherapy and laparoscopic procedures.

   As part of this research program, new computing algorithms for processing ultrasound signals, with applications in cancer diagnosis, will be developed. These algorithms will examine a new method in tissue typing: raw ultrasound signals may contain tissue typing information that is not available from conventional ultrasound images. This hypothesis will be verified by extracting spectral and fractal features  from ultrasound signals collected from human tissue samples.  The correlation between the extracted features and the existence and grade of cancer will be investigated using advanced pattern recognition techniques. This research is expected to positively impact the lives of many Canadians suffering from prostate and other forms of cancers.

   This research offers HQP training opportunities in computer-assisted surgery and in image processing. Students will apply their technical knowledge to high-impact medical problems with practical implications.

"This proposal requests funding for accessories that will add confocal capabilities to a recently purchased microscope. The goal is to allow the study in yeast cells of RNA decay in real time. The co-applicant laboratories and their collaborators are studying a broad range of questions dealing with the trafficking and stability of RNA and RNA protein complexes in both budding and fission yeasts. The overall aim is to understand how RNA stability and localization influence gene expression and regulate important cellular functions like the cell division cycle, genome stability, ribosome biogenesis and responses to changes in growth conditions. All members of the group use yeast as a model system and study dynamic RNA expression. They all require a special microscopy setup that allows strong magnification and rapid scanning to capture RNA expression and decay in real time. Until few months ago, we were using a first generation Olympus confocal microscope that provides proper magnification but lacks the speed necessary to capture very dynamic molecules. Unfortunately, after 10 years and due to the extensive use the mechanical motor of this microscope stopped working. The company no longer manufactures spare parts. We do not have any alternative source to complete ongoing experiments and several projects funded by NSERC are on hold. A purchase of new system is well over the limit of NSERC grant budgets and there is no other open competition at this moment. Therefore, we propose here to buy just the confocal module and attach it to an existing epifluorescence microscope. In this way, we will be able to continue our research and enhance existing multiuser equipments.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Genes, Cells and Molecules",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Viroids and virusoids (viroid-like satellite RNAs) are small single-stranded (220-450 nucleotide) covalently closed circular (CCC) RNAs with no coding capacity for proteins (with the exception of the virusoid associated with the rice yellow mottle sobemovirus (scRYMV) which is the subject of this proposal) and are the smallest replicating circular RNA pathogens. They usually replicate through a ""rolling circle"" model producing larger concatemers which are then processed into monomeric forms either with a self-splicing hammerhead ribozyme (virusoids and viroids in the Avsunviroidae family) or by cellular enzymes. We reported (Collins et al, 1998.Virology 241:269-275) the characterization and sequence of this smallest scRYMV virusoid (220 nt) which depends on RYMV helper virus for replication and packaging. However, this is the smallest amongst all known viroids and virusoids and the only one to have an open reading (ORF) and codes for a basic 146/166 amino acid protein (16/18kD). Our goal is to unravel and comprehend the entire life cycle of this scRYMV. The objectives are: 1. Confirm the existence of 16/18 kD protein in RYMV infected rice by immunological assays and by mass spectroscopy. 2. Study the translation of this CCCRNA and in particular to demonstrate the internal initiation of translation of a Eukaryotic mRNA. 3. Determine the function (s) of this 16/18 kD protein and identify host proteins involved in the replication of a virusoid. 4.

"Wireless systems, like the Internet in the 90's will have a big social impact and will change our lives with greater horizon. Applications like remote medical assistance, just-in-time logistics systems, and mobile live video streaming conferencing will all take advantage of wireless. Slowly but surely, the 3G is becoming integrated in our daily lives. Meanwhile, the 4G prepares and confronts more important obstacles. Unlike its predecessors, the 4G introduces the convergence of various technologies. The 4G promises to integrate support and converge various technologies : local networks, such as WiFi and Bluetooth, metropolitan networks like WiMAX and global like GSM/WCDMA. Applications are getting more complex, but the technology is enabling it as well. The complexity is constantly increasing especially in wireless. The PHY layer needs to be reconfigurable; the MAC layer needs to support QoS and security; the network layer needs more complex algorithms to support more sophisticated network topologies like ad-hoc and mesh network. Moreover, since flexibility and performance are mandatory requirements, a cross layering approach design is essential. In this context, the main objective of this project is the definition of a complete design methodology dedicated to wireless systems. This methodology includes modeling, validation through simulation and verification and refinement stages that will be adapted to the wireless specificities presented above. By defining new approaches for modeling, simulation, formal verification and mapping to programmable platforms, we will contribute to the forecasted growth of this industry. Also, for the longer term it will allow Canadian industry to be more competitive by shortening the time to market while reducing the design cost.","Technologie de l'information, des ordinateurs et des r�seaux de communications","Avancement des connaissances","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"Specification, modeling, simulation and verification constitute essential and interrelated steps in any system design flow. The fact that the systems are more and more heterogeneous makes simulation more time consuming and necessitates complex and very powerful systems to run on. Acceleration mechanisms have to be explored and parallel programming paradigms such as transactional memories or atomic actions have to be used to provide a paradigm shift in order to efficiently verify and simulate such heterogeneity and complexity.

This challenge is considered by ITRS and other experts as one of the most important facing the research community. Current tools are based on mono-core processor paradigms and are becoming more and more inadequate in handling the simulation chores of such complex systems. 

Our objectives are:

-    )	Define a paradigm shift for modeling languages in order to take advantage of multicore hosts both for a more accurate modeling and simulation as well as more efficient simulation.

-    )	Proof of the concept by developing case studies and comparing to SystemC and SystemVerilog.

-    )	Investigate techniques to partition a model in order to increase simulation performance.

-    )	Develop an environment for assisted refinement of a system from high level descriptions to lower descriptions by using the same paradigm through different levels of abstraction.

-    )	Link to existing standards such as SystemC where it would be possible to refine high level abstraction descriptions to lower abstractions in SystemC.

"Database systems are an essential component of the software infrastructure for a wide range of business and scientific applications. One of the main problems with database systems is the significant cost and effort required for database administration and tuning. To address this problem, there has been a lot of research on making database systems more self-managing. For self-managing database systems, robustness is an objective that is becoming increasingly important in modern computing environments. One form of robustness is performance predictability. Instead of aiming for maximum performance, even if this performance is sensitive to system and workload conditions, self-managing database systems should aim for robust performance that is adequate for application needs and stable under different conditions. Users of database systems currently encode such predictability requirements as service-level objectives (e.g., response time must be below three seconds). Another form of robustness in database management is resilience to failures. The database should continue to be available to its users even in the face of hardware or software failures. Such ""always on"" operation is currently expected by most database users.



The long-term goal of this proposal is to provide these two kinds of robustness in database management. To this end, the proposed research will focus on two topics: robust automatic physical database design and high availability using virtualization. The first topic aims to provide performance robustness by improving the physical database design recommendations made by automatic database design tools. These tools can potentially degrade performance if the assumptions that they rely on do not hold, and the proposed research will address this problem. The second research topic aims to provide resilience to failures in a way that is cheaper and more fault tolerant than current solutions by relying on the capabilities of virtual machine monitors to flexibly migrate virtual machines among physical servers.

The realization of this vision will contribute to seamless integration between various processes required for design, construction and management of facilities. In essence, we seek to develop virtual environments that capture all features, resources and required processes to design, build and maintain a facility. Those virtual worlds enable levels of planning, optimization, learning and control that are not possible with today's technologies. 

We will also pursue demonstration applications of the collaborative framework and its implementation in the areas of scenario based planning, and constructability reviews. 

Scenario-based planning is envisioned ""as a process where a comprehensive model of the project is developed dynamically and interactively as the design matures"". Our proposed approach utilizes collaborative simulation to achieve accurate plans and to facilitate experimentation with project scenarios at varying levels of details.

"One of the most important interactions within an ecosystem is predation, as it is the mechanism by which energy and nutrients flow through an ecosystem.  A well adapted predator must be successful at capturing its prey; well adapted prey must be successful at escaping this fate.  Because such interactions are so important, both predators and prey have evolved a diverse array of strategies and tactics to tilt the outcome of these interactions in their favour.  The goal of my proposed research program is determine how predator-prey interactions are affected by a changing environment, and how such information may then be applied to restoring threatened populations.

     I will investigate how changing temperatures may impact the balance between predator and prey.  For all freshwater aquatic ecosystems within Canada, the energetic requirements of fish are determined by their environment.  What happens if this temperature increases?   To answer this question, I will first directly measure the relation for different species within an ecosystem.  My expectation is that both predator and prey will likely need more food in a warmer environment.  For the ecosystem, the implication is that warmer temperatures will require animals to more often risk death in order to obtain food.  I will also explore how changing sources of information will impact predator-prey interactions.  Both are known to use both visual and chemical senses and I want to know how use of these different senses may confer an advantage within a dynamic environment.  Understanding this process may make it possible to predict the consequences of changes in the aquatic ecosystem associated with changes in water clarity - a common consequence of man-made changes in the environment.  Finally, I will also explore whether consistent variation in the growth rates of fishes within a species is a consequence of genetic variation, or an adaptation to deal with environments that vary in the level of predation risk.  If the latter, I then hope to develop this idea as a tool in conserving endangered species.

"Climate change will have major impacts on the fish stocks in Canada's lakes. However, the exact nature of these likely impacts will determine what steps are needed to avert major economic and social impacts due to local loss of key species. This grant proposal seeks to develop a scientific basis for predicting the changes in distributions and population sizes of three important fish species (walleye, lake trout, and smallmouth bass), and the associated changes in biodiversity for inland lakes in eastern and central Canada. Climate change will have different effects on the availability of different water temperatures within a lake, depending on the morphometry of the lake; i.e., its depth and shape, and the extent of shallow areas. These same characteristics also determine the extent of contraction in lake surface area under a warming and drying climate. The impact on fish populations due to the resulting changes in thermal habitat within a lake will be affected by the movement behaviour of the fish and their interactions with other species. Understanding these complicated, interacting processes requires studies of the characteristics of the entire set of lakes on the landscape as well as quantitative modeling studies of fish populations within lakes. Our proposal will expand upon, and make use o concurrent lake mapping studies by natural resource agencies in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. This is a key element in any forecast of changing fish populations. The models to forecast future abundances of the three focal fish species will be based on these maps, empirical measurements of within lake movements, geographical comparisons of current fish communities, and a new generation of mathematical models that takes account of the distribution of sizes of individual fish, the nature of interactions between species, and the arrangement of different thermal habitats within the lake.

"Over the past two decades, medical imaging has become one of the main pillars of modern healthcare. The increasingly rich spectrum of available structural and functional imaging technologies provides exquisite medical data that offer tremendous opportunities for non-invasive visualization and quantitative analysis of anatomy and physiology. Applications, some of which are clinical realities, vary from basic computer-assisted diagnostics to elaborate image-guided interventions. Exploiting the enormous amounts of information embedded in such medical image data is, however, a very complicated task. In fact, the lack of efficient, accurate, and robust computational analysis techniques poses huge challenges that seriously hinder optimal extraction and use of image information in practice. 

The main objective of this research project is to advance the field of in-vivo imaging-based characterization and monitoring of human health. Specifically, it aims to enable quantitative assessment of morphology and function and to facilitate better understanding of the effects of various diseases and therapies. This will be achieved through the development novel techniques for automated analysis of anatomical and functional regions of interest, particularly in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) data. The applications targeted will focus on neurological (brain) and musculoskeletal (knee and hip) imaging. Advancing research applications in these important areas has tremendous impact and benefits to large sections of the population, considering our aging demographics where diseases like Parkinson's, stroke, and arthritis, are common, debilitating, and constitute a large fraction of the healthcare burden.

"My research program is focused on proteins known as ""pacemaker"" ion channels found on the surface on cells. These proteins allow potassium and sodium ions to flow in and out of cells which helps to produce electrical activity that is responsible for repetitive beating in the heart and repetitive firing nerve cells of the brain. I am interested in how these proteins work to let ions pass, in which tissues they are found and how their function and location in different organisms has evolved. These questions are important for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of ion passage into cells and the way in which spontaneous electrical impulses are generated. My studies are also important to identify key points in the evolution when important changes in pacemaker channel structure occurred, because these seem to correspond with the large changes in body plan that lead to the arrival of vertebrates. Finally, the research is critical for training and motivating young scientists, who in turn provide many of the new ideas and much enthusiasm, which can be then carried on to their future endeavors.

"This research program is targeted at developing viable remediation systems that can be scaled up for field applications. It is intended to develop engineering solutions to complex soil and water contamination problems that fully exploit the science behind the innovations. Such an approach requires a team effort and this style has provided us tremendous success where we have developed a technology to remediate polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated soils using photo-chemical methods. The technology is fast, efficient, does not require major infrastructure, adaptable to local operations and is currently being scaled up. PCBs are one of 12 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has identified, as needing immediate attention. They were widely used in dielectric fluids of capacitors and transformers, as additives in fire retardants, inks, paints and pesticides. Even though their manufacture and distribution are banned, an estimated third of the total US production of PCBs has been released to the environment.



In this proposal we intend to develop technologies to degrade PCBs when present (a) in transformer oil (b) on painted surfaces and to (b) investigate the application of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for remediation of PCBs and other pollutants. PCBs in transformer oil are a big problem with many countries mandating their destruction within a stipulated period of time. The presence of PCBs in painted surfaces is a major issue at the DEW line sites. While photo chemical methods seem to be the best way to degrade PCBs, the application of LEDs in the remediation industry is completely novel and even the science is barely established. The usage of highly efficient LEDs (and even sunlight under right conditions) will cut down the cost significantly and improve systems for remote application by using direct current. This can lead to major breakthroughs in technology development for contaminated matrices. The implications of this research can thus be far reaching.

"Our technologically driven world constantly demands improved performance in all classes of devices ranging from cellular phones to automotive sensors and from medical implants to hard disk read/write heads. This generally requires reduced geometric dimensions, and micro- and nanotechnology are therefore more and more often replacing conventional fabrication technologies. One fabrication approach delivering outstanding structure quality, and therefore device performance, is deep X-ray lithography (XRL) and the LIGA process. These techniques will finally be available in Canada as SyLMAND, the Synchrotron Laboratory for Micro and Nano Devices at the Canadian Light Source in Saskatoon, gets operational.

   XRL technologies allow for a broad range of applications, but still require significant research efforts to fully exploit the potential. Dr. Sven Achenbach therefore designed SyLMAND to become a unique research facility. His research will partly focus on XRL mask fabrication. Its quality limits the final results of the microstructures, and therefore needs to get optimized. Key issues include minimum micro feature resolution and maximum overall mask size. Better resolution allows for smaller, more advanced devices and better tolerances in larger components. Larger mask areas enable more devices to be processed at a time, or more complicated, distributed structures. At the same time, the technology must enable reliable and cost-effective mask fabrication, both of which impose major challenges. SyLMAND offers unique capabilities to develop and apply advanced masks.

   To effectively apply micro technology, individual micro components fabricated with an optimized mask need to get integrated into more complex micro systems. This is particularly complicated in XRL, and related research is an additional thrust.

   Results from the mask technology and systems integration areas will get merged to collaboratively develop next-generation wireless devices which are required, for instance, in cellular phones and wireless LANs.","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Electrical and Computer Engineering",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan

"The development of effective preservation and long-term storage techniques is a critical requirement for the successful clinical and commercial application of emerging cell-based technologies. With the efficacy of tissue engineering, cell and tissue transplantation, and transfusion medicine dependent on the native and induced characteristics of living cells, preserving the functional viability of cells and tissues remains one of the most important challenges facing reparative medicine. Desiccation and dry storage is emerging as an attractive process for preserving the biological structure and/or function of living systems at ambient temperatures.  Cell injury is related to the nature and the kinetics of the cellular response to the numerous physical and chemical changes that occur during drying and rehydration.  Over the past twenty years, enormous progress has been made understanding the response of nature systems (for example insects, plants, and nematodes) to desiccation and the molecular strategies that are responsible for nature desiccation-tolerance. Recently there has been an interest in extending studies on anhydrobiotic (life without water) organisms to include desiccation-sensitive mammalian cells. 



It is our hypothesis that desiccation stress in human red blood cells is accompanied by excessive oxidation of hemoglobin and loss of intracellular antioxidant activity. The end products of denatured hemoglobin (heme and free iron) contribute to membrane destabilization by oxidizing lipids and membrane proteins, enhancing the susceptibility of red blood cells to desicction-induced osmotic stress. This study is a concerted effort to bridge the current and emerging knowledge of the biophysical and molecular response of cells to desiccation and dry storage with the aim of accelerating existing efforts to enhance the post-rehydration function of dried cells for use in cell-based therapeutics.

"

I propose to examine how the mass transport (fluid dynamic mediated movement) of dissolved and particulate matter affects the productivity and functioning of aquatic environments.  It is reasonable to examine the interaction of organisms with fluid dynamics because mass transport affects essential biological and ecological processes such as the acquisition of resources, sexual reproduction, and larval dispersal. My specific interests involve aquatic plants and bivalves in the benthos (the water-substrate interface) of aquatic ecosystems. Aquatic plants and bivalves are ideal model systems in which to examine these processes as they are ubiquitous, major components, and fundamental constituents of aquatic ecosystems.  

     I have three specific objectives related to two of these essential processes, which I address through an interdisciplinary approach by combining fluid dynamics with physiology and ecology. The first is to examine how the shape of the aquatic plants affects water motion and transport of nutrients, which are needed for photosynthesis and growth.  The second is to examine the role of fluid dynamics in suspension feeding of bivalves and the mechanisms of how particle are captured, as these particles provide the food resources for bivalves and other suspension feeders.  The third is to examine the interaction of the water with structures on the lake/river bed that will influence the dispersal of larval bivalves and ultimately affect where they live. 

     By examining a variety of different aquatic systems, I plan to discover the underlying physical mechanism that influences mass transfer. This is an important area of inquiry that will provide insight into the functioning of aquatic ecosystems.  These processes have direct linkages to fisheries, contaminant transport, and restoration/remediation of ecosystems.  This is because aquatic plants and bivalves remove and concentrate water-borne materials in their tissues and/or waste products or transform them metabolically.  Consequently, these organisms are becoming increasingly valuable in the bioremediation of polluted and waste-water systems.

"During the current discovery grant a new surfactant characterization parameter, the characteristic curvature was introduced to describe the hydrophilic-lipophilic nature of ionic (Cc) and nonionic (Ccn) surfactants. Furthermore, these parameters were introduced into the Net-Average Curvature (NAC or NAC-HLD) equation of state for surfactant-oil-water (SOW) systems. The NAC-HLD was shown to be able to predict the curvature of microemulsion aggregates formulated with anionic, nonionic and mixtures of anionic-nonionic surfactant mixtures, a first in colloid science and technology. This grant application involves three objectives to advance the understanding and use of the NAC-HLD equation of state. The first objective involves the development of an ""expert system"" that based on the NAC-HLD equation can predict not only curvature and interfacial tensions, but also phase transitions, solubilization, densities, and incorporate new models to predict aggregate shape, microemulsion viscosity, and emulsion stability. The second objective seeks to find the linkage between the empirical relations built into the NAC-HLD models and molecular interactions, as defined by characteristic interaction distances that can be expressed as curvature terms. The third and final objective involves the use of the NAC-HLD model in designing SOW separation methods, with special emphasis in the study of the dynamic aspects of solubilization and phase transitions in microemulsions.  The project involves the training of 3 PhD students (one for each objective) and 8-10 undergraduate summer students who would aid in the experimental components of objectives 1 and 3. The expected outcome of these studies involve a software (expert system) that can be used by formulators of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, detergents, emulsifiers and de-emulsifiers for various industrial processes, including oil extraction operations. Furthermore, the new separation processes involved in objective 3 may open the door to the use of ""green solvents"" and of separation processes that do not involve evaporation (high energy input) to produce a clean oil product.","Produits chimiques industriels (solvants, r�sines)","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"The Researchers propose to work together with MDS-Nordion to add value to their growing line of Nuclear Medicine radiometals. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) are two imaging modalities that our aging population will depend upon for the early detection of disease, particularly in the area of oncology. PET has become the ""gold standard"" in the early detection of cancer which currently relies on the use of fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG). It is crucial to the health of Canadians that new promising radiopharmaceuticals, more specific for disease processes, be developed for both PET and SPECT. In order to achieve this goal new radiolabelling methods and chemistry must be developed. The sales of imaging agents alone have been projected to be at a 5 billion dollar market world-wide by 2009, with imaging agents for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) representing the fastest growing class of agents. Much of this advancement is being made possible by the synthetic production of biomolecules (e.g. peptides, lipids, oligosaccharides, oligonucleotides and antibodies) with specific and high affinity for cancer biomarkers. However the development of these ligands into viable imaging agents has not yet been realized due to the lack of a robust, reproducible, high-yielding and rapid method for introducing the radioisotope of choice into these biomolecules to give chemically stable entities. The researchers propose to develop the chemistry to incorporate two of these radiometals, Ga-68 and In-111, into biological molecules such as Peptides, Proteins, Oligonucleotides, Carbohydrates and Fatty Acids and to evaluate their biological properties as potential imaging or therapy agents. They intend to expand on the radiochemistry already developed in their labs to prepare coordination chelate derivatives that can be used to label a wide variety of  target compounds.

"In many industrial and research processes there is an interaction between an electric field and flow of fluids or gases. Among others this happens in all applications involving small particles, for example in electrostatic precipitators used in environmental protection. A phenomenon called the electric corona discharge is typically generated to electrically charge the particles, so that electric forces can be used to control the particle's motion. The electric corona discharge is a complex physical process relying on avalanche ionization of the gas molecules, but it also results in motion of the ambient gas, called the secondary electrohydrodynamic flow, or ionic wind. This flow can be sometimes beneficial, but is often a nuisance disturbing the intended functioning of a device. In both cases numerical simulation can be helpful in garnering better understanding of these complex phenomena, and the design and optimization of electrostatic devices.

   The proposed research program will first deal with the development of a new numerical algorithm and computer program, which can be used for simulation of the electric corona discharge. The algorithm will incorporate avalanche ionization, attachment and recombination, and all essential ionic reactions and species in pure gases and mixtures. An efficient and accurate corona model will be a prerequisite for the gas flow analysis. Another area where the fluid-electric field interaction plays an important role is microfluidics. Small amounts of fluid, either flowing continuously in a microchannel, or in the form of droplets, are handled in order to perform chemical microreactions. In the proposed research program, the dynamics of droplet deformation and transportation in digital microfluidics will be simulated numerically. Pumping of fluids in microfluidics can be achieved in many different ways and the most promising is based on the AC electroosmosis effect. Investigations of this effect published in the current literature are based on an extremely simplistic model. A new more complex model will be developed, which will take into account a more complete description of the process. Then a numerical algorithm will be created and the efficiency of fluid pumping will be investigated.

"Online environments are communities of interest whose interactions take place primarily, or perhaps exclusively, over communications infrastructures (including wired and wireless Internet, telephone, and sensor networks). Examples of online environments include e-health, e-government, e-business, e-commerce, and e-learning. Security and privacy are essential services that must be tightly integrated with the design and implementation of such environments.



This research program will focus on the use of combinations of cryptographic and non-cryptographic techniques to create security / privacy technologies that are effective and that can be widely deployed. Three areas are of particular interest: access control (making use of policy-based cryptography), credential infrastructures (making use of anonymous proofs of attribute ownership), and secure electronic voting (making use of end-to-end verifiable e-voting technologies). In all three areas, the concepts are built on firm underlying mathematics and proofs of security, but questions of efficiency, usability, and abuse prevention still need to be explored for a number of environments, as well as determination of appropriate infrastructural components and operational procedures.



Our approach will be to combine cryptographic techniques with policy infrastructures, biometrics, authorization mechanisms, semi-trusted hardware, and other technologies to create deployable solutions for specific environments.

"Ovulation is a fundamental event in the reproductive process of all mammalian species. Ovulation failure or untimely ovulation has a profound impact on fertility. Exciting data from the applicant's laboratory has now cast new light on factors responsible for eliciting the ovulatory cascade. Results document the existence of a novel ovulation-inducing factor (OIF) in seminal plasma, and provide rationale for the hypothesis that OIF is widely conserved among mammalian species as a mechanism for controlling the timing of ovulation. Ovulation in mammals may be classified as induced (i.e., elicited by copulatory stimuli) or spontaneous (i.e., elicited by an endogenous endocrine rhythm). However, a phylogenic continuum exists between the extremes of induced and spontaneous ovulators, and some mechanisms are common to both. In a series of pioneering studies, we have recently documented: 1) the existence of a protein with a relatively large molecular weight (>30 kD) in the seminal plasma of llamas, alpacas (both induced ovulators), and cattle (a spontaneous ovulator) capable of eliciting ovulation; 2) that OIF in seminal plasma acts via a systemic rather than a local route; 3) that OIF in seminal plasma is a potent stimulator of LH release; and 4) that OIF-induced elevation of circulating LH is associated with enhanced luteal gland development and secretion. The discovery of OIF in representatives of both induced and spontaneous ovulators is novel and has broad implications on scientific understanding of fertility in all species. The specific objectives of the proposed study are to 1) isolate, purify and characterize the biochemical composition of OIF, 2) determine the extent to which OIF is conserved among species, 3) determine the mechanism of action of OIF in eliciting ovulation and luteogenesis, and 4) determine the tissue source of OIF. Characterization of an ovulation-inducing factor in semen will have a profound impact on, and fundamentally challenge, traditional concepts of the ovulatory process in all mammals. An important application of this research will involve the diagnosis of previously unknown causes of male- and female-factor infertility, and the development of alternative ways of improving or preventing conception.

"Polyploids, organisms with an extra set of chromosomes, are common among plants and several crop plants are polyploid.  Polyploidy can lead to novel morphological and developmental characteristics, larger cell sizes, and new gene functions and expression patterns.  The formation of polyploids often involves hybridization (crossing) between two species. The goal of this research is to understand the consequences of polyploidy and cross-species hybridization on gene expression with a focus on patterns of RNA splicing (removal of regions of the RNA during gene expression).  I will assay the expression and RNA splicing of genes duplicated by polyploidy in Brassica napus, canola, including genes involved in specifying traits of agronomic importance such as seed oil synthesis and disease resistance.  I will detect novel RNA splicing patterns that appear in plant hybrids during the first generation after a cross is made, using new technology to study RNA splicing patterns on a genome-wide scale in a model plant hybrid.  The proposed research will provide the first insights into differences in RNA splicing patterns between duplicated genes in polyploid plants, and the first information on the prevalence of novel RNA splicing patterns that occur in hybrid plants and the types of genes that are affected.  This research on RNA splicing in polyploids and hybrids is likely to have an impact on the fields of plant molecular biology, plant genomics, and molecular evolution.  Some duplicate genes play a role in specifying traits of agronomic significance in plants, and some RNA splicing patterns in duplicated genes may be involved in conferring traits selected for during plant breeding. In particular, polyploid canola is important to Canada's economy and food supply and what is learned from studying RNA splicing in canola may lead to improvement of this crop plant.  Understanding how RNA splicing patterns can change gene expression and function may lead to using RNA splicing as a tool for biotechnology applications to design crops with altered expression of genes of interest to create or improve desired characteristics.

"My work is at the interface of analytic geometry and commutative algebra, two major branches of modern mathematics with applications in science and engineering. They deal with the analysis of polynomial and analytic functions and the geometry of the spaces on which they live. The subject of my current research program is the study of the local degeneracies in mappings. Such minute degeneracies can completely destroy the geometric regularity of the objects defined by the mappings, and hence it is important to know how to detect them. The main task of my program is to establish simple algebraic criteria to control the local behaviour of a mapping. This research provides opportunities for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and involves international collaboration with other mathematicians.

"The origin of new species remains the central and most elusive question in evolutionary biology.  In marine environments, the problem of genetic divergence and speciation is especially complex because the barriers to genetic exchange that are generally essential for allowing divergence to occur are far more subtle than in terrestrial systems.  Nevertheless, species can and do form rapidly in the sea.  I use population genetics to identify the fundamental processes that drive genetic diversification and speciation in aquatic organisms.  By comparing patterns of genetic structure among several species, I ask whether the ability to disperse as larvae in the plankton provides the best explanation for the patterns observed.  Does high dispersal potential lead to high population connectivity and reduce the likelihood that any one population will become genetically distinct through processes like random genetic drift or natural selection?  Or, has the history of growth and geographic distribution left a lasting signature on the present-day patterns of genetic structure?  If so, how important were these past events to the accumulation of genetic differences among populations or to the formation of new species?  To isolate the evolutionary influences of biology and history I focus on the marine invertebrate fauna of the north Atlantic because many of these species have been profoundly influenced by recent patterns of glacial advance and retreat throughout the Pleistocene.  During this time much of the marine intertidal community of the northwest Atlantic was completely replaced by colonizers that dispersed across the Arctic from the Pacific or the northeast Atlantic.  These new arrivals brought with them new genetic material, and by applying coalescent theory I will use DNA sequences to look back in time and reconstruct the processes driving modern day patterns of genetic structure.  This research will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving the accumulation of genetic divergence among populations and isolate the relative importance of both physical and biological factors to the process of speciation in the sea.

"The objective of this long-term project is to develop analytical tools that are needed by structural engineers to design high-rise concrete wall buildings to tolerate the ground motions due to the expected design level earthquakes. The outcome from this research will be new and revised building code provisions that will reduce the seismic hazard in high-rise buildings.



The general methodology that will be used is to develop complex analytical models that capture the phenomenon, calibrate the analytical model with results from large-scale experimental studies, and use the experimentally-calibrated analytical models to develop simplified procedures that can be applied by practicing engineers. 



Over the next five years, the research will focus on: (i) effective flexural stiffness of high-rise concrete walls accounting for flexural cracking over the height due to higher mode effects, (ii) a simplified procedure that can be used with response spectrum analysis results to account for dynamic magnification of shear force in high-rise concrete walls, (iii) a method to account for the shear strength enhancement of high-rise core walls provided by floor slabs surrounding the walls, and (iv) design of gravity columns for seismic displacements of high-rise concrete wall buildings.

"The high demand of energy requires the safe transport of gaseous and liquid energy resources from northern regions to areas of demand. Recently, the advance in metallurgy has allowed the manufacturing of high strength steel pipelines for the containment and transport of such material. While these high strength pipelines allow for the reduction of the initial cost by reducing the wall thickness required, they are also susceptible to ground movements that can cause large deformations. Such ground movements are primarily due to movement of ground slopes and relative settlement of areas of freezing and thawing. In severe ground movement cases, these large deformations can lead to loss of containment with very high impact on the industry and the environment. The University of Alberta in collaboration with the pipeline industry has been extensively studying the large deformations of pipelines in the forms of wrinkles and buckles and has identified that a major factor for the initiation of buckles in a pipeline is the amount and distribution of the initial imperfections in the pipeline profile (e.g. out or roundness, out of straightness, ripples). While numerical models are able to predict the behaviour of the pipeline based on a certain distribution of initial imperfections, no data is available on the pipeline profile and the associated initial imperfections. The current project proposes measuring the amount of initial imperfections within manufactured pipelines and comparing the different pipeline manufacturers that are frequently employed in the industry. The proposed project relies on manufacturing special devices and the purchase of high resolution camera systems that are able to quickly profile the pipeline with very high accuracy. The results will help categorize the type, extent and distribution of the initial imperfections and will allow for accurate modelling of energy pipelines subjected to large deformations.","P�trole, gaz et charbon","Ressources d'�nergie","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Alberta,Alberta
"Diarthrodial joints are the site of articulation of two bones against each other (e.g. knee, hip and shoulder). The integrity of diarthrodial joints is an important factor for maintaining healthy lifestyles for individuals. There are different passive load bearing components for diarthrodial joints. Ligaments limit the allowed relative motions between the bones and act as sensors for excessive joint deformations. Articular cartilage transfers the compressive load between the two articulating surfaces. The fluid of the joint helps maintain a very low coefficient of friction and finally peripheral structures (meniscus, glenoid labrum and acetabular labrum in the knee, shoulder and hip respectively) confine the joint and enhance load bearing across the joint. The current proposal is divided into two subgroups. The first is the study of the mechanical properties of and the structural requirements for the healthy components of diarthrodial joints and comparing them with those of symptomatic ones. The dependence of the mechanical properties on age will also be investigated. The design and repair criteria for different diarthrodial joints components will be examined. The second subgroup is the study of the global behaviour of different healthy versus unhealthy joints. Numerical modelling will be conducted via finite element analysis software. The geometry will be imported using digital image analysis software that are capable of transferring stacks of two dimensional images into three dimensional objects. The role of the different components in load transmission across healthy versus symptomatic joints will be investigated. The location and magnitude of the contact pressure between articulating surfaces will be analyzed. The dependence of the results on the ranges of material properties available in the literature will be studied to understand the repeatability of the results. The mechanics governing the load transmission and the health and stability of such joints will be evaluated. The long term objective of the project is to be able to reach to a level where computational mechanics can be effectively used to aid the diagnosis and repair recommendations for patient specific cases.","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Mechanical Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta
"Skeletal muscle is an important tissue in all animals, because of its significant roles in substrate utilization and body homeostasis. Proteins are critical components of muscle (about 65% of muscle weight is protein). Therefore to control muscle growth one has to control protein metabolism in this tissue. However, we do not know the mechanisms by which food regulates protein metabolism in muscle. An understanding of these mechanisms will help to better appreciate how metabolism and growth of an animal are regulated. My research will shed more light on this. An important player in protein synthesis in muscle is a protein called S6K1. Using nutritional manipulation, muscle and cell incubation, I seek to identify how S6K1 regulates protein synthesis when amino acids, an important class of nutrients in muscle, are supplied. I will also examine how this regulation is modified in insulin resistant states. The fundamental understanding gained in this research will help to better understand how nutrients regulate metabolism and growth. Our results may also help future studies examining questions relating to nutrition and human conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome .

"The soil provides an anchoring matrix for plant roots, as well as nutrients for growth and water holding capacity. As all living organisms die, they are decomposed into organic matter, soluble nutrients and carbon dioxide by species in the soil. The organic matter contributes to soil physical and chemical properties, as well as a source of substrate for increasing decomposition into soluble plant-available nutrients. The carbon dioxide respired by soil organisms is needed by plants for photosynthesis. Therefore an understanding of soil contribution to plant growth, such as in agriculture or forestry , requires an understanding of the soil ecology that provides the plants with their nutrients. This study contributes to our understanding of how plant and soil communities change over decades, and how they may affect each other. To do this we describe communities in a series of mine sites and other sites left to succession over decades, into young forests. This study will also measure specific interactions within experimental food webs, to obtain amounts of nutrient transfer among components of the decomposition food web. The measurements will help to obtain better predictive models for decomposition of organic matter through soil food webs, with application to soil nutrient management. This study will also contribute to our understanding of soil quality bioindicators species, such as testate amoebae. Through modern DNA-chip technology, we will develop further a protocol for rapid molecular identification of species in the soil, that will facilitate description of soil communities.","Foresterie (sylviculture, am�nagement forestier)","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","Evolution & Ecology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Nova Scotia","Nouvelle-�cosse"

"Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) uses a set of electrodes placed around the patient's body to apply current simulation and measure the resulting potentials, from which an image of the internal conductivity distribution is calculated. EIT is sensitive to physiological phenomena which affect the conductivity - it has been used to image the brain (to view perfusion changes due to epilepsy and stroke), the breast (to screen for cancerous regions), the abdomen (for gastric emptying) and thorax (to image the movement of blood and gas in the heart and lungs). My research focuses on thoracic applications, where EIT shows excellent promise as a tool to monitor the pattern of air and blood flow in infant and adult intensive care applications. These patients have lungs which are both inhomogeneous (needing an imaging technology to map the distribution of air and blood flow), and unstable (needing a monitoring technology to watch the patient's progress). The most important limitation to EIT is due to the electrodes, which move with breathing and posture changes. This research program will focus on addressing the electrode movement uncertainties to improve EIT for cardio-pulmonary imaging for patient monitoring in intensive care. Two avenues of research will be undertaken: 1) image reconstruction algorithms focusing on 3D image reconstruction using helper data from impedance plethysmography (IP) to correct for movement artefacts; and 2) Clinical and experimental validation in order to measure the accuracy of EIT, and to identify specific challenges for the algorithms. A successful outcome of this research will develop 1) novel equipment based on fusing data from EIT and IP sensors, 2) advanced image reconstruction algorithms to simultaneously image 3D electrode movements and conductivity distributions, and 3) clinical and experimental validations of these algorithms and equipment to clarify the accuracy and clinical potential of the technology.

"This proposal aims to develop a new class of photovoltaic devices (solar cells) that utilize advanced nano-scale materials for efficient charge generation and conduction. The main focus of the project is the preparation of carbon nanotube complexes with conjugated polymers that can be electrophoretically deposited on transparent electrodes in a manner similar to electroplating of metals. Carbon nanotubes are molecular structures that are entirely composed of carbon and exhibit unique conductivity, strength, and stability properties. It has already been found that light-induced electron injection from conjugated molecules adsorbed to the nanotube surface is an efficient process, laying the foundation for the development of photovoltaic devices. By varying the structure of the conjugated polymer, we will be able to tune its absorption properties to perfectly match the solar irradiation spectrum at the Earth's surface, while maintaining a high photoinduced electron transfer efficiency. The use of electrophoretic deposition to fabricate the devices provides a powerful method that allows precise control over film thickness, homogeneity, and composition. We will introduce multiple polymers, absorbing at different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, to not only harvest a maximum amount of light, but also to introduce energy transfer processes that will allow a reduction in the required nanotube quantity, while enhancing the efficiency of photon-to-electron conversion. This strategy closely mimics the natural photosynthetic processes that occur in plants and photosynthetic bacteria, capitalizing on the concepts that Nature has evolved over millions of years. The resulting devices will represent a new platform for solar energy conversion, and will have a strong potential to enable the preparation of large-scale photovoltaic stations that will supply vast amounts of clean, carbon-free electricity.","Ressources d'�nergie (production, exploration, traitement, distribution et utilisation de l'�nergie)","Ressources d'�nergie","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario
"This project will involve the fundamental investigation of polymer chemistry on the surface of a new class of materials called carbon nanotubes.  These new materials are entirely composed of carbon, exhibit extremely high mechanical strength (five times stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight), and can behave as either metallic conductors or semiconductors, depending on the way their carbon atoms are arranged.  However, as produced nanotubes are completely insoluble, making it difficult to manipulate and mix them with other materials (i.e., polymers) to make functional composites.  The aim of this proposal is to investigate hybrid structures where carbon nanotubes are linked to well-defined polymers capable of imparting solubility, processability, and function to the overall material.  This work will involve the formation of covalent bonds as well as non-covalent (supramolecular) interactions of polymers with carbon nanotubes.  Both methods of functionalization are important because, while the former allows strong bonds to be formed between the components, the latter prevents the introduction of defects within the nanotube structure, allowing preservation of nanotube conductivity and strength properties.  We will exploit several of our recently developed methods for nanotube functionalization to produce hybrid materials capable of forming larger complexes with other nano-scale structures (quantum dots) as well as homogeneous blends with conjugated polymers.  The eventual goal of this work will be to incorporate nanotubes within functional components of sensory, electron transfer, and light emitting devices.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Rising expectations of the quality and reach of wireless communications motivate the search for more efficient means to provide high data rate, multimedia, services over large areas and simultaneously to a large number of users over heterogeneous networks. The current (on-going) project supported by Bell University Laboratories focuses on the physical layer of fourth-generation cellular networks. It is widely expected that this physical layer will incorporate two technologies that are receiving significant research attention: multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) systems with antenna arrays at each end of the communication link and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing/multiple access (OFDM/OFDMA). To maximize usage of limited physical resources such as bandwidth and power, the project develops optimal and practical, near-optimal, resource allocation strategies and algorithms to communicate with multiple users simultaneously. 



This proposal complements this on-going project, dealing with the development of OFDM/OFDMA-based cooperative mesh networks. Cooperation helps to extend the advantages of MIMO systems to distributed networks comprising nodes with only a single antenna each. However, cooperation opens up a whole new set of problems that must be addressed before practical implementation is possible. Some of the questions that we will address are: how does cooperation happen? How many nodes and which nodes should cooperate with each other? How does channel information help communication? How do we optimally allocate power and bandwidth resources, including OFDM subcarriers, across nodes that are geographically distributed but are cooperating with each other? Mesh networks require multihop communications - how do we incorporate practical cooperation strategies in multiple hops? What is the impact of practical system design constraints on multihop networks? Practical system designs would focus on increasing data rate for a given reliability constraint -does cooperation always help increase data rate?

"A major concern of the applicant's research program in the recent years has been the development of a realistic structural and dynamic model of a modern helicopter rotor blade that can be used to simulate various dynamic behaviours of these blades with a high degree of fidelity. A main use of such a model is in the investigation of Blade Sailing Phenomenon (BSP) in shipboard helicopters. During start-up and shut-down operations of helicopter rotor blades on ship decks, due to low speeds of the rotor the blades can be subjected to high wind-induced aerodynamic forces without the benefit of the centrifugal stiffening present at the higher normal operating speeds. This excitation combined with ship deck motion and wind conditions has the potential of resulting in excessive deformations in rotor blades that is referred to as BSP. As the result, the rotor blades can come into contact with the fuselage or tailboom of the helicopter resulting in substantial levels of airframe damage with the possibility of bringing the airworthiness of the vehicle into question, as well as compromising the safety of flight crew and the ship deck personnel quite seriously. Using the principles of rigid multibody dynamics a system model that can simulate the dynamic interaction of the helicopter, the ship motion and aerodynamics will be developed. This model will be used primarily to investigate the nature of BSP in order to understand the interaction of the various components contributing to this phenomenon. A second continuous beam model that is based on variational asymptotic method will be used to model the structural characteristics of the elastic blade. Mixed variational formulation that is based on exact intrinsic dynamic equations will be used to model the dynamic behaviour of rotating blades in this model. This second model that also incorporates integrated piezoelectric fibres as Active Fibre Composites (AFC) will be used to investigate how the sailing phenomenon can be controlled by using the piezoelectric actuators to influence the operation of the blades and their dynamic performance. Using genetic algorithms a novel approach is suggested for optimizing the configuration and placement of the necessary AFC in the blade.

"The oceans and atmosphere have general circulation, and yet are rich with flow fields and density fields of much smaller scale. My overall research objective is to better understand the dynamical processes that govern the behavior of the stratified and rotating fluids that comprise the Earth's oceans. This study will enhance our capability to predict the evolution of complex nonlinear fluid dynamical systems. During the next grant period I propose to continue this work in order to deepen our understanding of large and small-scale vortical phenomena in oceanic flows.The main objective of this proposal is to investigate circulations on a polar beta-plane which models the quadratic variation of the Coriolis parameter in the polar ocean or atmosphere. The particular focus is on the production of jet-like currents, vortices and Rossby waves. The approach includes theory, numerical simulations and laboratory experiments. In the laboratory we use a new method of remotely measuring pressure, velocity and vorticity in a rotating fluid. We call this new technique 'Altimetric Image Velocimetry', as it uses the parabolic fluid surface as a Newtonian telescope to detect small scale perturbations of the surface. This method can provide high resolution velocity field such that laboratory experiments equal or exceed current 3D numerical models in detailed rendering of the flow. The outcome of the research using this method will be of great interest for communities involved in addressing 'spontaneous imbalance' or 'jets and annular structures in geophysical fluid dynamics ' who are working to include non-geostrophic dynamics in what traditionally have been quasi-geostrophic idealizations of ocean and atmosphere. This method is new and can provide the cutting edge research here in Canada.

"The combination of quantum mechanics and a macroscopic number of interacting particles produces some of the most challenging unsolved problems in all of science. When the particles are electrons in a solid, their collective quantum mechanical interactions can lead to important macroscopic behaviour like magnetism and superconductivity.  Over the last century standard approximations have  been developed for understanding such systems at least roughly. These generally correspond to types of ""mean field theories"" in which the interacting system is approximated by a non-interacting one. These approximations generally cannot be justified from first principles but often seem to work. As experimental condensed matter physics advances into new domains, increasing numbers of systems are being discovered which don't submit to these standard approximations.  They are often referred to as ""strongly correlated"". In many cases the strong correlations are directly connected to ""reduced dimensionality"": the particles are moving primarily on planes, or lines or are confined to very small regions. Such reduced dimensionality is known to generally enhance quantum effects.  This proposal is to study theoretically several important examples of such strongly correlated systems including high Tc superconductors, low dimensional quantum magnets, semi-conductor quantum dots, ultra-cold atoms in cylindrical traps and superfluid helium in narrow pores. High-Tc superconductors have applications to power transmission and storage. Quantum dots are candidates for qubits in quantum computers. It turns out that while the low dimensionality enhances quantum fluctuations, rendering inapplicable standard mean field theories,  it also allows new theoretical methods to be brought to bear including quantum field theory methods (often borrowed from sub-atomic theory), large scale numerical simulations and, in some fortunate cases, exact solubility based on the existence of infinite numbers of conservation laws. I intend to apply such methods, some of which I have developed myself, to these problems. This research programme would provide training to a large number of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in these advanced techniques.

"In recent years, the most active area in networking is wireless sensor networks. Industrial and governmental interests are linked to applications such as military, health-care, monitoring of natural disaster, hazardous materials in chemical plants. These networks are beginning to combine real-time applications such as voice and video, which have a limited tolerance for network latency, with non-real time data traffic. In addition to satisfying numerous Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, these low cost, large scale wireless sensor networks with potentially thousand of nodes require a high degree of reliability and security. 

    )	In WSNs, sensor node or a communication link failure is inevitable and cannot be avoided. Traditionally, replication or redundancy of these nodes and links, and providing multiple paths, is used to recover from these failures, which increases network bandwidth requirements and energy consumption on the network, and switching to pre-established alternate paths increases recovery delay. There is no solution that can provide link/node failure recovery with no delay and packet loss with reasonable network resources. 

WSNs are prone to security threats due to the nature of its applications and easy accessibility of sensor nodes. Existing network security mechanisms, including those developed for ad-hoc networks, involve a large amount of computational and resource overhead, and cannot be applied directly to resource-constraint sensor networks. Integrating security measures in every component makes individual sensor nodes complicated. It is therefore required to build sensor networks with simple security measures involving less computation on the part of relay nodes.

    )	The major objective of this research activity is to develop protocols that will provide fault-tolerance and security in WSNs to satisfy the dependability requirements of both real-time unicast and multicast applications. Extensive simulations will support the work. End-to-end requirements for dependability over multiple domains will also be considered.","Technologie de l'information, des ordinateurs et des r�seaux de communications","Avancement des connaissances","Electrical and Computer Engineering",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Multidimensional systems are used to process signals which have more than one independent variable.  They have applications in space-time processing, image and video processing.  The proposed research focuses on the following problems:



1. Beamforming and Direction of Arrival Estimation:  Algorithms for Direction of Arrival (DOA) Estimation will be developed for broadband applications such as ultra wideband communications or speech detection using sensor arrays.  The approach will be based on using subarray beamforming which estimates the DOA from the phase difference between a reference signal and its phase shifted version.  The proposed approach is expected to lead to a computationally simple DOA estimation technique for broadband signals.



2. Multidimensional Filter Design and Implementation: Design techniques and implementation efficiency with respect to computations and roundoff errors for multidimensional (2-D and 3-D) filters will be studied and evaluated. The possible application areas to be considered are filtering of broadband signals propagated by plane waves and filters for video standards conversion.

"Changes in ""gene activity"" (gene expression) that affect the way cells function can be seen as changes in the amount and/or activity of proteins that the genes code for. Cells use some proteins for structure, storage or binding, and some proteins (enzymes) for carrying out biochemical reactions (enzyme activities). The amount of protein/ enzyme activity in the cell reflects the expression status of its gene in the cell. A biochemical test detects changes in the characteristics of the test liquid relative to the amount or activity of proteins/ enzymes in the sample being tested. A microplate reader is used for this purpose. The microplate allows many tests to be done at the same time, and the microplate reader measures the changes in characteristics in the test liquid. Today tests are available for many proteins and enzymes. Older versions of the reader can measure changes in characteristics of the test liquid based on absorption of visible and UV light; modern versions can detect changes in more characteristics (e.g., based on luminescence or fluorescence) in minute amounts of test liquids. Some of the methods used to understand how gene expression is regulated take advantage of the fact that purified DNA (what genes are made of) can be manipulated and reintroduced into cells. A new method has been worked out for efficient introduction of DNA into cells, especially ""primary cells"" (which are more like the cells in the body, unlike the cancer cells that are widely used by many laboratories today). We are proposing a resource that dramatically improves the efficiency of the way we put genes back into cells AND analyze how the genes respond to specific metabolic states or how they influence the metabolic function of the recipient cells, which helps us to understand better how gene activity is controlled and what genes do in cells. The resource is made up of two instruments: one allows efficient transfer of DNA into cells (especially primary cells), the other allows versatile and sensitive measurements of the activities coded for by genes. This resource will significantly enhance and extend the capabilities of 6 laboratories that have independent and collaborative research programs as well as train individuals who will become tomorrow's professionals.","Sant� publique (y compris recherche psychologique li�e � la m�decine)","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Biological Systems and Functions",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are abundant, small molecular weight soluble proteins found in a wide variety of tissues. Certain species of FABPs are associated with certain tissue types. These proteins share similar 3D structures despite significant dissimilarity in their primary structures. The divergence in primary structure likely contributes to their preference of ligands. The physiological function of these proteins is not precisely known. It is suggested that these proteins play an important role in the cellular transport and storage of their respective ligands, which are small hydrophobic compounds. Studies using targeted gene technology in mice suggest that the loss of these proteins affects the metabolism of their respective ligands. It has also been suggested that FABPs may be involved in regulation of gene expression, by serving as the intracellular shuttle between the membrane-bound transporter that internalizes the ligand and the cognate nuclear receptor that is bound to the promoters of target genes. The ileal lipid binding protein (ilbp) was initially localized in the distal portion of the small intestine. Ilbp can bind both fatty acids and bile acids. Bile acids are amphipathic molecules synthesized by the liver from cholesterol, and are essential for the solubilization and absorption of lipids and lipid-soluble nutrients. Some investigators have suggested that ilbp plays a major role in bile acid transport and metabolism, due to the greater affinity of ilbp for bile acids. Recently however, ilbp has also been detected in the ovaries, raising the possibility that this protein may have a physiological function beyond bile acid metabolism. The proposed research program is constructed around three themes. Under Theme I, we will explore the physiological function of ILBP in the metabolism of bile acids using mice as a model system of study. Under Theme II, we will analyze the role of ilbp in non-intestinal cells, such as ovary cells. Under Theme III, we will probe the molecular determinants of ilbp ligand binding. The proposed research is anticipated to give new insights on ilbp biology as well as advance our general understanding of FABP action.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Integrative Animal Biology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Future civilian and military rescue missions will rely on large, networked groups of small vehicles and sensors operating in dynamic, resource-constrained, adversarial environments. Groups of this type will typically operate with little or no direct human supervision and will be very difficult, if not impossible, to efficiently manage or control by programming or by tele-operation. Management of such large groups will thus be extremely challenging and will require integration of communication, control, computation and sensing, specifically tailored to the command and control of large-scale, autonomously functioning vehicle groups. To address these challenges, we propose to embark on a broadly-based, cross-disciplinary research program in which we will develop and study networked groups of autonomous agents. Our goal is to develop a minimum-time reconfiguration problem which is a matter of grave importance in rescue missions. It is also

desired to develop scalable, provably correct protocols for vision-based distributed coordination of networked group of autonomous agents and cooperative robots. One of the applications of the proposed research is in coordinated disaster relief operation after a natural catastrophe or terrorist attack, by providing a temporary communication network. Another civilian application is in mining industry, where a group of semi-autonomous mobile equipment in a mining environment work

collaboratively to achieve a desirable goal without compromising human safety.","G�nie","Avancement des connaissances","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Safety and Security",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"When control theory is applied to a system that consists of several interconnected components, it is often desired to have some form of decentralization. Problems of this kind appear, for example, in electric power systems, communication networks, large space structures, robotic systems, economic systems and traffic networks, to name only a few. More recently, decentralized control theory has found important applications in the cooperative control systems such as formation flying, underwater vehicles, automated highway, satellite constellation, etc. This relatively new line of research is of a great interest for Canadian Space Agency, NASA and European Space Agency in their present and future projects. A decentralized control structure reduces the computational complexity of the control and the communication requirements between the components of a cooperative control system. 



In this research, several important aspects of decentralized control systems such as control structure (in terms of information flow between the local controllers), the effect of time-delay in the interconnections and the input, robust stability and robust performance in presence of disturbance and uncertainty in the system model will be considered, with a special focus on cooperative control applications. The proposed research is the continuation of my previous NSERC application, whose results went beyond the objectives of the application to address some of the suggestions made by the reviewers, and also to investigate important interdisciplinary problems using control theoretic approaches.

"    )	This program of research is founded on the training of graduate and undergraduate students in designing new tools and methods to address questions pertaining to environmental-population health issues.  Their efforts have lead to the development of a particle levitation platform that we apply toward particulate air pollution.  

    )	The levitation platform will be used in the context of a particle source.  Particles formed in the levitation device have known size and composition.  The multi-component particles, designed to mimic the size and composition of an ambient particle type, are then delivered to human lung cells, in vitro.  The methodology for this particle creation and delivery has been developed, and we are thus focusing our efforts on particle speciation and how that effects varied lung cell responses. A goal of this work is to generate results that provide answers to long standing questions surrounding why particles suspended in the troposphere cause adverse effects on human health; what is more important, particle size or composition?

    )	The students working on this project are challenged to develop sought-for sample preparation skills, handling ultra-small quantities of materials, cell culturing techniques, bioanalytical methods, and the use and development of modern instrumental techniques all while successfully communicating with other students and investigators having backgrounds that span chemistry, atmospheric sciences, lung cell biology, and internal medicine. 

    )	Anticipated outcomes of this research include identification of; particle types, and compounds that cause most significant responses from lung cells with the subsequent objective that the introduction of such species into the atmosphere be restricted to improve air quality; mediators that cells use to communicate will also be identified and those compounds may find use as biomarkers in early diagnosis of inflammation.  Other outcomes include advances in micrometer and nanometer particle design, advances in analytical tools and methods, and highly qualified personnel.

"The ubiquity of sex and recombination across disparate forms of biological life indicate that the selective pressures favouring genetic exchange are powerful and widespread. Understanding this source of selection is not only important to basic science but may allow for improved management of biological resources (i.e., agriculture, fisheries, forestry, conservation).  However, the ultimate reasons for sex and recombination have been elusive.  Although there has been considerable progress in understanding the conceptual issues underlying this classic problem, many theoretical and empirical questions remain.  The proposed research outlines several projects designed to illuminate the importance of different factors affecting the evolution of sex.  Specifically, theory will be developed to evaluate how different sources of genetic variation (e.g., deleterious mutation, spatial heterogeneity in selection, host-parasite coevolution) contribute to selection for sex.  Empirically, we will test how sex and recombination affect the mean and variance in fitness under different experimental conditions.

 Because, the genetic shuffling caused by sex only matters when genes are variable, it is necessary to understand the sources of genetic variance in fitness.  One major source is deleterious mutation.  The constant influx of deleterious mutations reduces the health of individuals, lowers the productivity of populations, and hampers adaptation.  Consequently, deleterious mutations are relevant to many aspects of evolutionary biology as well as to public health, conservation, and the management of fisheries and forestry. We will test how environmental stress and genetic background affects selection against new mutations.  We will also evaluate the role of sexual selection in eliminating deleterious alleles.

"The development of intelligent machines that can mimic biological locomotion or enhance human mobility, or biorobotics in general, is undergoing a rapid growth as the underlying mechatronic technologies are evolving. However, these machines are far less optimal than biological systems in terms of their stability, robustness, intelligence, and energy efficiency. This research, inspired by biological systems, aims at optimizing the performance of legged robots through optimal motion planning, intelligent learning controllers and exploiting passive dynamic motions of mechanical systems. Bipedal locomotion, due to its significance to biomedical and human kinetic sciences, has been selected as the main focus. Energy-efficient and stable gaits will be obtained from bipedal walking, through off-line an off-line multi-criteria optimization process or through modulating simple dynamics. A new learning control strategy will be devised that will be applicable to biped locomotion on uneven terrains and postural stability on moving grounds such as ship boards. This research also aims at using the passive dynamic principles to develop new classes of efficient bipeds and wearable devices with intelligent controllers that can be used as walking aids. A single-degree-of-freedom compliant assistive device for knee joint will be realized to investigate intelligent learning controllers and improvements in energetics. The EMG (Electromyogram) signals and user interaction forces are used in a feedback controller to determine the required torques to augment the knee power in a safe fashion for different users. Collaborations with Ottawa Hospital's Rehabilitation Centre will ensure the applicability of the results which can improve the quality of life of many Canadians with walking difficulties.","G�nie","Avancement des connaissances","Mechanical Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"We are entering in a new era in particle physics as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will become operational in 2008.  This is the most powerfull particle accelerator that has been constructed so far and has enormous discovery potentials.  Protons are accelerated in this machine to close to the speed of light, made colliding with each other inside the detectors.  The product of these very high energy collision are a large number of elementary particles that are heavy enough that require large energies to be produced.  The hope is, through analyzing these particles we can trace some new particles that we have not seen before.  This is the direct way of new particle discovery.  My research proposal is about indirect methods of detecting new particles.  As mentioned above, we can LHC is expected to produce a large number of heavy quarks known as b quarks.  Therefore, we are able to observe even very rare decays of these quarks which have a small likelihood to happen.  These rare decays are sometimes quite susceptible to the interference from much heavier particles that may be out there but have not been discovered yet.  My proposed investigation is to have a better understanding of these interferences which can then be compared against the experimental data from LHC.  This comparison will hopefully give us some clues on what is acceptable and what is not acceptable for unknown heavy particles.  It is much easier to directly discover something when we know roughly where to look for it.

"There is a growing demand for efficient techniques for next generation wireless systems. Hence, it is timely to address new technologies that can revolutionize wireless communication systems in terms of transmission rates and quality of service. Cooperative diversity is a very promising technology which is expected to be one of the underlying technologies for future wireless systems. The main concept of cooperative diversity is that intermediate nodes between the source and destination nodes can forward the source signal to obtain multiple copies of the same signal at the destination. Combining these multiple copies can bring many benefits such as better signal quality, improved coverage and higher capacity. However, cooperative diversity also brings some challenges and complexities. The main issues to be addressed in this program of research are the following:



1) Novel cooperation and relaying techniques 

2) Cross-layer resource allocation algorithms for cooperative-diversity networks

3) Synchronization and channel estimation in cooperative-diversity networks

4) Incorporating cooperative diversity in existing and emerging wireless systems

5) Developing policies and incentives to encourage users cooperation



The study will start with defining a framework for cooperative-diversity networks. Next, the main challenges will be identified. Novel techniques and algorithm will then be proposed. Then, the proposed algorithms will be analyzed using computer simulation, analytical methods and experimental work. Results from this research are crucial for gaining deeper insight into the cooperative-diversity concept. Also, the results can be utilized to facilitate its adoption in existing and future wireless systems. In addition, this research will enable the training of several graduate and undergraduate students.

"It is a truism that the Internet has become integral to nearly all aspects of modern life, from science to  entertainment, from government to industry, from the economy to our culture.  But while the open architecture  of the Internet has been the chief enabler of it's explosive growth, this same openness, combined with the  abundance of insecure commercial software installed in end-hosts, has provided attackers with a nearly  inexhaustible supply of vulnerable hosts to exploit, either as primary victims or as intermediate steps in a chain of exploits.  These threats comprimise the safety and integrity of commerce and activity on the Internet.   



We propose here research into techniques and tools for enterprises to better secure their networks, hosts, and data resources.  Two themes recur throughout this research.  The first is an emphasis on the anomaly detection approach rather than the misuse detection approach.  In the later, models are made of illegitimate traffic and alarms are raised when traffic or  behaviour matches a model.  In the former, a model is made of legitimate traffic and an alarm is raised when traffic or behaviour deviates from the model.  The majority of security tools rely on misuse detection as there is a wide-spread belief that the behaviour of computing systems are too complex to model for use in anomaly detection.  Two of the projects described in this proposal involve modelling complex domains.  The second  theme is an emphasis on measuring and improving the tradeoff between security and usability/availability.","T�l�informatique","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computing and Information Sciences - A",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Web personalization is an Internet technique for adapting websites to individuals. In general, it is based on the user profile, which summarizes what the website knows about the individual user. Unfortunately, this information is too often obtained without the user's knowledge or consent. In this research, I focus on a special class of web personalization technique, known as recommender systems, which have been used primarily in the context of electronic commerce. Recommender systems have also been used in the context of e-learning in order to help students choose programs and courses.

Recommender systems are very useful, but they typically come at a price: in order to operate, it would seem that they need to collect information on those who use them. It follows that most current recommender systems suffer from various privacy-protection vulnerabilities. In the case of electronic commerce, customers who wish to obtain accurate recommendations are often asked to reveal information that they may consider private. The potential abuses from unscrupulous merchants could result in a serious erosion of the customer's privacy, who should be able to keep private their personal information and not be tracked against their will.

In current e-learning systems: privacy concerns are nearly absent. Only primitive forms of privacy are offered in some platforms, such as not allowing the tutor any access to information about auto-evaluations performed by the learners. Nonetheless, the tutor has access to virtually all the remaining information including who are the students, what parts of the course they referred to, how many times and for how long, and all the information about the quizzes and tests the learner took in his course.

The main focus of the proposed research is to develop recommender systems capable of offering the electronic services that we have come to take for granted, but in ways that prevent the creation of user profiles that could be abused. The tutoring process itself, not only its recommendation, will also be studied from a privacy point of view. I shall use my dual expertise in electronic commerce and e-learning to cross-fertilize the two fields.

"This three year strategic project is concerned with the development of a series of new integrated waveguide devices for ultrafast all-optical signal processing applications. The proposed theoretical and experimental research will allow university teams from University of Toronto and INRS-EMT, in collaboration with their industrial partner, to lead Canadian and international efforts in searching for low-cost, high-performance, fully customized optical pulsed sources. Our studies are directed toward the generation of train of ultrafast optical pulses WITH ARBITRARILY CUSTOMIZED SHAPES, a problem of fundamental importance to several present and future applications, using integrated waveguide platforms. In particular, we plan to develop a series of novel and simple integrated waveguide designs that will overcoming the limitations of the classical free-space-based approach (limited integrated capabilities). Pulse shapers' designs to be investigated in our Project include: (A) Integrated waveguide Bragg gratings implemented using a new technological approach that offers an unprecedented degree of control for arbitrarily customizing the grating profiles; (B) Concatenated two-arm interferometers, based on (B.1) an integrated waveguide platform enabling programmable pulse re-shaping operations via thermally-tunable delay lines, and (B.2) an extremely compact and efficient photonic crystal waveguides geometry. Short-term research effort will be directed to the modeling, simulation and design of the proposed integrated pulse shaping devices, followed by fabrication and experimental testing and analysis of the developed devices. The targeted designs will be implemented in semiconductor (III-V) integrated technologies, thus preparing the ground for the monolithic integration of the developed pulse shapers with semiconductor laser diodes. The resulting, compact sources could have a dramatic impact in several disciplines, such as telecommunication engineering, optical computing and biomedical imaging. The new knowledge generated from this project and the training of highly qualified personnel associated to the different stages of this work will contribute to enhance Canada's global competitiveness in high-technology sectors.","Technologie des t�l�communications (satellites, radar,etc.)","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information B",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario
"Mid infrared gas detection has become increasingly important in areas such as environmental monitoring, clinical analysis, life sciences, security and the food industry. However at present there are no compact, room temperature and tunable sources readily available for the 2 - 5 micron part of the spectrum. Current approaches based on quantum cascade lasers and lead salt lasers offer limited tunability or require cooling.



In this application we present a proposal for realizing an on-chip, electrically pumped, tunable mid IR source. The source will consist of an integrated optical parametric oscillator monolithically integrated with a semiconductor pump laser. 



The project will be carried out in collaboration with the University of Glasgow. Researchers at the University of Glasgow have pioneered the ability to monolithically integrate active and passive components on to a single chip.

"The long-term goals of my research program include understanding the regulation of the pathways of cysteine and methionine biosynthesis and the basis of substrate and reaction specificity in the enzymes of the transsulfuration pathways, which catalyze the inter-conversion of these two sulfur-containing amino acids. This research encompasses three inter-related projects with biotechnological, agricultural and environmental applications. (1) During the next granting cycle, my students and I will continue to investigate the structurally-similar, but mechanistically-distinct enzymes of the transsulfuration pathways. The identification of determinants of reaction specificity in these enzymes, resulting from this work, will contribute to our understanding of how pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes control the chemistry of this catalytically-versatile cofactor, thereby facilitating the design of customized biocatalysts for the production of novel amino acid compounds. (2) Grain legumes are important Canadian export crops and staple foods in many countries. However, they are deficient in the essential amino acid methionine, from the perspective of human nutrition. My lab is exploring the mechanisms that regulate the flow of metabolites in the methionine biosynthetic pathway of chickpea. The results of this work will enable the subtle genetic engineering of grain legumes required to improve their nutritional quality. (3) The amino acids cysteine and methionine are the precursors of compounds, such as glutathione, phytochelatins and nicotianamine, which can coordinate heavy metal ions and are involved in their translocation and sequestration in plants. The conservative estimate of 30,000 contaminated sites in Canada demonstrates the urgent need for developing low-cost remediation technologies.

"State and parameter estimation is fundamental to control and modeling in many disciplines. Parameter estimation is needed to implement system models that, together with estimates of the current state, are used to formulate intelligent decisions based on sensor information, to compute feedback control signals, to adapt the model or control algorithms and/or parameters, and to build a representation of the operational environment. Classical approaches to state and parameter estimation, such as Kalman or related Bayesian methods, are largely based on linear Gaussian assumptions under which it is sufficient to estimate the mean and covariance of prior and posterior density distributions of the estimates. More recently, new methods have been developed for nonlinear systems based on sequential Monte Carlo particle filtering and its many variants. Particle filters carry more complete information using a point mass representation of probability distributions rather than just the mean and covariance. Our recent research has evaluated particle filtering methods for nonlinear applications and has contributed new techniques to improve performance and robustness of the methods and also to introduce evidential reasoning for representation and accumulation of knowledge based on the Dempter-Shafer theory of evidence. Resources requested under this proposal will fund graduate student research to develop, implement, and test new methods for evidential reasoning in particle filtering for parameter and state estimation. In our research, we will target applications in vehicular robotics, but the results are expected to be applicable to many diverse applications.

"Today's digital circuits may contain up to several hundred million transistors. It is recognized that functional verification remains a major bottleneck of the design process, accouting for 70% of its overall costs. Functional verification by simulation is a way of finding bugs by deriving functional tests (testbench drivers) while attempting to reach functional coverage goals for the design. Finding corner-case bugs with simulation is often inefficient due to the limited controllability of the design through the testbench drivers.  Writing a directed test to exercise a specific behavior can be challenging and time-consuming. Waiting for a constrained-random simulation to exercise the same behavior can also take a long time, with no guarantee that corner cases are really being exercised. In contrast, a formal verification tool can be very successful for finding difficult bugs. However, these tools are complex, they need huge resources (CPU time and memory), and they usually need specialized experts which limit their integration in the design flow. Recently, new formal and simulation based techniques has been developped to enhance the functional verification process. However, the rapid inreases in the design complexity makes it difficult to get rid of the presilicon bugs which have consistently increased for each new design generation. One way, to combat this verification bottlenck is to combine multiple, complementary techniques so that their combined strength is superior to the sum of the individual technques. In this research program, we address the development of hybrid verification tools and techniques to achieve the higher verification coverage of real-size microelectronics designs in a practical way. We believe that our approach will advance the state-of-the-art in systems verification, thus enhancing the shortening the design cycle. The direct beneficiary of this research will be the Canadian microelectronics industry. Furthermore, this proposal will contribute towards the training of a number of skilled personnel available to Canadian industry and academy.

"Software evolution is a change process that covers all the life cycle of a software product. Of all the software processes, evolution is the most expensive. Models are critical in documenting software architectures, and making them easy to understand. A complex software system evolves over time and its architecture will change as the system meets the challenges of its environment. Therefore, models and meta-models play a key role in software evolution.  Empirical research shows that it is very difficult to completely predict software changes. More time and money are spent maintaining (changing) a software system than on its original development.  According to the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM) working group on software evolution ""The only way to overcome or avoid the negative effects of software aging is by placing change in the center of the software development process."" There is therefore a need to provide better and more automated support for software evolution

      My approach consists of the following: design and implement a constraint with action language for model evolution. This is done by extending the object constraint language (OCL) to include actions, operations, and a new data type. The new data type is based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with annotation (ADAG). The ADAG uses the dependency relation weight and an optimized labeling scheme to provide tools for automation and optimization of model evolution. This approach is simple but powerful enough to be used efficiently for typical software evolution management operations like impact analysis, correction, improvement and enhancement of design models.

      The potential industrial value of a well-defined framework for software model evolution is big because modern software systems, most of them distributed and embedded, are very complex and time consuming systems that require efficient tools for their development and evolution.

"FTIR SPECTROMETER FOR ORIENTATION AND STRUCTURE MEASUREMENTS IN FILMS AND FIBERS



Polymer films and fibers represent a large segment of the plastics industry. Their performance is the result of the microstructure that is imparted to the material as a result of complex interactions between the resin and the thermo-mechanical history that it experiences during processing. Hence, the determination of the structural characteristics of those films and fibers such as orientation of crystalline and amorphous phases, crystalline structure, composition of multilayer films etc. will be crucial for the development of performing materials.

Various techniques can be used for the determination of orientation and structural characteristics of polymers; however, FTIR spectroscopy is the simplest and most cost effective and versatile. The configuration needed includes various accessories for polarization of the incident radiation for orientation measurements, a reflection measurement accessory (ATR) for the case of fibers, rough surfaces, highly absorbing polymers or thick samples.

This equipment is necessary to conduct my research programs because of the planned significant use by about 10 graduate students, 4 post doctoral fellows and at least two research associates under my supervision or co-supervision. This equipment will be utilised at least 60-70% of the time by my research group. The remaining time (probably about 1 day per week) will be available for other potential users. Finally, all the graduate students and post doctoral fellows who are and will be working on my research programs will use this equipment on a regular basis all along their studies or training.

"The microstructure of polymer films and fibers is strongly influenced by molecular parameters of the resin (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, branching, co-monomer type and content, etc.) as well as the rheological, thermodynamic, thermal properties and the crystallization kinetics under the processing conditions. On the other hand, in the past, many studies were directed to the improvement of structural properties of films and fibers (mainly mechanical: strength, tear, toughness etc...) and much less interest was directed to functionality of those films and fibers (barrier, porosity, conductivity, piezoelectricity, biological interactions, etc..). It is our purpose in this research program to address some of these functional properties, namely porosity, conductivity, piezoelectricity and biological interactions, in relation to films and fibers structures, using polymers and nanocomposites. Preliminary studies indicated promessing results for vascular and nerve scaffolds made for fiber structures and intersting porous structure and potential piezoelectric properties for films and fibers made from some polymers. It is to be noted here that, because of the multidisciplinary nature of the research proposed (involving biology in particular), most of it will be performed in collaboration with scientists in the appropriate disciplines

"Cool urban surfaces reduce urban heat islands, save cooling energy in air conditioned buildings, improve indoor and outdoors ambient air quality and comfort, and more importantly directly cool the globe and combat global warming. Measurements of solar reflectance, solar absorptance, solar transmittance, and thermal emittance are needed to design advanced buildings and construction materials. For design of advanced windows in air conditioned buildings, it is important to select materials that allow incoming visual light but reject the near infrared light. Similarly, building envelope materials (roof and walls) with high solar reflectance and high thermal emittance stay cool during hot summer days resulting in lower air conditioning demand. Building materials with advanced thermochromic materials have the benefit of reflecting sunlight in summer and absorbing it in winter. 

The proposed instrument, a UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer to measure the spectral properties of construction materials over the wavelength of 250-2500 nm (at 5 nm interval), is direct linked to my research program proposed for funding under the Discovery program. The main focus of the research program is to develop novel materials with optimal solar and thermal spectral properties and the UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer will be one of the principal instrumentation in the new ""Material Optical Properties Laboratory"" for research on spectral properties of construction materials at Concordia University. It is expected that the laboratory will be established this year and grow over the next few years to include not only the UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer but also a FTIR spectrometer to measure the optical properties of the materials in the range of 3000 to 40000 nm, a reflectometer to measure the overall solar reflectance, an emissometer to measure the thermal emissivity of construction materials, and several pyranometers for measuring the solar reflectance of surfaces in the field.

The requested UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer is the most important piece of equipment to start up the research activities and allow for a successful establishment of a new research field in Canada.

"Helicopters are required nowadays to possess high levels of agility and maneuverability and the capability to operate in degraded visual conditions over a wide range of airspeeds. Furthermore, for certification purposes, they need to satisfy some stringent reliability and performance requirements (the so-called handling qualities, HQ's) set out by the US Army's Aeronautical Design Standard ADS-33 (more precisely ADS-33E-PRF). From the control engineer point of view, designing helicopter flight control laws is a very challenging problem:  Helicopters present highly nonlinear and fully coupled dynamics that are inherently unstable. Existing mathematical models vary greatly from one flight region to the other and present severe uncertainties due to the empirical representation of aerodynamic forces and moments.  Still, for most rotorcraft flying today, the control laws have been developed using predominantly classical single-loop frequency response and root locus design techniques. These techniques are based on linearized models about a set of trim points within the flight envelope and provide only local stability. Moreover, the cost and time associated with refining the flight control law for each trim point and then �stitching them together� with gain schedules to cover the full flight is substantial and there is still much room for improvement in achieving consistent HQ's in the extreme portions of the flight envelope. This research proposes to develop a nonlinear autopilot which does not rely on small signal approximation nor on gain scheduling and is based on  recent results on nonlinear adaptive regulation. It is capable of achieving accurate tracking for vertical/lateral and longitudinal dynamics in the presence of severe uncertainties. More importantly, we propose to investigate means to integrate ADS-33-based requirements in the autopilot design. The  design will be validated on two platforms: a MIMO Twin Rotor system resembling a helicopter available in our laboratory and HELISIM, an industry standard flight simulator for helicopters developed by the Quebec-based company Engenuity Inc.

"Implantation requires a complex dialogue between an embryo competent to implant and an endometrium able to respond to it. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is the key hormone involved in such a dialogue. According to our recent data, this embryo's secreted hormone appears to directly induce secretion of major growth and angiogenic factors by endometrial cells, thereby promoting embryo implantation. More recent data from our laboratory revealed a new mechanism by which hCG modulates and rather boosts up endometrial cell receptivity to interleukin 1 (IL1), one of the earliest embryonic signal. Actually, hCG appears to alleviate cell surveillance of IL1 by markedly reducing the levels of its potent and specific inhibitor (the IL1 decoy receptor 2), without affecting IL1 receptor (the type 1) which mediates cell activation. This may have a considerable relevance for embryo implantation and development, considering the well-documented effects of IL1 in promoting cell survival, tissue remodeling and angiogenesis. The general and long-term objective of our research program is to elucidate the mechanisms of feto/maternal crosstalk during embryo implantation and pregnancy. At the short term, our objective is to elucidate the impact of hCG/IL1 interplay/synergism at the embryo-maternal interface by studying in vitro in cell culture and in vivo using mice models the inherent capability of hCG to regulate angiogenesis and cell survival, together with its indirect effects via the modulation of endometrial cell receptivity to IL1. This study may have a considerable interest for a better understanding of the mechanisms governing successful embryo implantation and development and ultimately for understanding of implantation failure-related infertility.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Integrative Animal Biology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The research will focus on the application of theta function and other infinite product identities to the explicit evaluation of convolution sums and the determination of formulae for the number of representations of positive integers by quadratic forms in 6 and 8 variables.



The classical theta functions provide a useful mathematical tool for determining the representability of integers by sums of squares. 



One aspect of the proposed research will focus on the determination of identities involving these theta functions. Of particular interest will be those identities which lead to definitive formulae for numbers of representations by classes of quadratic forms in a small even number of variables. 



Another aspect of the research will be to find identities involving infinite products closely related to theta functions and to apply them to the explicit evaluation of twisted convolution sums.

"In this application, we seek funding to continue our research program in information theory and wireless communications. The research program concerns the development of advanced joint source-channel coding (JSCC) technology for improving the reliability, connectivity and speed of wireless communication networks and meeting the rapidly growing demand  for seamless and ubiquitous wireless multimedia services. JSCC provides the  right approach to construct the best codes for the efficient transmission of data sources over noisy channels, particularly under stringent delay and complexity constraints and for multi-user networks where Shannon's principle for the separation of data compression and channel coding fails to hold in general. 



Building on our experience and extensive achievements in JSCC, we will focus on the following four research objectives: (i) the information theoretic investigation of the JSCC error exponent for multi-user networks; (ii) the development of sophisticated discrete channel models to judiciously represent the behavior of soft-decision demodulated correlated fading multi-antenna channels; (iii) the design and analysis of powerful low-complexity JSCC techniques for wireless networks; (iv) the application of the above JSCC methods to wireless multimedia communications and sensor networks.



This research project, which will feature the training of five graduate students (3 doctoral and 2 Masters) and one postdoctoral fellow per year, is anticipated to provide a deeper understanding of both the fundamental principles and the practical aspects of JSCC, thus positively contributing to a sustainable improvement of wireless communications and multimedia technologies.

"Investigating relevant turbulent processes at fundamental level is essential to understand geophysical flows in the atmosphere and oceans, and is critical for such varied purposes as weather forecasting, projecting climate change, and mitigating air pollution. Our current conceptual and technical tools are inadequate for explaining turbulence, and have yet to approach towards a comprehensive theory. Inadequate representation of interactions across multiple spatio-temporal scales in the atmosphere and oceans is one stumbling reason for poor performance of numerical models.

         Satellite observations in the atmosphere and oceans exhibit localized, filamentary structures with relevant scales that are much smaller than scales of global dynamics. Clearly, if we knew how to define and extract such localized structures, this would lead to a promising multi-scale numerical modelling approach. 

         Multi-scale approaches, such as wavelet methods, leads to compressing a signal. What compression of geophysical flows can be achieved optimally using wavelet based numerical models? Can we recover or predict unresolved scales of turbulence using the multi-resolution aspects of wavelets?  Note that ""recovering"" the unresolved motion is the appropriate alternate to classical parameterizing, if we can actually recover. Do we understand the nonlinear evolution of unresolved scales adequately?

         I, therefore, propose to study the following. i) Multi-scale wavelet methodology for geophysical turbulence. ii) A fully-Lagrangian modelling system  to investigate the nonlinear evolution of unresolved scales. iii) Reliability and scalability of numerical model's output after many time steps.

"The purchase of the proposed material test frame system will allow the determination of the mechanical properties of various advanced materials used in civil/mechanical/materials engineering under different loading conditions for instance, static, dynamic, and fatigue loading. Utilization of these novel materials will substantially improve the service life of various structures under extreme load events and will have a profound impact on the development of a sustainable solution to infrastructure longevity and its management. The specific engineering pursuits of interest to this research proposal relate to the following:

     1) Smart materials against extreme loads: Dr. Alam's research program focuses on the development of low-cost shape memory alloy based smart structures and its components with large recentering and high energy dissipation capacity. 2)Composites for construction: Dr. Rteil's research program deals with static and fatigue performance of advanced composite materials for instance, fibres reinforced polymer and textile reinforced mortar that possess high strength, light weight and good durability. 3) Integrity of ageing water and wastewater pipes in high seismic hazard regions: Dr. Tesfamariam's research entails characterization of the residual strength of different deteriorated pipes (PVC, cast iron, ductile iron, etc) and determination of failure mechanisms under different loading conditions. 4) Multi-objective design optimization of woven fabrics: Dr. Milani is involved in the numerical modeling, simulation, identification and optimization and testing of woven fabrics. 5) Mechanical behaviour of novel Magnesium-based ultra-light alloys: Dr. Bichler is developing ultra light weight novel Mg-based alloys with enhanced castability and mechanical performance. 

     The use of the proposed equipment will substantially improve the ability of engineers to develop a sustainable Canadian infrastructure system through the use of innovative materials with better performance and long service life, which will be economically viable and environmentally sound.

"This research proposal addresses problems in partial differential equations (PDE) and the 

calculus of variations arising from Ginzburg-Landau models of superconductivity, superfluidity, 

and ferromagnetism. In a Ginzburg-Landau model the state of a physical system is described 

as a critical point of a given energy functional. Critical points of the energy are solutions of 

systems of nonlinear elliptic PDE. Heuristic analysis shows that in certain parameter limits, the solutions may develop geometrical singularities (such as vortices, monopoles, or domain walls) which give the most salient features of the system and characterize its fundamental interactions and dynamics. 



My proposal is to use the rigorous tools of classical analysis to derive information about the 

number, shape, stability, and energies of geometrical singularities such as vortices, domain walls, and monopoles. Typically, the goal is to identify a limiting geometrical energy functional which arises naturally from the original Ginzburg-Landau functional, and whose critical points distill the essence of the solutions of the original PDE system by identifying their singularities. This task is accomplished within the G-convergence framework introduced by De Giorgi. 



To solve these problems it will be necessary to develop new methods in the analysis of nonlinear PDE, combining techniques based on geometrical measure theory, weak convergence, bifurcation theory, and elliptic regularity theory with heuristic ideas coming from physical insight and formal asymptotic expansions. The analytical results obtained will give a more complete and reliable understanding of these models and the phenomena they describe, while providing new perspectives on the rich interplay between analysis, geometry, and physics.

"Most individuals have some notion that our day-to-day living is highly dependent on the ability to form new memories. However, what most of us do effortlessly, is actually a very complicated biological, psychological, and neurochemical phenomenon. Scientists are only starting to learn about some of the important aspects that govern the formation of new memories. One important finding over the years is the fact that new memories are dependent on gene expression. In other words, the creation of new proteins, that are formed in precise detail from information contained in our DNA, are expressed by a complicated biochemical process. Scientists also believe that long-lasting anatomical changes occur in nerve cells that are the result of new experiences, learning, gene expression, and new memory formation. But exactly how this works is still not well understood. This applicant proposes that a specific type of protein, known as a transcription factor, actually regulates many different genes and is a mechanism for the generation of proteins involved in new memory formation. This protein, also called NF-kB, appears to be very important in new memory formation based on the applicant's past publications and recent preliminary data. In this very novel and exciting study, the applicant proposes to use cutting-edge methods, such as gene chips, in combination, with sophisticated electrical recording procedures in brain slices to evaluate NF-kB and the potential gene targets that this protein regulates. The study also proposes to use a transgenic mouse strain that has been genetically engineered to have a deficit in one of NF-kB's subunits (structural component) so that these ideas can be tested in a relevant model of memory formation. The study will also evaluate several behavioral parameters so that correlations can be made between brain slices and living animals. Given all this, the project is highly significant and original.  One important strength of this proposal is its wide scope in a timely and fundamental area of cognitive and neural science.

"Glass waveguide photonics.



The proposed research program deals with fundamental studies that will lead to the development of new laser light sources and optical sensor devices.  We use intense ultraviolet laser light to modify the properties of glasses and hence to fabricate structures into optical fibers and waveguides.  These structures allow ordinary fibers and waveguides to become lasers or advanced optical processing devices.  The main novelty that we are pursuing is the development of devices that are much smaller than currently available, and yet that will provide similar, and in some cases better performance.  Furthermore, our approach to develop these novel devices is inherently low cost both in terms of starting materials (glasses) and of experimental apparatus.  Much of the research is devoted towards finding the proper recipes to perform these irradiations and to choose or modify suitable glasses  so that the fabricated structures are performing as required and that they are reliable for real life applications.  



We are also investigating various applications for our novel structures, mainly in biochemical sensing  for environmental and health issues and in future high speed optical communications systems and networks.

"Inflammatory conditions can cause significant reductions in mammary gland function. This may lead to diminished milk production and quality and poorer nutrition to the nursing neonate. Our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammation explains our inability to efficiently treat this disease process. However, research is now linking the inflammatory process to possible reductions in nutrient utilization by cells, which ultimately leads to deleterious consequences on organ function. My research hypothesis proposes that this reduced nutrient utilization is due to the effects of inflammation on the transport processes that make these nutrients available to the mammary epithelial cell. The nutrient fuels that provide energy for cellular function, as well as a variety of other crucial nutrients, require proteins in cell membranes, called transporters, to move these substances into the cell. Consequently, the level of transporter expression in the mammary epithelial cell critically determines how much of these nutrients can enter the cell. Our understanding of the role of transporters in the mammary gland is limited and almost nothing is known of the influence of inflammatory disease on transporter function during lactation. My research program intends to fill this crucial knowledge gap. With a systematic assessment of the effects of inflammation on transporter expression and the consequences of these effects on mammary gland function and milk composition, this knowledge may identify nutritional intervention strategies to support efficient lactation during inflammation. The knowledge generated from this NSERC grant will provide important research discoveries that will benefit Canadian society from an economic (improved returns in our animal production industries), animal welfare (reduced animal loss), and environmental health (reduced antibiotic use in animal production) perspective. Furthermore, this research will oppose the rather quiet scientific undertakings in the lactating mother-neonate dyad, a vulnerable population that certainly deserves more investigative effort than this population currently receives.

An (n,k,d)_q-code is a collection of q^k n-tuples (codewords) over an alphabet of size q such that no two codewords agree in as many as n-d coordinates. A code is linear if it is a vector space. The singleton defect of C is S(C)=n-k+1-d. A fundamental problem in coding theory is the following:



Problem 1: Determine the maximum value of n for fixed k, q, and S(C).



We shall skirmish with Problem 1 for codes of small defect. 

Codes with S(C)=0 are called MDS (Maximum Distance Separable) codes.  Linear MDS codes and arcs in projective spaces are equivalent objects. MDS codes possess the strongest possible error correction ability and have found many applications from deep space communications to compact disk recording.  However, all known linear MDS codes are necessarily short and many applications would benefit from longer codes. This begs the question as to whether longer (nonlinear) MDS codes may be found.

The next best codes are those with S(C)=1, the AMDS (Almost-MDS) codes. A linear AMDS code without repeated coordinates is Near-MDS (NMDS). Linear (n,k,d)_q-NMDS codes and (n,k+1)-arcs in PG(k,q) are equivalent objects. Rational points of cubic curves provide (n,k+1)-arcs. Unlike MDS codes, there are many examples of AMDS codes exceeding the bounds (on length) provided by curves. We shall investigate Problem 1 and related extending, embedding, and uniqueness problems for MDS and AMDS codes.

"The Canadian Transport Ministry identified in its last Report on Plans and Priorities the need for a better inter-modal integration and consistent transportation infrastructure design and rehabilitation in order to sustain Canada's needs for productivity gains and overall economic growth.  The release of a recent study performed for Transport Canada, that investigated the cost of roadway urban congestion in Canada, shows that for nine metropolitan areas of the country the total annual congestion costs ranges between 2.0 and 3.4 billion (in 2002 dollars).  The availability of accurate and reliable traffic modeling tools impacts the effectiveness of traffic management authorities in addressing safety, security, and efficient utilization of national and regional roadways infrastructure.  

Currently, the state-of-the-art of large-scale traffic network modeling tools, in spite of recent substantial developments in this area, have mix success in striking the balance between the simplicity, versatility, efficiency, comprehensiveness, and flexibility of modeling the transportation networks.  The long term goal of the proposed research program is to develop a comprehensive modeling framework that integrates various traffic modeling tools.  This framework will encompass a collection of proposed theoretical models specialized in traffic analysis of various transportation facilities (expressways, arterials, intersections, etc.).  In addition, a comprehensive software package will be developed in order to integrate the proposed models in a modular approach.  This feature will facilitate future developments beyond the scope the first five-year term of the proposed research program, such as specialized traffic simulators, GIS interfaces, repository databases, analysis emulators, etc.  The major benefit of this research program is two-fold.  First, this program will provide transportation professionals communities, practitioners and researchers, a robust and integrated support that serves an array of purposes.  Second, this research will also provide support in educational activities of traffic engineering students at both levels, applied and basic-research.

"Investigation on the origin, evolution and structure of strongly interacting (hadronic) matter requires both experimental and theoretical effort. Chiral Perturbation Theory has been tremendously successful in describing low-energy hadronic interactions in the non-perturbative regime of Quantum Chromodynamics. The main purpose of our theoretical research is to take advantage of the new symbolic computing methods and to bring subatomic physics computations to the next level by developing a computational model with a consistent power counting scheme within relativistic Chiral Perturbation Theory.

Our recently developed Computational Hadronic Model already incorporates the octet of baryons, pseudoscalar mesons, and decuplet of resonances, and first we plan to expand it with the vector meson sector. After that, we will apply our new models, starting with the calculations of the electromagnetic nucleon formfactors using all of the possible degrees of freedoms of the effective chiral theory of strong interactions. The next application is calculations of amplitudes and cross sections for virtual Compton scattering retaining all the possible dynamical degrees of freedom. Our new Computational Hadronic Model, supplemented by the vector meson sector, can also be applied to the studies of the impact of the hadronic radiative corrections on the parity violating lepton-nucleon scattering. 

In the most general sense, we will develop and use the advanced symbolic computational methods to study various production or decay channels in hadronic physics with a new degree of precision. Although any practical outcomes of basic research such as a subatomic theory cannot be predicted immediately, such basic research is pushing the frontiers of human knowledge, and will eventually lay the foundations for new technologies.

"It is estimated that over 4,500 new cases of leukemia and 7,900 new cases of lymphoma will be diagnosed in Canada in 2008 (Canadian Cancer Society, 2008). In the US, those numbers rise to 44,000 new cases of leukemia and 74,000 new cases of lymphoma (SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2005). A common treatment for these diseases, as well as many other diseases, is bone marrow transplantation. As part of a patient's preparation for a bone marrow transplant, the patient's existing bone marrow must be eradicated. This is typically achieved through a combination of chemotherapy and total marrow irradiation (TMI).

      Current TMI treatment methods leave much to be desired in terms of organ sparing and target coverage (adequate dose delivery to the bone marrow). TMI treatments are performed by aiming a small number of possible radiation beams at the patient. The patient is positioned far from the radiation source in order to treat large areas at once. Although it is possible to protect some of the patient's organs using shields, this type of therapy generally does not allow for effective sparing of most of the organs. Additionally, uncertainty in the dose delivery due to the patient's position far from the radiation source results in higher than necessary radiation dose delivered to the patient to ensure complete marrow elimination. This additional dosage can lead to undesirable toxicity effects in healthy tissue, and can even cause secondary cancers.

      This research aims to employ beam orientation optimization to select beams to use in the treatment so that the patient can be moved to a standard distance from the radiation source, thereby eliminating the uncertainty that leads to necessary overdosage in current treatment techniques. The reduction in uncertainty also allows for the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), a type of radiation delivery that provides for more organ sparing and better target coverage than conventional radiotherapy delivery techniques. New models for describing organ motion will also be explored. This research formulates the treatment planning problem as a mathematical optimization model and develops solution algorithms that obtain quality TMI plans using IMRT.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Industrial Engineering",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"One of the fundamental goals of software engineering is to enable predictable and modular construction and evolution of software systems by assembling software architecture components. However, due to the increasing complexity, distributed, and dynamic nature of current information systems, undetected integration failures from internal violations may be ultimately revealed only as costly accidents that often cause undesirable system crashes. In addition, interface and configuration issues frequently arise from misunderstanding, incompatibilities, or differences resulting from independent development practices, heterogeneous environments, or different vendors. As a result, since maintaining and changing this class of (Web-based) distributed and dynamic software systems usually requires the examination and modification of components and component interactions, system integration becomes difficult to maintain as system components are extended or upgraded. The main goal of this project is to define and evaluate a new recombinant and evolutionary software architecture approach, and supporting methods and tools, for component-based design, integration, evolution, and analysis. The approach is based on formal abstract models of distributed event-based recombinant components, extended component interfaces, concern and process-based evolutionary extensions, and integration and evolution contracts that can provide a more expressive definition of component-based system design representations and an enhanced analysis of the interaction of architectural components, their extended functionality and behavior, and their compositions.  In a general way, the results of this research can impact individuals or (Canadian) organizations that are struggling to produce large, complex (dynamic) systems and applications, and can help push the drive to improve productivity, software quality, reduce maintenance overheads, and impact on the establishment of a marketplace of contract-based software components. In addition, we are convinced that providing a non-ad-hoc and comprehensive component integration and evolution theory and its automated support will radically improve software engineering efforts.

"With increasing mobility of populations worldwide, the spread of infectious diseases has become a matter of growing concern to public health. In particular, the imminent threat of pandemic influenza is receiving serious international attention. Along with other developed countries, Canada now has a pandemic preparedness plan. Underlying all health planning is the need to understand how pathogens interact with their hosts, adapt, and are transmitted through the population. Clinical or experimental approaches to epidemic interventions, by themselves, are often expensive, impractical, or even unethical. Mathematical and computer modelling of infectious diseases have become recognized as valuable tools for probing these systems, and determining the conditions that lead on the one hand to the spread of epidemics, and on the other to suggesting public health strategies for disease control or mitigation. Rapid advances in virology and immunology provide a wealth of useful information that has not yet been exploited in mathematical or computer models of these complex processes. Limitations of computer power to represent the vast range of scales of complexity compel one to adopt statistical descriptions of the underlying processes. The present proposal aims to take advantage of recent developments in applications of statistical mechanics to complex networks, to formulate self-consistent dynamical models of disease transmission and epidemic spread. These models will allow co-evolution of network structures (at the macro-scale) and pathogen transmission processes (at the micro-scale). Methods will be developed for statistical representations of complex networks in terms of indices that are critical determinants of their global, 'emergent' behaviour. These results will enable comparison of critical network properties deduced from idealized networks with those measured in real networks.  It is anticipated that such an approach will afford otherwise unobtainable insights into disease propagation that will suggest effective preventive control strategies or contingency plans during an outbreak, and thus provide useful insights for planning public health policy.

"This research proposal deals with the design of a new field effect transistor (FET) and the investigation of the properties of nitride semiconductors. The FET applies a new principle for formation of the channel conductivity based on tunnel injection of charges (electrons or holes) through a hetero-junction. These charges are a product of destroying of excitons of the structure located in the region of the hetero-junction. The proposed configuration includes a high resistance layer of GaN that acts as a FET channel. The hetero-junction is formed between this layer and an InGaN layer. The excitons of the structure are located within the InGaN. They are being destroyed if an electrical field of sufficient strength is applied on the GaN/InGaN hetero-structure. If the positive pole of the electrical field is connected to the FET-gate, the electrons of exciton origin penetrate into the GaN layer forming electron-type conductivity. If the negative pole is connected to the FET-gate, the holes of exciton origin penetrate into GaN forming a hole-type conductivity. In both cases the charge penetration is based on tunnel injection through a hetero-junction and the charges penetrate into the semiconductor with wider energy band gap (GaN). N-channel FET and p-channel FET are subjects of both design and technological performance. The objective of the project is to create a fast FET with potential application in both high frequency circuits and fast VLSI circuits based on nitride semiconductors. The dielectric function and the life-time of the excitons of the structure of several semiconductors related to InN are subjects of theoretical and experimental investigations according to the proposal. The electron band structure and the properties of MnGaN will be studied as well, because MnGaN is a promising semiconductor with application in both conventional and cryogenic electronics.

"In most service industries, especially the telecommunication systems, service providers usually want to determine a single statistic associated with a performance measure, such as queue length or waiting times, 

to be used as an indicator of users' quality of service (QoS).  The statistic often used as a single measure is the mean value.  Mean values are however viewed as not good indicator of performance measure for purpose of determining QoS as far as a user is concerned.  Tail probabilities are more meaningful and accepted as better measures.  For example, telling a user that their waiting time will not exceed a given value with a certain probability (tail probability) is more meaningful than been told that their average (mean) waiting time is of a particular value. Estimating the tail probabilities of performance measures is critical for service providers in planning their systems.  They need such statistic in order to assess how successful their system is perceived to be by users and this is what in the end determines what users subscribe to the system which translates to revenue (and profit) to service providers. The challenge, however, is how to determine the tail probabilities of a measure without computing the whole distribution, since it is usually very cumbersome to obtain a whole distribution in a practical real life system.  The aim of this proposal is to develop exact and approximate techniques for estimating the tail probabilities for measures in systems that have light tails, i.e for which the tail has a geometric decay property.  For such cases we only need to compute two parameters; the decay rate and the decay (asymptotic) constant.  There are several methods for computing decay rates, but hardly any for computing decay constants. We plan to improve existing techniques for computing decay rates and develop approximate techniques for computing decay constants for single node queues, and then extend the results to tandem queues for applications in telecommunication systems.

"Suppose we have a wireless network of mobile sensors, where any two sensors can communicate with each other only if they are within a certain range. These sensors, for example, could be attached to some endangered animals to help track their movement. If the location of each sensor is known, then computing the inter-sensor distances of this network is a trivial problem. However, the inverse problem of determining the location of each sensor knowing only some of their inter-sensor distances is a hard problem. This information on the inter-sensor distances is obtained via the communication links between the sensors. Solving this problem enables us to track the movement of these sensors in situations where GPS is either unavailable or too expensive. 

The same mathematical problem also arises in the context of molecular conformations.  There one wishes to determine the shape of a given molecule using available information on some of its inter-atomic distances. This information can be obtained using NMR, for example. The importance of this problem stems from the fact that the shape of a molecule plays a pivotal role in determining its chemical and biological properties. The same problem also arises in statistics and in satellite ranging etc.

The objective of my proposed research is to devise methods for solving the problem of determining the locations of a set of points using partial information on their inter-point distances. Also, I intend to study some other related problems in distance geometry.

"The equipment requested is a potentiostate and accessories. This unit will be required to support research on the electrochemical aspects of pressure leaching and corrosion at high temperatures and high pressures (HT/HP) and fuel cells. In addition, the potentiostate will be the other major component in the planned construction of a unique, innovative research facility, which will allow in-situ measurements of electrochemical parameters at HT/HP. This proposed configuration would be achieved by interfacing the potentiostate with an autoclave. 

 

At present, no similar potentiostate is available at this institution for this purpose. The applicant's current and long term research plans are in the areas of electrochemical processes, fuel cells, hydrometallurgy and corrosion at HT/HP. Research investigations range from performing experiments on the electrochemical aspects of pressure leaching of laterite and sulfide ores to the assessment of the corrosion behavior of materials and advanced materials at HT/HP, to understanding electrode process in fuel cells. These research activities require the use of state of the art potentiostate. 



Other researchers at the University of British Columbia would have access to this equipment as well. Since this would be the only potentiostate-autoclave system at UBC, its acquisition would have a major impact not only on the research of the applicant, but also on the research of other researchers at the University and in the region.

"Acid mist emission is a problem in many electrolysis operations because it presents a health hazard to the workers in the cellhouse and corrodes the surrounding equipment.  It is also a significant source of environmental pollution.  Xstrata's Kidd Zinc Electrowinning Plant is seeking to replace Dowfroth 250 as an acid mist suppressant and optimize their reagent addition scheme.

The overall objective of this proposal is to provide a practical replacement for Dowfroth 250, ideally, the lab-scale program undertaken here would identify a reagent mixture, which would exceed current performance.  On a more fundamental level there remain many uncertainties related to the interaction between impurities in the electrolyte, organic additives (such as mist suppressants) and the electrochemical processes, which occur at the electrode surfaces.  These interactions can take principally two forms: (1) The reduction or improvement of efficiencies at the electrode surface and (2) the promotion of electrode decay through corrosion phenomena.  The latter is particularly true for the anode surface and for the cathode near the water line.  The project is intended to close the knowledge gap by applying innovative research.  This study will involve experimental determination of the influence of a number of reagents and process parameters on the zinc electrowinning process.

A post doctoral fellow, two summer students and a research engineer will be trained in this research project.  The current study offers an opportunity to understand more of the fundamental aspects of the electrowinning of zinc in industrial solutions.  Such understanding is essential to improve the chemical process and optimize the energy efficiency of the Xstrata operation.  The information generated from this effort will also be applicable to other electrowinning operations in Canada and worldwide.  This information would lead to significant savings in operation costs of the current and future electrowinning processing plants.","Ressources min�rales (prospection, exploration, mines, extraction et pr�paration)","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"Process modeling is an integral part of process control and process optimization. The latter is increasingly a concern in metals industry as improvements in energy efficiency and environmental impact are sought.  The Canadian-based company Aurel systems is currently interested in expanding its expertise and application credentials for its software package CADSim Plus into the mining and metals industry principally through the development of simulators aimed at electrowinning.  This research project proposes new modeling approaches which will aim to leverage the benefits of the developed CADSim software and the expertise of UBC faculty to generate industrially relevant models which will be directly applicable to the end users.  Two Canadian based companies namely Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting and Xstrata Zinc, as key end users, are also sponsoring and actively involved in the project. 



The research will work to generate a fully dynamic and representative model of current zinc electrowinning plant practice to include the effects of inorganic/organic impurities and additives on cell efficiency.  It is expected that the model would become flexible enough to be applicable to any electrowinning process including those aimed at the recovery of copper, nickel and cobalt for example.



Four students will be involved in the project and they will be trained in mathematical modeling and simulation, electrochemistry, and electrometallurgy, which are important to the mining and chemical industries in Canada. At the end of their training, the HPQ will be ready to enter the job market in Canada and make immediate contributions.

"The long-term viability of the SCWR will be determined in part by the stability of the materials that will contact the coolant.  Experience with existing reactors has shown that corrosion, fuel fouling and activity transport can be minimized if the chemistry of the coolant in the Heat Transport System (HTS) is controlled within optimal limits.  Thus, to ensure the components achieve their design life, it is necessary to monitor and control the important chemical parameters, such as electrical conductivity, pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), concentrations of dissolved ions and of redox species and particulate content.   Many of the methods used to monitor these parameters for existing reactors are not appropriate for SCW applications, mainly because of the significant change in physical properties associated with the phase change.  Existing methods are generally ex-situ.  Small 'grab' samples are taken from the coolant and chemically analyzed 'off-line' at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.  Unfortunately, the results of these analyses can vary with sampling location, and some properties, such as dissolved oxygen, cannot be reliably measured because of reactions with the sampling systems.  These problems are expected to be worse for SCWR conditions.  It is not obvious how knowledge of the chemistry of grab samples analyzed at room temperature and pressure can be usefully extrapolated to SCW conditions, where things like solubility, density, viscosity and dielectric constant can change by orders of magnitude.  Thus, it is expected that key chemistry parameters for the SCWR will have to be monitored with in-situ on-line sensors.  

The proposed project would start with a review of chemistry sensors for existing and SCW reactor applications, and provide recommendations for future developments.  This would be followed by further research into the most promising sensors, and would include designing, building and testing of new and improved models in the SCW loops at UBC, which will be modified to operate under proposed SCWR conditions. The proposed work will involve collaboration between UBC and AECL for a period of 3 years.

In addition, suitable alloy(s) for the boiler tube overlay or methods relating to corrosion protection which would increase the service life of the boiler tubes will be recommended. It is intended to further the knowledge gap by applying innovative research. Specific objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to carry out a thorough failure analysis of boiler tubes at Tech-Cominco's KIVCET smelter to define root cause of failure and assist in understanding the complex corrosion mechanism, (2) to study the effects salts and the composition of the off-gas on the corrosion performance of Alloy 625 and others potential alloys, (3) to provide a better fundamental understanding of corrosion mechanism of Alloy 625 and other alloy under the boiler conditions, using both thermochemical modeling and experimental approaches and (4) to recommend the best suitable alloy systems for application at as boiler overlay at Teck-Cominco KIVCET smelter. The study will involve a detailed literature review, failure analysis on representative samples of corroded / failed tubing, thorough physical and chemical characterization of representative deposit samples and thermochemical analysis of the system will be undertaken to determine the stability and equilibria in both the gas phase and phase stability in the deposits, using commercial software FactSage and HSC. Also, an extensive experimental testing program on Alloy 625 and selected candidate alloys will be performed. The testwork will be divided into two types, high temperature corrosion testing using a tube furnace, and electrochemical testing using an autoclave, and high temperature furnace. A post doctoral fellow and a Ph.D. student will work on this research project. The anticipated benefits of the work to Canada and to Teck-Cominco are significant and will have a direct impact on the ability of Canadian companies, to compete effectively in the global market.

"VIREX is a system initially developed at the University of Calgary to facilitate the transformation of relational and object-oriented data into XML format. It has a visual user-friendly flexible interface that allows users to specify their queries and requests with minimum keyboard usage. After getting the first web based version of VIREX, our plan is to expand VIREX to suport a variety of web related applications; and hence turn VIREX into a comprehensive service-oriented system that satisfies the needs of a wide range of users.

The main applications of VIREX considered by this research program include, fuzzy query interface, information extraction from the web, content-based image retrieval (CBIR), social network analysis, and gene expression data analysis. The last three applications are attractive because of the growing amount of related information available on the web. The aim is to have VIREX work in a human-understandable way by supporting fuzzy queries. For this task, we will develop an approach capable of analyzing the underlying data, decide on the fuzzy sets for more effective query evaluation. Further, the web is a huge exponentially growing repository, and we will be able to take advantage of the information stored if there is an automated process to extract relevant information and store it in structured databases. CBIR is another application investigated by this proposed research program. Similarity search techniques and clustering the images based on their content will improve their retrieval. It has also been recently realized that knowledge discovery and machine learning techniques are effective for analyzing social networks to extract useful information that guides in identifying terrorist networks, criminal networks and for targeted marketing. The same also applies to gene networks. 

To meet the needs of the considered applications, the main objective of this research program is to  develop novel techniques for clustering, classification, similarity search and feature reduction by integrating fuzziness, multi-objective optimization, and multi-agents in the process. This will turn VIREX into  an attractive system providing a comprehensive integrated solution for a range of problems.

"Managing multiple mobile cranes and multiple heavy lifts on congested industrial site requires planning and preparing collision free paths. Selecting optimum cranes and identifying spatial conflict-free locations on sites can result in productivity and safety improvements of large-scale industrial construction projects. Generally, selecting mobile cranes and developing engineered lift studies is done based on the lift-capacity specifications of the selected cranes provided by crane manufactures where each lift is individually analyzed. Currently, experienced lift engineers select cranes based on the heaviest lift and/or the largest lifting radius of the identified crane. This practice is relatively time consuming and optimizing the mobile crane's use and location is difficult. This research is a CRD carried out at the University of Alberta and sponsored by PCL Industrial Management Inc and NSERC. This research focuses on industrial projects and using multiple mobile cranes for multiple heavy lifts. The proposed research aims at developing a decision support system to optimize crane selection, multiple heavy lift optimizations and collision-free path planning using existing crane databases. This project will employ advanced mathematical algorithms to solve spatial cranes tasks. Crane operation will be translated into a 3D simulation module for checking potential spatial conflicts between building components and crane movements. The resulting data will be formatted to allow for future simulation and lift analysis. The results of this research will introduce best practice and innovative construction methods for crane utilization on construction sites. Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of this research, it provides a unique opportunity for students, faculties and industry partners to learn from each other, to explore together and to achieve the research goals. This research is vitally important as the oil sands projects in Alberta need to reduce cost and time associated with construction operations involving cranes. This technology will also improve construction safety because the operations will be visualized on a computer and a collision-free path will be identified before the actual on site operations.","M�thodes de construction","Construction, urbanisme et am�nagement rural","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Alberta,Alberta
"As demand for productivity continues to grow in the residential construction in Canada, new and unexpected issues have arisen concerning the minimization and avoidance of waste. The majority of residential buildings are predominantly comprised of wood-framed homes built on-site using conventional methods and materials, such as cast-in-place concrete basement walls and wood platform-framing structures. In spite of rising costs and innovative opportunities in this sector, the current practice adheres to traditional means of construction that possess drawbacks, including the following: high labour costs, high construction material wastes, low efficiencies, environmental impacts from disposal and transportation of wastes, and minimal technological advancement. Just as in any discipline, the evolution of these methods and approaches must coincide with the current circumstances in the construction industry. The objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive material waste minimization program in order to enhance sustainable development and promote innovation in the residential construction field. The following five steps outline the research methodology: 1) Thorough review of literature and field study of current practices with respect to construction material waste in order to develop a knowledge-based expert system; 2) Identification and detailed examination of the factors that contribute to residential construction material wastes; 3) Investigate opportunities for automation of existing methods and processes as alternatives to current practices; 4) Application of the strategies in a specific case study and subsequent report of the findings; 5) Implementation of best practice concepts to minimize construction waste in the industry. The major challenge of this research is the development of a comprehensive and holistic model of residential construction material waste minimization. Today, and in the future, researchers must consider not only the advancement of the discipline and industry, but also their responsibility to the concept of sustainable development. In summary, the Canadian residential construction industry needs to adopt advanced technology and methodology to foster sustainable development and to benefit stakeholders. The research being performed here is an attempt to draw attention to and remedy these issues.

"The efficiency of a construction project is determined by the effectiveness of the specific model used to communicate information. Architects use 2D or 3D CAD models to develop a project design; construction engineers use management tools and software to assist in project control and integration. Today, we rely solely on the project participants' own ability to interpret these discipline-specific models in order to form a mental picture of a proposed design and its corresponding construction approach. Advanced computer tools can be used to prepare smart designs that integrate these discipline-specific models in order to coordinate cross-disciplinary tools used for design, construction, and facility management decisions. Integrating these models with lean thinking concepts and simulation will eliminate non-value adding tasks. The objectives of the proposed research is dual in nature: (1) to advance the science of construction automation in order to reduce the gap between existing discipline-specific models, and (2) to support the use of information integration for designing and constructing projects. The success of this research will result in information integration between various disciplines, eliminating or reducing the gap information between discipline-specific models. The proposed 3D-model becomes an active virtual model throughout the lifecycle of the project, which is integrated through a concept referred to herein as ""Information-Cube (i3)."" (i3) is defined in this proposal as a registry comprised of three components: information, innovation, and intelligence. At each node, practitioners assess project information (graphic and project planning); potential innovations in terms of alternative; and provide the intelligence evaluating material and process wastes, utilizing lean thinking and simulation in order to assess the proposed construction method in terms of efficiency, cost, schedule, and environmental impact. Most of this information is expected to be added to the 3D-Solid model during the design stage and throughout the progression of the project (during construction and commissioning); (i3) remains active and open for innovation, making the 3D-model a dynamic intelligent repository of project information.","M�thodes de construction","Construction, urbanisme et am�nagement rural","Civil Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"My research over the last six years, carried out in collaboration with several doctoral students and with co-workers in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Mexico has moved in three directions: (1) developing a unified group theoretical framework  for understanding wavelet transforms and Wigner functions, (2) constructing vector coherent states over matrix domains, and studying the ensuing problem of Berezin quantization and (3) construction of wavelet-like and time-frequency transforms on non-Euclidean surfaces. The work is of mathematical interest in the theory of square-integrable group representations and matrix models, as well as to applied problems of signal analysis over non-flat geometries. In the next five years, it is my intention to continue working in all three directions. The work on Wigner functions will be continued over general symmetric spaces, as an extension of an earlier result. This, should open up the possibility of defining signal transforms for a number of interesting signal geometries. Mathematically, it would lead to a deeper understanding of the Wigner fuction, as defined on a phase space. The construction of vector coherent states over matrix domains was a new idea introduced by us, which extends the standard theory of vector coherent states. The homogeneous spaces of many semi-simple Lie groups are naturally matrix domains. The vector coherent states that we have introduced there lead to spaces of analytic functions, in terms of matrix variables. Currently, I am studying Berezin-type quantization, using such coherent states and their associated reproducing kernels. A related problem is to study the classical limits of such quantized theories, particularly since they seem to touch on questions of non-commutative geometry. Another interesting problem that we intend to explore in depth  is the possibility of constructing vector coherent states for supersymmetric Hamiltonians. The work on wavelets and time-frequency transforms will build on some recent results obtained by different groups. We are proposing a group theoretical and a geometrical model for developing such transforms. The work has already attracted wide attention within the research community.

"Raw meat has none of the aroma of cooked meat as the characteristic aroma is largely generated during cooking. In fact, the flavor compounds are generated via chemical reactions occurring between natural precursors present in raw meat during heating. Among these natural flavor precursors, sugars and sugar phosphates, and particularly five carbon sugars (pentoses) play a major role in generating the desirable aroma and flavor of cooked meat via the Maillard reaction. However, the biochemical pathways leading to the formation of these pentoses in meat are not fully understood. The accepted route for the formation of ribose, a five carbon sugar and a key flavor precursor in meat via the breakdown of ATP in muscle post-mortem, cannot explain the formation of all pentoses present in meat. For instance, ribulose-5-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, xylulose have been identified in various types of meat (chicken, beef and rabbit) while their biochemical origins remain unexplained. Biochemical pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway may well be involved and could be muscle and/or species dependent. In addition, it is not clear how meat conditioning affects the formation and/or evolution of key flavor precursors' concentrations with time, and to what extent this step is muscle/species dependent. This NSERC discovery proposal aims to employ chemical and biochemical approaches to clarify the role of selected biochemical reactions in generating the key flavor precursors (pentoses) in selected skeletal muscles post-mortem. A comparative study using both white meat (chicken breast and leg) and popular Canadian lean red meats (bison and elk) is designed to elucidate firstly, the muscle and/or species dependency of the selected biochemical reactions important for meat flavor and secondly, to study the effect of meat conditioning on key flavor precursors in each type of meat. Model systems will be employed to investigate the role of candidate flavor precursors in selected meats and their contribution to the characteristic aroma and flavor of each selected muscle. This research program will help to understand the formation of flavor precursors in meat and will ultimately help with selection of genetic markers for flavor.

"The proposed research program aims at advancing the research results and developments achieved during the term of the current discovery grant in the area of automation and decision support systems for construction industry. The research program aims at the development of: 1) automated information-technology based construction management techniques and decision support systems for optimized delivery of building projects and facilities. 2) intelligent systems and methods for sustainable infrastructure systems. In the area of automated decision support systems the focus will primarily be on the development of construction engineering and management tools, methods and support systems using intelligent systems, wireless communication and web technologies for data and knowledge processing with a focus on improving productivity of the Canadian Construction Industry. This include developing a dynamic material takeoff and cost estimation using 3D-Virtual and web environment, maintenance and rehabilitation plans for buildings and lifecycle analysis and costing for sustainable buildings. In the area of sustainable infrastructure the focus will primarily be on developing intelligent systems for maintenance and rehabilitation plans for bridges. The deterioration of bridges has become a major safety and economic concern. One of the major factors causing this problem comes from the unreliable data gathered during the inspection and monitoring of the infrastructure. Eventually, the maintenance and rehabilitation decisions based on this information and data are not as reliable and competitive. It shows that there is a dire need to introduce and test a methodology to evaluate the reliability of data collected through inspections and wireless communication techniques, and to develop intelligent decision support systems to assist in planning and budgeting the maintenance and rehabilitation of the infra-structure based on its lifecycle cost. The proposed research program, accordingly, contributes to efforts being made to improve construction productivity, as well improve public safety and economic well being. The proposed program will also contribute in training of highly qualified personnel in vital sectors of Canadian economy.","M�thodes de construction","Construction, urbanisme et am�nagement rural","Civil Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Gas move in soils because soils are porous media with connected pores. This gas movement allows billions of organisms such as plants, bacteria, and fungus to breathe and decompose products (e.g. hydrocarbons). These activities generate gases that must be eliminated from the soil toward the atmosphere to avoid toxicity. Gases, as for water, do not homogeneously move in soils. Gases use pathways through only a portion of the soil, called 'preferential flow pathways', which favour faster movement of gases than it would be predicted with models if the gases would be moving through the bulk soil volume. Preferential flow is caused by soil heterogeneities of all sizes. PF affects the growth of plants and micro-organisms, chemical-reactions, efficiency of soil decontamination systems and gas capturing systems in landfills, etc. Very little is known on PF of gases in soils. The main objective of this research is to understand and quantify PF of gas in soils under several conditions (e.g. frozen, wet, with macropores). Laboratory experiments will be conducted on repacked soil columns and on large monoliths in which soil heterogeneity is as observed in the field. The monoliths will be scanned (CT scanner as in hospitals) to describe soil porosity in three dimensions and correlate the porosity structure with PF of gas. This project is an important step in improving knowledge on gas flux in soil. It will help in developing more appropriate models, soil management and decontamination, improving data interpretation relative to plant, microbes, oxydo-reduction reactions, and efficiency of engineering processes in soils.

"A collaborative investigation has been initiated by the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) and Standard Aero Limited (SAL) of Winnipeg. The objectives of the project are to study compressor instabilities, to investigate the internal aerodynamic characteristics of the major engine stages and their influences on downstream components, and to quantify the temperature profile at the exit of a combustion chamber. The program will initially explore rotating compressor stall in the axial stage of a Rolls Royce Allison A250 gas turbine. Three follow-on research thrusts will explore the centrifugal stage on the same rig, while an existing combustion chamber test rig will be used to explore the effects of inlet disturbances on the combustion chamber. Finally, compressor discharge ducts will be surveyed and modelled to determine influences between the two major components. SAL is a major global overhauler and engineering developer of the A250 gas turbine engine and the insight gained will be applied to improving their role as an engineering service provider. HQP specifically post-graduate students will be drawn from SAL employees; other students will be attracted from conventional sources.

The first phase of the project will see the completion of an internal combustion engine-driven, axial compressor rig, from which pre-stall signals will be recorded from high speed pressure transducers. Stall will be initiated using a throttle, and high speed data acquisition will be used to record the events. The rig has been designed to allow the centrifugal compressor stage to be independently tested in a follow-on phase. This research is a natural fit for the RMC research group which has substantial experience with ambient rigs and engine representative conditions. With the rig, it will be possible to investigate flow and combustion instabilities in great detail. Data collected will support parallel computational and numerical studies. The first phase of this project is underway; the first of five post-graduate students has entered the research phase and is expected to graduate in the winter of 2008.","A�rospatial","Services et syst�mes de transport","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Ontario,Ontario

"Polymer-surfactant pairs play a critical role in many cosmetic and agriculture products as well as paint and pharmaceutical formulations.  The high molecular weight polymers and low molecular weight surfactants are often combined to take advantage of their unique and synergistic properties; for example, the mechanical properties of the polymer and self-assembly behavior of the surfactant. However, polymer-surfactant systems have not been fully exploited for use in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications due to the lack of information available on combinations of biopolymers and nonionic surfactants.  To date, most of the fundamental studies on polymer-surfactant systems have included charged surfactants (e.g. sodium dodecyl sulfate) which have limited potential for use in biomedical applications due to their poor safety and toxicity profiles.    In this way, the selection of appropriate biopolymer- nonionic surfactant pairs for biomedical applications often proceeds by trial and error.  

    The current research is focused on establishing models to explain the behavior of solutions and properties of films formed from the natural, biocompatible polymer chitosan and nonionic surfactants.  Experimental studies and computer simulations will be employed in order to gain insight into the interactions and microstructure present within these systems.  Comparison of the results from the experimental and in silico studies will allow for validation of the computational methods which may be used in the future for rapid identification of the optimal polymer-surfactant pairs for specific applications.  The functional properties of the chitosan-surfactant systems will also be evaluated in order to establish the relationships between composition, molecular organization or microstructure and performance.

"In the blooming field of nanotechnology, we are still in the infancy of tool development at this small scale. The interaction of these tools with the environment surrounding them, including complex molecules which can be bigger than the tool itself (!), is not well understood. The tools we are interested in are crystalline semiconductor particles so small that one could fit more than ten thousands of them on the edge of a piece of paper. These nanometer-sized particles are called quantum dots to underline that their behaviour is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. In this sense, they behave like artificial atoms for which we can engineer the properties eventually leading to entirely new materials. However compared to the natural atoms, we don't have the equivalent of a periodic table of elements to guide us on how the quantum dots interact together and with other molecules. To probe this interaction, we will use the light emitted by the quantum dots. The color (wavelength) of this light is one of the properties we can engineer simply by changing the quantum dot size. The emitted light also blink on and off randomly when the quantum dots are synthesized and kept in a liquid, but these fluctuations interestingly do not occur when the quantum dots are grown in a semiconductor solid. With the light intensity and wavelength, the statistics of this blinking constitute a third parameter to investigate the collective interaction dynamics of the atoms inside and outside the quantum dots. Three types of quantum dot samples will be probed through their emitted light: one where the quantum dots are on a semiconductor surface, one where the quantum dots will be buried just below the semiconductor surface within range of quantum interactions and one where the quantum dots are embedded in conductive polymers. With this last sample, we will be able to give energy to the quantum dots by passing current through the conductive polymer device whereas the other samples receive energy via excitation with a laser. Research on quantum dots in this organic polymer device will contribute to the development of a whole new generation of transparent, flexible, light-weight and even printable technologies from solar cells to light emitting devices.

"Fractured rock aquifers represent a significant percentage of global aquifer systems. Groundwater flow in such aquifers is difficult to characterize due to the presence of discrete fractures, which are often variably distributed and, therefore, difficult to identify, sample, and represent in numerical models. In addition, the important processes governing recharge, subsurface flow, interaction with surface water bodies, are all complex. Thus, evaluation of the long-term sustainability of groundwater resources in fractured rock aquifers (watersheds), in light of growing population and climate change, presents significant challenges. 

   The proposed research aims to develop an understanding of recharge mechanisms in fractured rock aquifers, particularly mountainous watersheds, and develop methodologies that can be used to represent, both conceptually and practically, fractured aquifer recharge in structurally complex terrain. Case studies in Okanagan Basin will focus on quantifying groundwater recharge in mountainous watersheds through the use of field studies, numerical modeling, and isotopic analysis for identifying sources contributions to recharge. This contribution will further our efforts to model large-scale systems, which almost always have diverse structural heterogeneity, for the purpose of determining groundwater resource sustainability. The research also aims to determine the sensitivity of recharge in fractured rock aquifers to climate change and forecast how groundwater resources in such aquifers might respond to climate change. Case studies will be conducted in the Gulf Islands and Mali (Africa) using global climate model data for predicting climate shifts, and remotely sensing variations in groundwater storage with time using satellite data (GRACE satellite).

Hybridization (interbreeding of species) and polyploidy (chromosome doubling) are widespread phenomena in the flowering plants. Together they lead to new combinations of traits that can become stabilized as new allopolyploid species, with fundamental consequences for plant evolution. This is often of practical importance, for example when assessing the taxonomic status of rare species or the consequences of interbreeding between crop plants and related weeds. It is therefore important to understand how polyploid hybrids arise and evolve. This work focuses on the importance of hybridization in two distinct plant groups, fawn-lilies (Erythronium) and North American asters (Symphyotrichum). Evolutionary relationships are well understood in these groups, allowing hybrids to be readily detected using molecular tools. This project makes use of DNA sequence data from specific chloroplast and nuclear gene regions that give fine-scale resolution of relationships. It has several components:  (1) phylogenetic analyses and detection of hybridization (especially leading to polyploid hybrids) in these groups; (2) determination of hybrid frequency and parentage; and (3) investigation of the genetic characteristics of allopolyploids, including changes in duplicated genes, by comparison of natural allopolyploid species with their parent species and by synthesis of artificial hybrids from the same parents. This work will enhance understanding of the ways in which new genetic forms are created and maintained in plants.

"Microalgal technologies, used as a method of conversion of (sun)light to liquid fuels, hold several advantages over conventional crops: they can produce up to 100 times more biomass per unit of crop area; the lipid content of this biomass can be up to 70% (dry basis); the doubling time can be in the order of few days; and they can grow in aggressive environments, including saline or even alkaline waters. Despite all these advantages, biodiesel produced using current microalgal cultivation and processing technology is not economic. Most of the costs are associated with various separation and extraction steps that have not been addressed. Furthermore, a ""biorefinery"" (multi-product) approach to microalgae processing could significantly improve the overall process economics. To address these issues we propose the use of a microalgal biofilm technology whereby microalgae will grow in photoreactors packed with a fibrous substrate (large area to volume ratios). By simple changes in the feed to the reactor we plan to evaluate various aqueous extraction techniques, ranging from aggressive alkaline emulsions (designed to break the cell walls and extract all the biomass) to mild non-toxic

microemulsion solvents used to ""milk"" (extract high value-added lipids without killing the cells) the microalgae. Further to lipid extraction, we plan to introduce membrane-based separations of proteins and carbohydrates that can be used for food and bio-fuel production. Our two industrial partners, Biox and Ocean Nutrition, are interested in high quality, low cost lipids for fuel and food production, respectively. They will be involved in the development of the separation technologies and assessing the value of the extracted lipids as feedstock in their respective processes. Further to the production of biomass for food and fuels, the proposed biofilm reactors will also be used in combination with treated wastewater to further reduce costs and and reduce nutrient discharges to the environment. Due to the large surface area to volume ratio, close control of temperature and gas transfer, the biofilm reactor is expected to occupy a relatively small foot print, and therefore be suitable for use in industrial and municipal settings in Canada.","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario

"The key mandate of Cambrian's Sustainable Energy Centre is twofold: to train the next generation of technicians, technologists and skill trades people in energy systems technologies, environmental impact and monitoring/remediation, and sustainable building; and to lead applied research and innovation in these areas. Working closely with SME's, government and industry partners, research teams comprised of faculty and students/interns will undertake a variety of applied research projects, three of which we are as follows: Phytoremediation, an innovative technology that uses suitable woody or herbaceous plants for the purpose of containment, destruction, or extraction of environmental contaminants, can offer a sustainable technology application that has the potential to realize considerable cost savings compared to conventional treatments. An economical and practically viable method of contaminated soil remediation could eliminate/minimize human health risks, as well as greatly improve local landscape esthetics, soil quality and ecosystem health. Cambrian's Phytoextraction of Heavy Metals from Contaminated Sudbury Soils project proposes to investigate the technique of phytoextraction for the clean-up of low to moderate concentrations of heavy metals from residential and industrial soils impacted by mining and smelting.



Current designs for stabilizing energy produced by wind power and stored in Hydrogen Electrolyzer/Fuel cells not only offer poor efficiency and storage capacity, but also have not been thoroughly tested for residential application in northern environments. Cambrian's project proposes to develop and assess a more efficient design and determine the feasibility of implementing this design as an off-grid energy alternative for residential buildings in northern climates. To further support off-grid energy systems, Cambrian's final project aims to develop and optimize the design parameters and construct a prototype of a high efficiency heat battery that will allow the optimal storage of solar energy in thermal form and allow for its use on demand for residential application in northern regions.

"Topology is a branch of mathematics that deals with spatial properties of objects that are preserved under continuous deformations (such as stretching or squeezing an object without tearing or gluing any of its parts). In this branch, we do not ask how big an object is or what is its extension in space but, rather; is it all connected together, or can it be separated into many parts? Does it have any holes or cavities in it? It turns out that these types of properties allow us to design very powerful and flexible methods to distinguish between objects in space and to analyze high dimensional data sets. Many of these methods rely on the extraction of content descriptors capturing global and qualitative properties of the objects and the  data sets. In each case, the goal remains to extract features that enhance our understanding of the shapes of objects and the measured data and allow us to represent them in structures that are easy to manipulate for subsequent processing.

      The main objective of this proposal is to utilize a combination of a theory from topology and the power of computing to solve problems in imaging and other fields where analysis of data sets is a key issue.  We will develop topological and algorithmic tools that allow automatic identification, location, and classification of qualitative features of data sets, such as the presence of corners, edges, peaks, pits, passes, and ridge and ravine lines, and their higher dimensional analogues. Once these features are extracted, different techniques are used to analyze relationships between them and represent their configuration in structures such as graphs which allow us to handle this information in an abstract way. We also aim at developing efficient topological shape descriptors for the representation of three-dimensional objects. 3D models are used in the design of objects and components, and are archived to enable reuse and rapid prototyping of new products. The World Wide Web enables access freely or commercially to these digital archives. Thus, it becomes imperative to develop efficient methods for comparison and matching of 3D shapes to enable automatic 3D shape retrieval.

"L'extraction de caract�ristiques dans des images et des vid�os est une op�ration de base pour plusieurs applications, telles que la recherche d'images et de vid�os bas�e sur le contenu, la surveillance vid�o, la reconnaissance d'objets, la reconstruction 3D, etc. Un des probl�mes majeurs pour ces applications est la d�finition de caract�ristiques pertinentes, pouvant d�crire un sens s�mantique tel que d�fini par l'utilisateur (le syst�me de vision humain) ou le besoin de l'application. Par exemple, l'extraction d'objets dans une image ou une vid�o requiert une telle description de la s�mantique. Il est alors capital d'�laborer des m�canismes de description, d'apprentissage et d'utilisation de l'information s�mantique dans l'extraction des caract�ristiques pertinentes.  



Dans cette perspective, nous proposons un projet de recherche en analyse d'images et de vid�os qui aborde les probl�mes de segmentation d'objets d'int�r�t et d'analyse et reconnaissance d'�v�nements en vid�os. Les deux probl�mes sont reli�s dans le sens o� ils requi�rent l'extraction de caract�ristiques pertinentes, d�crivant le sens s�mantique, sur lesquelles se baseront des applications de haut niveau. Pour la segmentation d'objets, le probl�me est d'extraire des structures dans une image repr�sentant des objets d'int�r�t (une personne, une voiture, etc.). Pour l'analyse et la reconnaissance d'�v�nements en vid�o, le probl�me est de d�finir des caract�ristiques d�crivant les �v�nements dans une s�quence vid�o.

"A defining characteristic of life is movement. From our ability to walk down the street, to the distribution of individual molecules within our cells, movement is a basic necessity and tiny protein machines known as ""motor proteins"" power most forms of it. One of the best-known families of motor proteins are kinesins. These motors convert the energy released from breaking chemical bonds in high-energy molecules like ATP into mechanical force in order to move along protein tracks in cells. In the process, they transport various cargoes to their required destinations in the cell. Recent efforts in nanotechnology development have focused on kinesins and other motor proteins as a source of inspiration for building and powering nanoscale devices. A major goal of Dr. Allingham's research is to understand the aspects of kinesin motor design that confer their motile properties in order to facilitate rapid development in this area. The specific focus of studies currently underway in Dr. Allingham's laboratory involve deciphering the mechanism by which novel forms of kinesin from a variety of different organisms are able to coordinate the conversion of chemical energy into controlled movement. By determining the three-dimensional structures of these kinesins, observing their movement, and studying the effects of mutations on these parameters, Dr. Allingham's group hopes to gain insight into this mechanism, which could revolutionize our understanding of how motors carry out their various vital functions in cells and how these functions are regulated at different times and in different cell types. Such studies will also provide opportunities for graduate students to obtain multidisciplinary training in advanced research methods and allow them to make significant contributions to our understanding fundamental scientific questions.

"A long history of research in the field of Visual Ecology has attempted to understand the evolution of fish vision by comparing fish that live in different environments, or by testing visual system efficiencies with varied backgrounds/stimuli. Here we focus instead on testing hypotheses regarding the adaptive value of characters by altering retinal features through gene knockout, knockdown, mis-expression and transgenesis in zebrafish. We will modify the sensitivity and patterns of photoreceptors in zebrafish and their close relatives. The engineered fish will be tested in paradigms of visual system physiology and behaviour to define their visual abilities. Thus we will integrate data of developmental mechanisms/morphology with recordings of visual sensitivity and acuity. This overall approach will be used to investigate: 

1) the advantages of losing UV-sensitive cone photoreceptors during development & evolution, i.e. measuring visual function of the remaining cones after cone-specific ablation in innovative transgenic zebrafish; 

2) the diversity of visual pigments, especially long wavelength sensitivity in sexual selection of guppies and fish closely related to zebrafish; 

3) the adaptive value of photoreceptor mosaics (elaborate patterns of cones), including disrupting mosaics to test their putative roles in polarization sensitivity and detection of moving stimuli. 

        To date only gross manipulations of the receptor, i.e. the cells and organs that are evolving, have been pragmatic (e.g. through placement of filters, ablation of organs, or disruptions of endocrinology). Thus it is a great innovation to precisely alter the visual sensitivity of a vertebrate, in a manner designed to directly test outstanding hypotheses of visual system evolution. Furthermore, my approach represents an ambitious attempt to investigate how development has shaped visual system evolution. Conclusions reached herein will also have substantial influence on interpreting mammalian visual system evolution, including the repeated loss of UV sensitivity in marine mammals, and LWS opsin gene duplications in primates.

"Dysfunction of the basal ganglia (BG) is associated with many impairments of movement, yet we still do not fully understand how this set of brain structures specifically contributes to control of limb movements.  Researchers tend to isolate arm movements or leg movements as a specific output modality, without recognizing the potential for the different limb systems to be influenced by a common neural mechanism.  The purpose of this research is to determine what underlying process the BG may be responsible for, that lead to the motor impairments and symptoms that are observable in diseased states.  



One potential hypothesis (supported by our previous research) is that this region of the brain may be involved in processing sensory feedback from the limbs in order to formulate a perception of self-motion.  The ability to formulate this type of self-based frame of reference may be critical to the quality and accuracy of movement, in addition to how we are able to interact with our environment.  The focus of this research program is to isolate sensory sources of feedback during various upper and lower limb tasks and evaluate how this influences movement in healthy participants compared to those whose basal ganglia may be dysfunctional.  If the BG are responsible for guiding planned movements through the integration of proprioception with distance or timing relevant cues in our environment, then differences between participants with BG-damage and healthy controls will be identified (as in our preliminary studies). This important concept will enhance our current understanding of brain function and significantly contribute to our identification of an underlying cause of many of the movement impairments observed in basal ganglia-disordered populations.

"The requested support from the proposed NSERC RTI application will be used to purchase a high speed, high resolution, digital camera. This device will be used extensively in the research program currently supported by the applicant's NSERC Discovery Grant to study novel energy dissipation structures. Additionally, this equipment will also be used by the co-applicants investigating materials deformation at elevated strain rates and response of structures under high speed testing conditions.  The high speed camera will also be used in biomechanical analyses.  Practical engineering structures which will be analyzed with this system include, but are not limited to, foam filled braided tubes and aluminum extrusions subjected to cutting deformation.  Biomechanical analyses will include, but are not limited to, the quantification of soft tissue motion relative to bone and the documentation of shockwave propagation through the upper and lower extremities under impact conditions.  The motion analysis software would be used to appropriately quantify photographic observations in the large range of applications which the camera will be utilized.



The above mentioned studies, which will involve the use of the high speed camera and motion analysis software, have the potential to significantly impact a number of practical applications.  These include, but are not limited to, automotive, military, aerospace, personal safety protection, and running/walking applications. The most significant aspect of the use of these research tools will be to reduce the severity of injuries or potential of death as a result of falls, automotive crashes, pedestrian impacts, blasts, or bomb explosions. Additionally, these research tools will also aid in reducing running induced joint and muscle injuries.  The high speed camera system and the requested software would be used extensively during the training of highly qualified personnel. Thus, the proposed camera system would act as a tool for research and education and also serve as a device to develop knowledge.

"The applicant will investigate, through theoretical, experimental and numerical methods, the development of novel energy dissipation structures.  An emphasis on experimental investigations will occur.  The novel energy dissipation devices include foam filled braided tubes and cutting deformation of lightweight aluminum and high strength steel extrusions.  Foam filled braided tubes could be utilized in applications which would require energy dissipation as a result of tensile loading while extrusion cutting deformation is applicable to compressive loading.  These devices may be used in a broad range of applications, which may include automotive, military, aerospace, and personal safety protection device industries.  A novel aspect of these devices is the capability of tuning the load/displacement response for specific applications.  Hence, use in a very wide range of industries is possible.  The most significant aspect of the application of these devices will be to reduce the severity of injuries or potential of death as a result of falls, automotive crashes, pedestrian impacts, blasts, or bomb explosions.



Experimental studies will be conducted in both quasi-static and dynamic conditions and students will be utilizing state of the art equipment to quantify the deformation characteristics of the energy absorbers through use of an optical strain measurement device.  Numerical models will also be developed utilizing traditional Lagrangian finite element formulations as well as Eulerian and mesh free methods.  Theoretical models to predict load/displacement and energy dissipation will also be developed.  Support from the proposed research grant will provide assistance to train highly qualified personnel and conduct research in the development of these energy dissipation devices.

"The goal of the Network is the development of the worlds most advanced Virtual Machining Technology (VMT) for both macro and micro machining operations. This VMT will comprise a complete set of modeling and analysis tools for the planning of optimal machining operations in a virtual environment. It will enable the economical manufacture of innovative products without first resorting to costly physical trials. A key element to validating the effectiveness of this technology will be its application on a new state-of-the-art 5-axis meso-scale milling machine, to be developed within the mandate of the proposed Network. 

The Network will include the premier and most active Canadian researchers in the manufacturing field, with proven track records in their respective disciplines  20 Professors from 7 Universities in Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec. The team is well balanced  it includes 11 full Professors, 4 Associate Professors, and 5 Assistant Professors. This group of experienced senior and very energetic and talented young scientists is certainly capable of creating the necessary tools for achieving the worlds first comprehensive VMT, and the new 5-axis robotic meso-scale milling machine.

An effective Virtual Machining Technology requires the formulation and seamless integration of a large number of rigorous mathematical models describing all the individual steps in a production chain, thus, the main Themes of our Network. Steps to be modeled include material behaviour at the microstructure level, tribology of the tool and workpiece, cutting-process dynamics, positioning errors and imperfections in the calibration of the machine-tool, and processing of part-geometry data. When these steps are modeled accurately and simulated with precision, profitable machining strategies can be achieved and new products and machines developed rapidly, innovatively, and in an environmentally-friendly manner. Significantly, meso-machines, due to their smaller scale, require fewer resources to produce, have a significantly smaller footprint, and require less energy to operate compared to todays standard macro-scale counterparts. They are also environmentally friendlier for the manufacture of smaller-sized parts, and provide a new paradigm for the advanced manufacturing of precision complex-geometry parts with micro-scale features. 

The Networks primary deliverables will be the proposed (i) VMT that will include numerous easy-to-use software tools readily integrable into commercial CAD/CAM systems, and (ii) new 5-axis meso-milling machine. We expect that all our developed technologies will be commercialized by Canadian companies (see support letters). About 100 additional  new engineers will also be graduating from our labs over the next five years ( funded through this Network), who will facilitate the transfer of the results of our work to the Canadian aerospace, automotive, power generation, die & mold, and automation-systems-manufacturing industries in an efficient manner.

"Previous works from my laboratory have confirmed the feasibility of producing protein hydrolysates that contain low-molecular weight (<1 kDa) calmodulin (CaM)-binding peptides through enzymatic hydrolysis of pea and flaxseed proteins. Due to their small size, the peptides have a high potential to be absorbed intact into the blood circulatory system; in vitro tests confirmed resistance to gastrointestinal digestive enzymes. The protein hydrolysates were shown to inhibit the activities of CaM-dependent metabolic enzymes such as protein kinase II (CaMKII) and nitric oxide synthases (NOS) that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. The proposed research will use the protein hydrolysates as the raw materials to isolate and identify the structural characteristics of potent CaM-binding peptides. Peptides will be purified from the protein hydrolysates using ion-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography methods. Amino acid sequence of peptides will be determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. In vitro tests will determine inhibitor (peptide) concentration that reduces enzyme (CaMKII, NOS, and phosphodiesterase) activity by 50% (IC50). The relationships between IC50 and amino acid sequence of peptides will be determined using partial least square regression modeling to provide new information on structure-function properties and locate potent peptide sequences within food proteins. Animal feeding experiments will determine the potential physiological benefits of the peptides. Results from these experiments will identify peptides that can be used to formulate therapeutic products against chronic diseases and provide technical support for the Canadian health and food industries. Information from structure-function studies will provide scientists with a platform for future design of more powerful therapeutic peptides or peptidomimetics. The proposed work will lead to the training of highly qualified personnel with interdisciplinary skills in Food Science and the Life Sciences.

"a) Pathway analysis of microarray data. 



The statistical analysis of microarray data can potentially provide vital information for flagging genes that play important biological roles in the development of a complex disease. In this research, we plan to incorporate the biology at the initial stage by focusing on pathways or functional enrichment of microarray data as a way to take into account meaningful groupings of genes. An analysis of pathways can help to identify subtle changes in the expression of a group of genes for which the biological interpretation is more apparent. The approach being proposed is entirely nonparametric in nature and takes into account correlations which naturally exist among genes. 



b) The comparison of two groups having an umbrella ordering. 



In a recent article, a general method was developed and evaluated for constructing nonparametric tests of hypotheses for ""umbrella alternatives"". Such alternatives arise in situations where the treatment effect changes in direction after reaching a peak. In the present research, we compare two populations which exhibit an umbrella ordering and develop in part a test of the hypothesis that they have the same peak, whether or not its location is known. 



c) Nonparametric classification problems based on the ranks of the data. 

In this research, we treat the well-known classification problem involving two or more populations but propose to use only the ranks of the data.

"The continuous advancement of material science and engineering along with the increasing demand for improved design, safety and energy efficiency requirements necessitates the establishment and verification of new nonlinear theories to describe the interaction between thin-walled structures and the surrounding fluid. The proposed research considers the study of nonlinear vibrations and dynamic stability of thin-walled structures with fluid-structure interaction. Thin shells, plates and curved panels (with single or double curvature) of traditional, laminated composite and functionally graded materials can be found in many engineering applications e.g. in aircraft, spacecraft, rockets, cars, computer disks (CD), DVD, hard-disks, submarines, boats, storage tanks and roof of buildings. Shell structures are also part of many biological systems such as the pulmonary passage and veins found in the human body. The objective of the research is twofold: (i) to develop a study approaching open problems with ground-breaking innovations in experimental, theoretical and numerical investigation, and (ii) to use an unifying approach to merge branches of research that have proceeded separately in the past but that present many common problems. This research also aims to improve existing theoretical models for the nonlinear mechanics of shells, e.g. by constructing a new consistent nonlinear shell theory including third-order shear deformation and rotary inertia, which is particularly important for advanced materials. The nonlinear analysis will be (i) performed numerically, by developing innovative numerical codes based on reduced-order models and, (ii) experimentally, by developing a sophisticated measuring system and procedure, including a laser Doppler vibrometer used on specimens placed in water and wind tunnels, in order to validate the numerical codes, study the complex dynamics and evaluate the effect of geometric imperfections. Specifically, the experimental procedure will also involve (a) experimental modal analysis with burst random or impact excitation; and (b) identification of the nonlinear response using feedback controlled step-sine excitation, altering the excitation frequency to induce hysteresis and jumps.

"This proposal focuses on the development of three frameworks to improve both the development process of optimizing compilers and the performance of the code produced by such compilers. We will develop a machine-learning framework to discover method-specific compilation strategies from a set of method features. The first development will target just-in-time compilation in the IBM Testarossa Compiler. We are also developing a data-mining framework to enable the discovery of frequent code patterns in profiling data and thus to help developers to identify potential improvements to code generation. The first data-mining framework will also work on the IBM Testarossa Compiler. Finally, we will develop a framework for statistical profiling that will be able to combine profiles from several executions of a program and provide the compiler with meaningful statistics on the variability of the behavior of the application. The first implementation of this framework will be in the IBM XL compilers.



Past studies have indicated that optimizing compilers contribute up to 40% of the increase in performance observed when new processors are delivered. This research will develop technologies that will produce faster compilers that generate more efficient code, thus improving a key tool for the success of the Canadian software industry. The target of the code generation is both enterprise software and servers and desktop computing. Both are key technology for internet-base commerce and information exchange. The access to IBM software platform makes it possible for Canadian students to test their ideas in state-of-the-art technology. The publication of the results will benefit companies that rely on compiler technology across Canada.

"Video is becoming increasingly used in applications as diverse as entertainment, security, education, medicine, and even wireless devices. The introduction of video over mobile devices will accelerate this trend. For example, statistics Canada revealed that Canadians spent 21.6 hours per week watching TV in 2002, and security studies show that security concerns of government agencies, enterprises and individuals are driving the video surveillance market to a constant and robust expansion to be sustained for decades. A fundamental task in all these applications is the extraction of dynamic video content such as moving objects and their features. Video content is subject to different interpretation and video  description can vary according to observers and applications. Video usually includes multiple objects, occlusion, and artifacts. The stable extraction of video content in real-world applications is, therefore, a challenging task. 

In projects from previous funding, we have investigated real-time stable solutions to the problem of extracting multiple moving objects and features from signals of fixed video camera. We also integrated our solutions in a real-time video surveillance system and tested their individual integration into hardware (FPGA). 

In this proposal, we will focus on extraction of video content using advanced methods to handle video acquired by a moving camera and variable background. These solutions will use advanced tools, such as wavelet transform or MPEG-7, and be based on multi-levels: video  enhancement to estimate and reduce image noise, video stabilization to compensate for camera motion and changing background, and video analysis to extract moving objects and their features. Expected techniques will be integrated into an advanced (next-generation) video surveillance system. We aim also to implement the multi-level processing on one FPGA. Expected solutions would facilitate and advance the use of video in two intended video applications: in video  surveillance (such as to detect events) and in TV systems (such as to convert between video formats).

"Nature provides examples of surface engineering in Lotus leaves that are self-cleaning when rain drops roll on these leaves. This amazing self-cleaning property is due to surface topography, chemistry and drop motion. Understanding the physics of drop motion on solid surfaces and what can facilitate or hinder this motion at early stages of movement along with how and what can be done to a surface chemically or topographically to manipulate drop movement are the subjects of this proposal. The implications of understanding above issues is not only of academic interest, but also of industrial applications; e.g., engineered surfaces for fuel cell can allow drop shedding in channels to avoid their flooding resulting in enhanced efficiency, or condensers that operate in drop-wise rather than film condensation mode, which will have much improved performance.

             To develop tools to manipulate surface chemistry, we will further advance the direct laser patterning (DLP) technique for alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer surfaces. DLP will be used to produce surfaces with chemical gradients by modulation of laser power during scanning of the beam. We will also study the fundamentals of DLP, e.g. scaling of the pattern feature sizes with velocity of the scanning beam, and extension of DLP to alkylsilanes on silicon. Hot embossing will be used to engineer desirable surface topographies, e.g. hierarchical micro/nano-textured surfaces seen in Lotus leaves. The precise control of surface texture afforded by the novel approach of hot embossing allows us, to thermodynamically using free energy analysis, study apparent contact angle and contact angle hysteresis for textured surfaces. The incipient motion of drops subjected to an airflow for drops of various size and intrinsic contact angles on homogenous, and on textured or pattered surfaces with chemical gradients will be studied.

"Nature provides examples of surface engineering in Lotus leaves that are self-cleaning when rain drops roll on these leaves. This amazing self-cleaning property is due to surface topography, chemistry and drop motion. Understanding the physics of drop motion on solid surfaces and what can facilitate or hinder this motion at early stages of movement along with how and what can be done to a surface chemically or topographically to manipulate drop movement are the subjects of this proposal. The implications of understanding above issues is not only of academic interest, but also of industrial applications; e.g., engineered surfaces for fuel cell can allow drop shedding in channels to avoid their flooding resulting in enhanced efficiency, or condensers that operate in drop-wise rather than film condensation mode, which will have much improved performance.

             To develop tools to manipulate surface chemistry, we will further advance the direct laser patterning (DLP) technique for alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer surfaces. DLP will be used to produce surfaces with chemical gradients by modulation of laser power during scanning of the beam. We will also study the fundamentals of DLP, e.g. scaling of the pattern feature sizes with velocity of the scanning beam, and extension of DLP to alkylsilanes on silicon.

"State of the art IT devices, such as semiconductor electronics, optoelectronics and data storage media, include components with dimensions in the nanometres, and are subject to intense and very brief heating pulses of picoseconds.  Further advances in data storage densities, transistor and transmission speeds are strongly limited by issues related to heat transfer.  These issues have only recently emerged as a consequence of increased densities and miniaturization of the device features into the nanometres. In the presence of hotspots and in thin metallic media, and in the nanoscale regime, the continuum Fourier assumption fails and the contributions of both phonons and electrons to heat transfer can no longer be neglected. To predict the thermal behaviour at all relevant scales, one needs to take into account device components with spatial dimensions from nanometres to centimetres and temporal scales from picoseconds to hours. 

 The objectives of this research program are to: (i) develop a robust approach for understanding thermal phenomena in nanoscale engineered devices; this includes phonon transport accounting for the effects of phonon confinement, dispersion, polarization and relaxation times;  (ii) develop the fundamental concept, theoretical framework, and implementation of a hierarchical computational methodology capable of integrating all scales represented by Fourier diffusion, Boltzmann Transport Equations (BTE), Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD)simulations; and, (iii) apply such methodology for thermal prediction where phonons are the main energy carrier in data storage and electronics devices, and other nano-macro structures including nanowires and quantum dot systems.

 The findings of this proposed research will also advance the understanding of phonon and photon transport,  and phonon-electron interactions, providing the ability to tailor transport properties at the nanoscale to achieve novel materials and devices with given transport characteristics at the macroscale, with application to low-dimensional thermoelectrics and silicon solar cells.

"Contamination of drinking water supplies is an important issue facing today's societies. One common contaminant is petroleum products, such as crude oil and gasoline that can be spilled during transportation and storage. When these products are spilled on the land surface they can leach into groundwater. 

     A fortunate characteristic of many petroleum products is that they will biodegrade in the subsurface due to the presence of naturally occurring bacteria. This process is termed monitored natural attenuation (MNA) and has become an accepted means of remediating contaminated sites. An important aspect of MNA is that it must be proven that the contaminants are degrading and that they are not posing a risk to the public or the environment. Petroleum products are lighter than water so that when they are spilled on the ground or in the shallow subsurface, they will tend to float on the water table. A portion of the petroleum will dissolve into the groundwater where it will be transported by groundwater  flow, and potentially biodegrade. Near the water table several processes are occurring; fluctuations in water table elevation, recharge of rain water, and entrapment of air bubbles. Gas bubble entrapment occurs when the water table rises and traps air within the sediment grains. Each of these processes will aid in the transport of oxygen into the groundwater, which will tend to accelerate biodegradation. 

     This research will involve laboratory experiments, field experiments and numerical modeling studies aimed at measuring oxygen transport from each of these processes, with an emphasis on the entrapment of air bubbles, which has not been well studied previously. The research will facilitate better predictions of the rate and extent of petroleum biodegradation, allowing for better assessments of where and when MNA is appropriate. This research will also seek to develop methods for enhancing oxygen transport through air bubble entrapment to provide improved remediation strategies where MNA is not efficient.

"This proposal is an extension of previous work in my research group on the development of biodegradable elastomers for protein drug delivery.  The elastomers prepared to date consist of star copolymers of e-caprolactone and D,L-lactide or trimethylene carbonate, end-terminated with acrylate groups.  These prepolymers are photocrosslinked to form hydrolyzable elastomers of tuneable degradation rates and mechanical properties.  The elastomers have been demonstrated to be biocompatible and are presently being assessed by a number of biomedical companies. We are interested in exploring the possibility of using these elastomers as polymer scaffolds for engineering soft tissues. Tissue engineering involves the preparation of a biomaterial scaffold onto which the appropriate cells are seeded and grown to generate a new tissue. With the demand of replacement tissues far exceeding donor supply, tissue engineering to replace lost or damaged tissue is a promising technological advance.  The elastomers prepared in my research group have the advantage of possessing mechanical properties similar to those of soft tissues such as blood vessels, articular cartilage and ligaments, a necessary attribute as it has been established that mechanical stimulation is necessary in order to regenerate functional replacement tissue. The backbone of these elastomers, however, contain no functional chemical groups to which ligands such as proteins or carbohydrates can be bound or to which cells can respond or attach.  The objectives of this proposal, therefore, are to prepare photocrosslinkable elastomers that are biodegradable and which possess functional groups such as ketones, hydroxyls, or carboxylic acids along their backbone, to assess their mechanical and chemical properties, to determine cellular responses to them, and to generate various tissue engineering scaffolds from them. This project will train 2 PhD candidates and 4 summer students in the development and characterization of novel polymer biomaterials.

"We are developing an innovative technique to treat osteoarthritis, the debilitating condition wherein loss of mobility results from degeneration of the cartilage in th joint. Currently, there are few surgical approaches available for the repair of these focal cartilage lesions. One of the most widely used of these techniques is autologous osteochondral grafting in which donor cartilage-bone grafts are removed from the non-weight-bearing sites of the joint and placed in a prepared defect site. Even though this is a fairly simple procedure that has been used for almost a decade, one drawback is the lack of cartilage integration between the transplanted grafts as well as between the grafts and the host tissue at the periphery of the defect. Thus, it is the

objective of this proposal to promote cartilage integration through the controlled release of growth factors directly at the graft-host and graft-graft interfaces. The technique involves the delivery of protein therapeutics at the site of a tissue transplantation in the joint space. The protein therapeutics will be chosen so as to encourage migration of articular cartilage cells in the afflicted region at the periphery of the transplant site into the interface region. Once in this region, the cartilage cells will grow and produce cartilag tissue. In this manner better integration of the transplant with the surrounding healthy tissue will be achieved. The project has

the potential to improve the quality of life of numerous Canadians suffering from joint pain and disability arising from arthritic conditions. This project will be conducted by 1 PhD candidate and 1 Post-Doctoral Fellow, who will gain both research and clinical experience within a multi-disciplinary team consisting of biomedical engineers and surgeons. The project brings together researchers at two universities, Guelph and Queen's, to work together to design an effective treatment for osteoarthritis.","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel",2,"CHRPJ ","Collaborative Health Research Projects",Ontario,Ontario

"Partial differential equations provide a mathematical representation  of the relationship between the temporal and spatial variation of  an unknown function or set of functions. Such equations arise in a natural way in numerous settings including fluid motion, chemical reactions, developmental biology, and spatial ecology. In general such equations involve nonlinear effects corresponding to, for example, underlying  saturation effects and interactions between model components. Such effects while making the models more realistic, also make the solution of such equations much more challenging and indeed exact closed form solutions are typically not accessible except in certain idealized circumstances. Therefore alternative methodologies based on approximation and analysis of qualitative features in certain limiting circumstances become essential in understanding the nature of the models, their solutions and  in turn the underlying physical system. Within this context, this proposal considers two classes of nonlinear partial differential equations and the analytic and computational methodologies used to study them. First I intend to continue an ongoing study of resonant solutions of nonlinear wave equations which underly waves in shallow fluids such as atmospheric flows over topography. The key goals involve both the study of solutions in generalized circumstances, as well as the development of the analytic methodology which in turn may be applicable to a wider range of problems. Second is the study of a widely applicable and increasingly prevalent class of equations which arise in the context of chemical and biological applications involving the combination of diffusive and reaction processes. The focus of this aspect of the study will be to study in general the robustness of certain solution features such as pattern formation, waves and long time behaviour under the influence of perturbative effects. In addition with the growing complexity of the models, numerical approximation of solutions is becoming an increasingly crucial analytic tool. As such this study will also investigate and develop more efficient computational methodologies suited for models of this type.

"Many Canadian hospitals are developing data warehouses (DW) that integrate clinical and administrative data with multiple sources to support decision makers and researchers in improving the effectiveness of health services. Decision support systems (DSS) can be used to monitor hospital processes related to antibiotics utilization* patient discharge, and adverse events, and enable appropriate action. However, providing consistent, timely and secure access to decision support in a systematic manner to address hospital quality control is not well understood. Compliance with privacy legislation, hospital policies, and ethics rules is problematic and integration into existing business processes is complex.  The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve hospital quality control by developing methodologies, with tool support, for securely delivering the right performance management analyses, reports and data to the right clinicians' health researchers and administrators in a comprehensive fashion throughout hospital business processes. Our approach will combine research in clinical decision support, hospital quality protocols* data warehousing, business process modeling, privacy and secure data delivery in a novel way that addresses these issues up front and investigates how best to integrate this combination into day-to-day hospital operations at the point of care. We will evaluate our research against different healthcare business processes in, at least two different hospitals in two different provinces.  These contributions will not only have a direct impact on tbe.hospitals involved but also on other healthcare faciitties across Canada that are developing new DWs. End users will more easily access relevant performance and clinical information to Improve quality of care, and IT personnel will take advantage of our tools and methodologies to implement secure data delivery infrastmcture.

"Software requirements engineering focuses on the elicitation, analysis, specification, validation, and management of software requirements. Goal-oriented and scenario-oriented modelling techniques have shown to be particularly well suited for the discovery and analysis of requirements. The User Requirements Notation (URN) integrates two complementary visual languages: the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL) for business goals, non-functional requirements, alternatives, decisions and rationales, and the Use Case Maps (UCMs) scenario notation for causal flows of behavior superimposed on architectural components. Various links between these two views are also supported in URN. In the past year, URN started being extended with a new way of composing goals and scenarios based on the concept of ""aspects"", leading to AoGRL and AoUCM. Aspects enable modellers to better encapsulate crosscutting concerns leading to improved modularity, reusability, scalability, and maintainability of models. 

     This research aims to define and validate a tool-supported methodology for requirements engineering based on an integrated aspect-oriented URN (AoURN). The main objectives and tasks include: Determine how best to combine goals and scenarios in single aspects; Enhance requirements analysis, management, and visualization techniques available for URN to take advantage of aspects; Clarify URN semantics and explore semantic-based poincut matching; Evaluate static properties of models in the presence of aspects; Evaluate AoURN in multiple application domains, including business process modelling, architecture evaluations, feature interactions, performance engineering, adaptive agent-based systems, and software product lines; Contribute results to standardization activities related to URN.

     AoURN is the first requirements modelling technique that combines goals, scenarios, and aspects. This work will provide a testbed for global research and experimentation on early aspects. The resulting methodology promises to significantly improve how we develop complex software systems.

"Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant that remains the main cause of governmental advisories related to fish consumption in North America.

I propose a research program that will tackle some critical gaps of knowledge in this sequence of events, through a combination of laboratory and field studies, in temperate and northern environments. Part of my program aims at clarifying the very complex behavior of Hg at air/water and air/snow interfaces, with emphasis on environmental photochemistry. The most pressing question regarding Hg photochemical behavior now regards the photodemethylation process, which is thought to be very significant in whole-ecosystem Hg budgets, but has received very little attention. My program will also consider the impact of redox Hg transformations on the bioavailability of Hg towards microorganisms. Up to now, no one has made a link between the formation of Hg(0) and Hg bioavailability towards methylation under field conditions, although Hg(0) is known to cross prokaryotic membranes. The current paradigm states that bioavailable Hg species are mostly neutral complexes with Hg(II). I want to investigate the possibility that redox processes are involved in the regulation Hg bioavailability in aquatic systems. My long term program also aims at establishing the role of biogenic thiols in Hg (and metal) cycling. Biogenic thiols are emerging as very important in controlling metal speciation and bioavailability in the ocean, but only one study exists on freshwaters. The long term objectives of my proposal are therefore: 1) to assess the importance of Hg photodemethylation in aquatic systems and explore its link to photoredox reactions; 2) to link Hg redox chemistry to Hg bioavailability; 3) to assess the role of biogenic thiols in Hg redox chemistry and bioavailability.

"Accidental loss can occur in four main areas: people, property (or assets), process (or production), and environment. The control of such loss is critical to the uninterrupted operation of businesses and government organizations. By recognizing these facts, managers can place themselves in a better position to both prevent accidents and deal with their consequences. Risk reduction measures aimed at prevention and mitigation can be put in place to deal with hazards such as gas, dust and hybrid mixture explosions. These measures consist of appropriate inherent, engineered (passive and active), and procedural considerations. Risk reduction measures, when ordered as in the previous sentence, form a hierarchy of controls ranging from most to least effective.



My research program aims to address these issues of industrial safety through a combination of careful experimentation, modeling, and analytical tool development. Simply put, the long-term goal of my research program is to provide rigorous, validated engineering methodologies for the enhancement of industrial safety. The primary motivation in my work is the protection of the most important element of any business - people.



The research proposed in this grant application is grouped under four themes; three correspond to the hierarchy levels of inherent safety, engineered safety and procedural safety, with the fourth addressing an overall framework linking these hierarchical risk reduction measures. Focus on the hierarchy of controls means that the research is aimed at the elimination or avoidance of industrial hazards in the first instance, with residual risk management being accomplished through engineered and procedural means. The research outcomes include experimental data with corresponding model predictions, as well as analytical tools for process design modification and safety measure design.

"The long term goal of this research project is to simplify the programming and management of distributed and parallel computer systems. As computer systems become more powerful, due to their larger scale and escalating hardware complexity, it is becoming harder for humans to maintain them and to effectively exploit their plentiful resources in software. The future seems to hold increasing dependence on expensive teams of expert programmers and administrators. This is a critical problem for industry and academia alike. Highly qualified programmers and system administrators simply take longer to produce than more complex and more plentiful hardware. This proposal has two thrusts that address these challenges by facilitating: i) automated computer system management through a set of adaptive system mechanisms that address performance bottlenecks and repair faults automatically and transparently to the user and ii) simpler application programming in distributed and parallel environments through the use of a new programming paradigm called ""Transactional Memory"". Although both project directions have wide applicability, we will explore the application of the proposed techniques in a specific complex class of distributed systems, that of large-scale Internet systems that generate content on-the-fly, called dynamic content servers. Dynamic content servers providing modern information services, e.g., Amazon.com and EBay.com, are built by composing a variety of software systems that interact within a networked environment to provide the service. For example, electronic commerce systems typically consist of multiple tiers, such as, database servers, application servers, and web servers. Organizations currently spend much time and effort on managing information services, with no guarantee of success. This project will provide automatic capabilities for reconfiguration, tuning, automatic code parallelization and seamless failure recovery in networked information services, which will make it easier for organizations that rely on these services to deploy and manage them.","Syst�mes d'information et technologie de l'information","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computing and Information Sciences - A",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"With the recent advances in hardware and software, data streams have become ubiquitous as many sources produce data continuously and rapidly. Mining data streams is to extract knowledge structures or patterns in a non-stopping stream of data. Such patterns can be used for effectively monitoring, analyzing and predicting the changes in the application environment where the data stream is collected. Over the past few years, models and techniques have been proposed to extract patterns from data streams. However, many open issues still remain in data stream mining. 

    The main objective of the proposed research program is to provide solutions to the open issues in data stream mining and develop a resource-adaptive framework for learning classification rules from data streams. We will work on the following issues. An efficient data structure will be designed that aggregates the data on the fly by making trade-offs between memory consumption and accuracy according to resource conditions. We will develop anytime rule learning and classification algorithms that can produce a best possible answer according to the real-time constraints. We will also systematically investigate the types of concept drifts and develop methods for detecting and handling different types of concepts drifts. In addition, we will design dynamic online discretization methods for use with rule learning from data streams. 

    Mining data streams is still in its infancy state. The proposed research program will advance the field by providing solutions to its open challenges. Although we focus on classification rule learning in this research, the proposed data structure and algorithms can be adapted for use in other data stream mining tasks. With the growing proliferation of handheld devices, mobile phones, wearable computers and tablets, it becomes ever more important to develop online resource-adaptive data mining systems to assist people in decision making. The techniques developed in this research program will have a wide range of applications in areas such as networking, telecomminucations, scientific experiments, finance and medicine.

"Computer simulations are important for both basic science and product/process simulations.  The breadth and power of these simulations have grown significantly as processor power has increased in a predictable fashion over more than a decade.  But in the last several years, growth has shifted from clock-speed increases to increases in computational width as the result of design changes forced on chip designers by basic physics.  Width means parallelism, either within an instruction stream (SIMD) or across multiple cores, and frequently in combination.



Developing software for these new architectures is challenging because in addition to the intrinsic algorithmic difficulties, the parallelism necessary to achieve scalable performance imposes new algorithmic constraints.  The Coconut Project of McMaster University is developing a new generation of user tools to make it easier for programmers to specify explicitly and implicitly parallel algorithms.



The challenges are twofold:  de-couple computation into pieces which can be executed in parallel, and partition the computation into pieces small enough to be addressed efficiently by future processors.



In this Collaborative Research and Development project, we propose to adapt and generalize existing research into the efficient implementation of basic building blocks of scientific computation, to (1) address issues arising from the proliferation of SIMD and multi-core hardware by developing novel scheduling algorithms which incorporate resource restrictions, (2) extend partitioning algorithms designed for linear operations to the multi-linear computations which arise when simulating and identifying complex interacting systems, like networks of metabolites, or partially self-catalysing industrial or environmental reaction-diffusion systems.



To validate the effectiveness of the algorithms we develop, we will generate code for the Cell BE architecture, and the latest pre-production hardware made available to us by IBM Canada.  Our research results will lead to increased capabilities and increased performance for compiler products developed by IBM Canada, following on the significant 4X and 5X performance improvements represented by the MASS libraries for Cell BE generated by Coconut distributed by IBM.



As important as the new ideas we will generate, we will train approximately ten students who will have an even greater impact after they graduate.  They will contribute to the growing capability in compiler technology centered in southern Ontario, which in addition to IBM's major Compiler group includes compiler developers at AMD, RapidMind and Google.

"The results of this research will lead to the better utilization of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) equipment.  This will result in a reduction in scan-time for MRI procedures and improve the quality of the resulting scans.  It will allow more NMR experiments to be conducted in existing labs.  



MRI is used in clinical imaging, medical research and material science.  In dynamic imaging (e.g., imaging a beating heart, or imaging the passage of a contrast agent through the kidney) the longer the experiment, the more moving tissues and blood will be blurred.  By optimizing the collection of MRI data, this research will give physicians the ability to observe processes at higher resolutions, especially in patients with irregular heartbeats and limited ability to remain still, and thereby improve our ability to diagnose disease.  In addition to reducing blurring as a side-effect of faster exam times, the research in this proposal represents the only attempt to incorporate motion-insensitivity into the trajectory used to collect MR raw data.  This is important both when the tissue of interest is in motion (e.g., cardiac imaging) and when static tissue is obscured by errors caused by nearby tissue in motion (so-called motion artifacts).



NMR is the best tool available to study proteins dynamics and thereby determine how they bind to other molecules, but the experiments are very time consuming, including both long experiment times, and the considerable skill required to interpret the ambiguous data.  I have developed a mathematical model to predict the information content of such NMR experiments.  This will allow such experiments to be optimized, dramatically shortening the required experiment time.  This will speed up the process of understanding protein dynamics.

"Research activity in Electrical Engineering is experiencing a paradigm shift in focus, from submicron to nano electronics. This has the potential to revolutionize Electrical Engineering, with the creation of an entirely new class of devices, based on novel materials and device physics. The laws of quantum mechanics will greatly influence the behavior of these nanodevices, which will lead to lower power dissipation per logic operation, and higher functionality per unit volume and weight. Owing to their large surface to volume ratios, nanodevices are also opening up new solid-state technologies for chemical and biological sensing, with unprecedented single molecule sensitivities. It is not clear as to which of the emerging technologies will eventually come to stay. To enable rapid progress, there is a need to design devices with optimal performance. This can be achieved through theory and realistic modeling that accounts for the underlying device physics and properties of nanomaterials. As fabrication of nanodevices and nanomaterials are expensive, we believe that modeling can play a leading role, in isolating the winning nanotechnologies in a cost-efficient manner, and exploring new nanodevice concepts. The overall thrust of the proposed research activities is to build a strong focus in the computational study and design of nanodevices, at the University of Waterloo. This will be materialized by building upon our expertise in modeling nanodevices and nanosensors, based on the equations of quantum physics and atomistic methods.

Lattice structures are ubiquitous: from the regular arrangement of hexagonal cells in the brood of a honey bee to roof trusses and gas turbine blades. They are all characterized by a unit that repeats itself either linearly or cyclically in one, two, or three-dimensions. The notion of micro-architectured metallic truss lattice materials has received wide interest among the mechanics of materials community over the past five years. Central to these efforts is the goal to achieve tailored lattice architectures with high specific stiffness and strength in all metallic and composite structures. Such structures have applications in aerospace and automotive industries. Today, engineers are in a position to 'write' complex three dimensional lattice patterns in a computer which will be translated to a manufactured component, thanks to modern manufacturing techniques such as laser micromachining, micro printing, and soft lithography. This is possible due to the developments in microelectronics industry. 



This research program will study the influence of geometrical pattern of a lattice upon its mechanical properties when subjected to dynamic loads such as an impact. Understanding the mechanical behaviour of innovative lattice structural materials will lead to the development of the next generation multifunctional, stiff and lightweight structures for applications in aerospace and automotive industry, cutting edge applications as mechanical wave filters that can enhance the signal processing capabilities at Micro and Nano scales which can be used in mobile phone communications. Graduate student training is an integral part of the research program. Two M.A.Sc students and one PhD student will be trained on the analysis and innovative multidisciplinary applications of lattice structures. International collaborations will be established.

"Glucosamine (GlcN) is used extensively as an ""over the counter"" preparation for joint and bone disorders. However, it is not clear from clinical trials that it actually works. The main source GlcN is chitosan, which is derived from chitin, the most abundant polymer in the animal kingdom. So GlcN is a ""nutraceutical"". We have developed a series N-acylated glucosamines (GlcNAcyls), which are chemically modified nutriceuticals, for veterinary and human applications, primarily in arthritis and osteoporosis. Our preferred (lead) compound, N-butyryl glucosamine (GlcNBu) has shown positive effects in animal models for these applications, GlcN itself has not. Other applications, for which we have preliminary data, include enhancing animal growth and weight gain and possibly cognition and increased mobility in aged dogs. GlcNBu appears to have very little, if

any, toxicity. Patents for the above applications have been issued in conjunction with the Canadian Arthritis Network, which is a National Centre of Excellence. Initially we will extend our studies on the mammalian applications. We will then study the possible mechanisms of action of GlcNBu and other GlcNAcs to account for the effects we see in animals. We will also investigate biological synthetic approaches, involving an important intermediary compound called butyryl Co-enzyme A, exists in mammals as well as in bacteria and algae. We will focus on the bacteria and common algae, since butyrly Co-enzyme A is known to be important in some types of bacteria and probably algae. Ultimately, we anticipate being able to apply biologic ""green technologies"" for the commercial synthesis of GlcNAcyls, utilizing bacterial or algae factories. Algae would be particularly attractive as they easily grow in water. Production of GlcNAcyls by bacteria or algae could have significant postive effects for the Canadian economy. Canadian supporting organizations include: CanCog (Toronto), Bioniche (Belleville) and Kingfisher International Inc (Stouffville).

"Symmetries, conservation laws, and related analysis of differential equations has attracted a high level of flourishing activity in the last 10 years while also expanding in interesting new directions. At the same time, there has been a surge of work in geometric integrability of partial differential equations, in particular deriving soliton equations, recursion operators, and Hamiltonian structures from flows of curves and surfaces in differential geometry. My research proposal involves several major directions of work in these two areas, with the aim being to solve open problems, address important applications, and produce new results having a wide mathematical impact.

"The objective of the proposed research will be to discover structurally novel marine natural products that can be used as chemical tools in cell biology and whole animal investigations of autophagy, miRNA gene silencing, and toll-like-receptor-5 (TLR5) signaling. Organic synthesis will be used to investigate the SAR of the new pharmacophores, to make biotinylated probes for protein target identification, and provide sufficient material for animal studies. A 'Forward Chemical Genetics' approach that employs cell-based assays to screen chemical libraries for non-toxic small molecule modulators of gene product (protein) function that produce phenotypes of interest will be used to facilitate the discovery of new marine natural product cell biology tools. The biological systems, autophagy, miRNA gene silencing, and toll-like-receptor-5 signaling, have been chosen because: i) they have recently been recognized to play important roles in basic cell biology and human disease (neurodegeneration and cystic fibrosis), ii) all three are incompletely characterized at the genetic and protein level, and iii) there are no small molecule modulators known for two of them and only non-selective modulators available for the third. Marine invertebrates and microorganisms from tropical habitats in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Dominica and from cold water habitats in BC will serve as a rich and relatively unexplored resource of novel chemical diversity for this marine natural products discovery/chemical genetics research. The research will provide new molecular tools to study important biological processes at the genetic and protein level in single cells and animals, help identify new drug targets, and may provide lead compounds for development of drugs for the treatment of neurodegeneration and cystic fibrosis. Discovery of new bioactive natural products adds unique diversity to the pool of known chemical entities, reveals unknown biosynthetic pathways and pharmacophores, and provides attractive targets for synthetic organic chemists, stimulating the development of new synthetic strategies and methodology.

"Attention regulates cognition to enable the control of thought, behavior, and perception. As such, altering the capacity for selective attention may not only have implications for internal conceptual processes but also the allocation of attention to the external environment, shaping the initial process of perceptual encoding, and thereby biasing the contents of perceptual experience.  The objectives of the research program are to examine the behavioral and neural correlates of positive and negative affect on attention, examining whether these behavioral and neural systems represent opposing influences on the scope of attention and thereby thought and action.  We intend to provide behavioral and neural data to examine the thesis that the neural systems of positive affect support a more exploratory mode of attention, whereas negative affect engenders the opposite, a more stereotyped reflexive information processing style.  We also examine how these emotion cognition interactions may be related to individual differences and genetic predispositions in dopamine transmission. This work has important practical and theoretical implications for psychology and neuroscience as it intends to understand the valence specific contributions of emotions to cognition, and their origins in fundamentally different information processing brain states.

"The objective of the proposed research is to experimentally derive a consistent set of thermodynamic properties for transition metal solutes which can be used to predict corrosion product transport and deposition in supercritical water reactors.  To this end, in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) will be used to obtain new data on the stability and structure transition metal species in supercritical water. The XAS data will be combined with solubility measurements obtained by direct x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopic measurements of selected metal oxide-water systems at elevated temperatures. This research seeks to gain a fundamental understanding of the physical and chemical mechanisms at the molecular scale in high temperature water systems. The anticipated results of the project are needed to specify appropriate chemistry control strategies or to develop other methods to mitigate the effects of corrosion product transport in GEN IV supercritical water reactors.

"    )	The goal of my research program is to understand how rare elements, such as tantalum, niobium and lanthanides, exist as dissolved constituents in fluids and melts within the crust of the Earth, and to use this knowledge to more accurately model geochemical processes such as rare element ore formation.  The method proposed consists of two parts: [1] detailed analyses of fluid and melt inclusions (i.e., tiny samples of fluid or melt trapped within minerals), and [2] direct studies of relatively simple experimental fluid and melt systems at geologically relevant temperatures and pressures.  The chemical composition of fluid and melt inclusions collected from major ore deposits will be determined using complementary micro-analytical techniques.  These data will then be used to prepare experimental melt and fluid systems that will be directly analyzed at elevated pressures and temperatures in a diamond window cell, using high brilliance x-rays from a synchrotron light source.  The x-ray emission and absorption spectroscopic data obtained will provide new and important insights into the structure and composition of aqueous fluids coexisting with melts or solid phases.  These data are needed to understand the chemical controls of rare element transport and deposition by hot fluids within the Earth.  The results of this research will enhance our ability to predict where rare elements may concentrate to form ore deposits and improve our ability to interpret chemical fingerprints in rocks that were influenced by hydrothermal (i.e., hot water) processes.  Furthermore, the new methods employed and the data obtained have wider application to solving problems such as industrial boiler corrosion, degradation of toxic wastes, and the confinement of radioactive wastes.","Sciences de la terre","Avancement des connaissances","Solid Earth Sciences",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Nova Scotia","Nouvelle-�cosse"

"The Province of Ontario has recently recognized the critical importance of effective source water protection measures to safeguard public health and environmental health (e.g. the Clean Water Act, which addresses some of the recommendations of the Walkerton Inquiry report). At the same time, it must also be recognized that innovations in wastewater and environmental contaminant treatment systems (for the design and operation of effective, cost efficient and operationally simple enhanced passive systems) are still required, to allow for source water protection in all areas of the province, particularly in the smaller semi-urbanized and rural areas lacking the resources to implement high technology ""urban"" style water and wastewater management infrastructure and processes. In order to be able to propose such innovative enhanced passive systems, a basic scientific and engineering understanding of these systems must first be gained, and this is best done through the long-term operation and assessment of full-scale field demonstration systems.

The proposed research program will build on significant previous successes, in terms of the establishment of a substantial network of field research sites, and their use in the detailed assessment of system and process operation and design in cold-climate settings. Systems to be evaluated include a subsurface flow constructed wetland for the treatment of diffuse landfill leachate (Kingston ON), an innovative near zero-discharge vegetated filter (the Wastewater Garden), for the on-site treatment of domestic wastewater (Portland ON), and an enhanced subsurface wastewater disposal trench process using an innovative filtration medium for improved treatment (Cornwall ON). These processes are representative of the family of passive (operationally and mechanically simple) systems, but they also represent appropriate technologies for source water protection, once we have achieved a thorough understanding of the chemical, physical and biological processes at work through detailed field investigations. This information in turn will allow regulators to make informed decisions about the application of these systems in Ontario and across Canada.

"Ore deposits are concentrations of valuable minerals in the Earth's crust which can be mined for profit. They originate in a variety of ways. One type of deposit is precipitated from aqueous solutions which travel through cracks and tiny holes in the rocks. The reason why these solutions travel through the rocks, their travel paths, and the reasons why they precipitate valuable minerals is the general field of study of this proposal.



Because these events happened in the geological past we cannot see them happening, so we must study the ore deposits (field work), and reconstruct what must have happened using the accepted principles of physics and chemistry (theoretical work). It appears to me from the study of one type of ore deposit, called the Mississippi Valley Type (MVT), that a particular chemical reaction, called thermochemical sulfate reduction, is responsible for the precipitation of the ore minerals. MVT ore deposits are the source of a sizeable fraction of the world's zinc and lead. 



Previous experimental work on this reaction has contributed to our knowledge of what it involves and how fast it proceeds. But the techniques we used have reached the limits of what they are capable of showing. Fortunately a completely new technique which is easier to use, which will provide better data, and is not expensive, has very recently become available. This proposal describes the new technique, the data it can provide, and how this will change our previous ideas about how these ore deposits form.

"We propose to accelerate software programs by automatically implementing the computationally-intensive portions of programs in hardware.  We choose field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) as our target hardware platform.  FPGAs are programmable computer chips that can be configured to implement any digital circuit.  FPGAs excel at implementing computations in parallel and one can think of FPGAs as configurable computers that can be customized for any application.  FPGAs are already a 5 billion dollar market, widely used in the digital hardware industry.  However, being hardware platforms, today's FPGAs can only be used by experienced hardware designers, and as such, their scope and use has been somewhat restricted.  There has recently been a strong push to improve the ease-of-use of FPGAs and expand their user base.  We propose a flow wherein a certain class of software programs, called streaming programs, can be automatically mapped onto an FPGA, speeding program run-time with low development effort and cost.  Streaming programs represent a new paradigm in computation that allow the programmer to efficiently express parallelism within the program -- parallelism that is well-suited for FPGA implementation.  In essence, ""streams"" are collections of independent data elements that can be operated-on in parallel.  Stream computing is particularly useful for describing multimedia applications pervasive in today's digital society, e.g. digital data, video and audio applications. We plan to use an existing streaming programming language, called Brook, which is an extension of the popular C programming language.  We propose to research, design and implement a framework that accepts Brook programs as input and automatically translates them into FPGA hardware.  Evaluation will be done experimentally on a set of sample applications.

"Modern society is in the midst of a digital electronics revolution replete with cell phones, iPods, internet, flat-panel TVs and hand-held computers.  Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are programmable semiconductor chips that are part of that revolution, and poised to be present in every piece of electronic equipment within 10 years.  The rapid growth of FPGAs stems from technology scaling that today allows billions of transistors to fit onto a single chip.  Each advance in technology is tied to rapidly escalating complexity, such that building a custom chip now costs tens of millions of dollars, and is out of reach for all but a few large companies.  FPGAs provide inexpensive access to advanced semiconductor technology, allowing innovation to happen across the spectrum, from small start-ups, to large industry to academia.  

     As they are programmable chips, FPGAs incorporate additional circuitry relative to chips that implement a single fixed function.  A consequence is that FPGAs use more power than fixed-function chips and the advantages of FPGAs cannot be realized in the mobile electronics world.  Our research aims to drastically improve the energy-efficiency of FPGAs to enable their use in the battery-powered electronic devices pervasive in society today.  One of our strategies is to explore automatically placing portions of the FPGA into low-power sleeping states when not in use.

     Today, it can take hours or even days to implement a design in an FPGA, and our research seeks to reduce this time, to minutes or seconds. FPGA chips are ""regular"" -- the same circuits repeat in a tiled fashion on an FPGA.  This regularity can be used to create ""patterns"" for how circuits should be implemented on the FPGA.  Our approach is akin to taking a complex problem, breaking it into smaller problems, whose solutions can be rapidly looked-up in a library, and stitched together to form a good solution for the complex problem.

     An additional thrust is in the direction of hardware security for FPGAs, where our objective is to research and develop ways to protect FPGAs and FPGA designs from threats such as counterfeiting or tampering.

"The exploration of an unknown environment to gather information (e.g. mapping) is a problem naturally suited to the use of multiple intelligent robots. In highly challenging and dangerous environments such as urban search and rescue (USAR, where robots are used to search for human victims after a disaster) significant benefit derives from using robots with differing motor, sensory, and control abilities (heterogeneous robots). While a robot might find a crevasse it cannot enter, another team member might be small enough to move through this, for example.  Similarly, different terrain is amenable to different robot types (e.g. humanoid vs wheeled).  In such domains robots must also be considered expendable, meaning that team structure will not be static: new types of specialized robots may be called for, and robots that are lost or damaged must be replaced.  Ideally multiple teams should be released across a broad area and collaborate to build a shared map.  Existing approaches to this typically require centralized control (leaving the system vulnerable if a controller is lost), static team structures, and a shared external representation for space (e.g. GPS, which may be unavailable).  Similar issues to USAR exist in space exploration, military, and security domains, as well as area coverage tasks (e.g. robotic harvesting).  This work will involve the decentralized coordination of multiple teams of heterogeneous robots (wheeled, treaded, humanoid, and microrobots) in a USAR domain.   It will support the gradual development of a shared representation of the world and one another's abilities through local encounters between robots (without broadcast communication).  This will allow better decision making as to which tasks should be distributed to which robots (e.g. adapting to partial failure of robots, or knowing when a newly-encountered robot type might be useful).  Teams will adapt their structure as exploration unfolds, adding members to acquire new skills, for example, and removing unneeded or poorly performing members (including their leaders), allowing these to be picked up by other teams (along with the knowledge they contain). All robots will function autonomously (i.e. not rely solely on a leader) to the degree their abilities allow.

"PROGRAM OBJECTIVES: This program on muscle stem-cell (SC) regulation across taxa will:

1: Characterize the SC populations in a range of taxa. I hypothesize that satellite cell populations in muscle tissue and on isolated fibers will vary in size (number per fiber), distribution and activation state.

2: Investigate the regulation of signalling, gene expression, proliferation and myogenesis following activation of satellite-stem cells on single fibers isolated from muscle in non-mammalian taxa. I hypothesize that there are taxa-specific differences in the regulation of satellite cell activation by mechanical stretching. 

3: Evaluate the relationship between muscle phenotype and regulation of activation by signals transduced by nitric oxide, mechanical stretch, hepatocyte growth factor and follistatin. I hypothesize that muscle fibers will vary in sensitivity to stretch-activation depending on their slow vs. fast phenotype.

APPROACH: This program will develop an integrative model of SC regulation across taxa by studying muscle from zebrafish, Xenopus laevis and finches. SCs are muscle stem cells and are normally quiescent in mature mammalian muscle. Although their activation is essential for the growth and adaptation that underpin muscle plasticity, we know little about mechanisms that regulate SC activation across taxa. Since processes we see in mammals have evolved from fundamental mechanisms of SC regulation in non-mammalian vertebrates, this work will bring an evolutionary context to basic mechano-biology in muscle. 

GOALS & SIGNIFICANCE: In the long term, I aim to understand the mechanisms and impact of SC interactions with muscle fibers that control their activation. In the short term, this proposal focuses on understanding the roles of chemical, mechanical and protein signals during activation by dissecting the roles played by nitric oxide, stretch and genes that mediate SC quiescence and activation across taxa. This research will give insight into molecular mechanisms that integrate gaseous, mechanical and protein signals during SC activation and mediate muscle plasticity.

"This proposed project deals with the development and testing of novel photochemical (UV) methods for destroying persistent organic pollutants found in industrial flue gas emissions.  Under international agreements, emissions of many of these pollutants (for example, dioxins and furans) are to be virtually eliminated, but existing air pollution control technologies have limited success in some circumstances where the flue gas temperature is too low for conventional catalytic treatment technologies.  Photochemical and other advanced oxidation technologies hold promise for eliminating these pollutants without requiring the use of higher temperatures that would require significant energy inputs.



This work will extend our promising preliminary work to develop designs that may be used industrially, and to determine in more detail the efficiency and efficacy of the approach.  The photochemistry and by-product formation will be examined to ensure that all toxic compounds are eliminated.  Practical photoreactor design issues will be addressed, and the systems will be optimized to minimize costs while maximizing performance.  The effects of other flue gas components such as sulfur dioxide and particulates will be analyzed.  Non-photochemical treatment methods such as hydrogen peroxide injection will also be examined.  Finally, the extension of this approach to other similar compounds such as polybrominated fire retardants will be pursued, since these are becoming increasingly recognized as persistent in the environment. 



In the end, at least 5 graduate students will have received advanced research training in air pollution control technologies, and the potential use of UV methods for treatment of flue gases will be much more thoroughly understood.  This research will provide a scientific and engineering basis for further Canadian innovations in air pollution control technologies.

"My research examines how social and environmental conditions affect the evolution of male reproductive traits. I propose field and laboratory studies of variation in male size, development time, and mating strategies in three closely related species of cannibalistic black widow spiders. The extreme mating system of two of these species (Redbacks and Brown Widows) involves self-sacrifice by males to their cannibalistic mates. This severely restricts male mating opportunities. Thus male fitness depends on the ability to compete successfully under a limited range of conditions experienced soon after maturity. I predict that males of these species will use cues of small-scale fluctuations in competitive challenges to adjust development of adult traits to forms that are optimal for the local environment (= developmental plasticity). In contrast, males of the third species (Western Black Widows) mate with multiple females over a longer period, and are likely to encounter a range of micro-habitat challenges. I predict these males will adopt traits that perform well on average across the most commonly encountered conditions, but will not be optimal under any one condition. My work will examine this idea by measuring spatial and temporal variation in selection pressures across local and broad geographic scales, and fitness effects of variable adult traits across widely separated populations in each species. I will answer two main questions. (1) How is fitness affected by variable selection on mating strategies, development time, and body size traits within the context of each species' mating system? and (2) Does selection for developmental plasticity in sexually-selected traits depend on mating system?  Studies proposed here will shed light on causes of adaptive variation between species of black widow spiders-a group that is notable for its extreme mating systems and broad species distributions. More generally, this work will make significant contributions to our understanding of the how different levels of environmental variability affect adaptive variation within and across populations.

"Electrochemical capacitors, or ""supercapacitors"", can store the energy produced by intermittent alternative energy sources (e.g. solar panels or windmills).  They can also complement fuel cells and batteries for hybrid car applications, where the battery or fuel cell provides the energy required to drive long distances, and the capacitor delivers the high power needed for acceleration. Electrochemical capacitors are essentially maintenance free and have a much higher cycle life than batteries (they can be charged millions of times, rather than hundreds or thousands of times for batteries), making them ideal for remote applications. One poorly understood aspect of electrochemical capacitor behaviour is self-discharge, the spontaneous loss of voltage as the electrochemical capacitor sits for long periods of time.  This is of practical importance as one would like to know that the electrochemical capacitor is ready for use, whether it has been unused for a day or a year.  At this point, it is unclear why and how it loses this voltage, and this is under study in the Andreas laboratory.  

     This program is based on fundamental, basic scientific research into the causes of electrochemical capacitor self-discharge and the factors which affect the rate of this discharge.  Electrochemical methods (using electricity to study the properties of a system) will be used in this research.  This research will include studies of: the state of the surface and bulk material of the electrochemical capacitor electrode and the redox active functional groups on the electrode surface; the effect of the highly porous nature of the electrode material; the effect of impurities (such as iron and oxygen) in the capacitor electrolyte; and the stability of the electrolyte.  This will lead to very important fundamental knowledge about electrochemical capacitor self-discharge, and will then lead to the minimization or prevention of self-discharge in commercial systems. 

     Given present economic (fuel prices) and societal (environmental movement) factors, the field of energy storage is expected to grow and this research will aid both academic and industrial researchers in the quest to reduce or eliminate self-discharge in electrochemical capacitors.","Stockage et transformation de l'�nergie","Ressources d'�nergie","Anal. & Phys.

"The main direction of this grant proposal is to populate exotic nuclei situated at the very limit of nuclear stability and at the extremes of neutron-to-proton ratios, into the so-called ""Terra Incognita"" region of the nuclear chart. These nuclei, which are produced in laboratories on Earth with very low probabilities, are sometimes also involved in nuclear astrophysics processes which take place in stars, and help the scientists to elucidate the origin of the elements in the Universe. 



Until recently such studies were carried out by using stable beams, and although there is much to be discovered using such beams, the focus is now on radioactive ion beams which define the future perspectives of nuclear studies far from stability in North America and worldwide.



An extensive research programme at TRIUMF at the ISAC I and II facilities using sophisticated and highly efficient detector systems will explore how the nuclear structure envolves at the limits of stability and the element productions in stars.

For most evolutionary biologists, speciation is synonymous with the evolution of barriers to gene exchange (reproductive isolation) between diverging lineages. Despite the vast number of genes present in all organisms only relatively few genes, so called ""speciation genes"", are presumably involved in the origins of the species. My research focuses on the identification and characterization of speciation genes in insects, the most diverse group of animals on the Earth. To do so, my research group combines proteomics, population genomics, and quantitative/functional genetics techniques to identify genes/genomic regions responsible for a broad range of adaptations leading to population differentiation and reproductive isolation.

    During the duration of this proposal our research will cover different type of barriers to gene flow during the early stages of the speciation process. Specifically, we will focus on the molecular genetics basis of the ecological isolation between host races of soapberry bugs (Jadera haematoloma), and the genetic architecture of post-mating isolation between closely related species of field crickets (Genus Gryllus). Hence, our research covers different type of barriers to gene flow during the early stages of the speciation process. Using a multidisciplinary approach we will (1) locate chromosomal region/genes related with ecological differentiation in soapberry bugs, and (2) assess the role of reproductive (i.e. seminal) protein genes in the reproductive isolation between two hybridizing species of field crickets.

     Characterizing genes related with ecological and gametic isolation (i.e. barrier genes) in two very different systems would provide us with an emerging picture of the genetic changes that lead to the formation of new species in this important taxonomic Class.

"When a laser beam guides in a solid medium the light spreads out (diffracts) over distance. In some cases, the diffraction effect is counteracted when the intensity of light acts to alter the refractive index of the medium. In this case, the beam might act on itself (optical self-action) to counteract the effect of diffraction. If the optical self-action exactly balances diffraction we have have self-focusing and the wave creates its own waveguide to give something called a spatial soliton. Solitons like these are of interest to optical comunications because they can travel over long distances without the need of amplification or correction. In some media, like certain organic polymers and photosensitive glasses, soliton-like behaviour is observed. The difference is that the waveguide that is created is permanent. This research program seeks to understand the physical and chemical processes behind Light Induced Self Inscription (LISI) in media that exhibit a permanent refractive index change. The idea is to carefully describe the underlying photochemistry that supports permanent self-writing. Over the term of this grant, the author will explore LISI in polymers, polymer composites, ""molecular silica"" cage-polymer composites and hybrid organic-inorganic glasses. The research will have impact on our understanding of the origins of the phenomenon and how it might be used to make optical integrated circuit devices.

     In Canada, an increased demand for high water quality and stringent regulations are the main drivers for seeking alternatives to conventional water treatment processes.  In addition, the detection of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in wastewater effluents as well as drinking waters has brought increasing attention with respect to potential treatment methodologies for their removal.  



     This research will examine three methods that may potentially be easily implemented in water treatment facilities.  Powdered activated carbon (PAC) has been used for decades for taste and odour removal, however it is also known as a means to remove organic micropollutants.  The proposed research will examine the ability of PAC to remove a range of EDCs and PhACs.  In addition, it will provide data that may be used by other researchers in assessing whether this technology should be considered for emerging compounds.  Ultrafiltration, a practice that is now being adopted as an alternative to conventional filtration, will be examined as a means of micropollutant reduction by combining it with PAC.  Various methods of PAC addition prior to membranes will be studied.  Finally, the use of granular activated carbon (GAC) will be assessed using both methods that are currently avilable and also simpler ones that are being developed and may be more easily adopted by water treatment utilities and consultants.

"Porous semiconductor films are one of today's most fundamentally fascinating and technologically promising materials classes with potential and realized applications in fields such as photonics and biomaterials technology. Exploration and characterization of the properties of porous semiconductor films is, however, in its infancy, due mainly to their novelty and the limited number of techniques capable of probing the fragile nanostructure.  In particular, there have been few studies of elastic wave propagation in these systems and the relationships between the elastic properties and other system parameters have yet to be established.  Knowledge of the elastic properties of porous semiconductors is also important for device applications.  It has been proposed, for example, that Young's modulus of porous Si be tuned by varying the porosity to match that of cortical or cancellous bone thereby enabling its use as a bone-building scaffold. The research program that I plan to pursue at Memorial University will use Brillouin spectroscopy to probe the elastic properties of porous semiconductor films and related systems and, in conjunction with complementary laser spectroscopy studies, will facilitate discovery and quantification of the relationships between these properties and the structural and optical properties of these systems. The proposed research is an extension of my earlier work on porous semiconductors via laser spectroscopy techniques and levers expertise in device fabrication and materials characterization gained during employment with Nortel and in porous semiconductor film synthesis at Memorial University.  Systems of particular interest include porous Si multilayers, carbon nanotube arrays and nanocolumnar porous SiC films.

"Mathematical models of random systems, such as particle systems, random graphs, percolation and random walks, are of importance in mathematical physics, computer science, combinatorics and probability theory. Although these models had been studied extensively in the past, they have been receiving considerable renewed attention, following recent breakthroughs based on the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE).



While models vary and have diverse motivations, a common goal of much of the research is understanding the asymptotic structure of random objects or the behaviour of random systems, as their size grows.



I am working on various models of random graphs, including random planar maps, percolation on finite graphs and invasion percolation, and am studying their geometric and topological properties. I am also interested in various dynamical systems: more particularly, the exclusion processes and some cellular automata. Finally, I am interested in problems concerning various random walks, and have been working on a number of those.

"Agile mechanical systems represent a class of mechanical systems designed for high-speed manoeuvres. Two examples of these are Sch�nflies-motion generators, a.k.a. parallel SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) systems, and grippers intended to grasp drifting objects. The former require a stiff, yet light structure, capable of withstanding high operation frequencies. For example, one commercial robot of this class, capable of performing a cycle test that requires traversing a 700-mm path, in the form of an open rectangle, in one-third of a second, reportedly produces accelerations of its moving plate of up to 15g. As this cycle includes sharp changes of direction, the excitation frequencies involved can be of the order of 1 kHz, well beyond a typical value for the excitation of a mechanical structure. Moreover, the structure in question is hyperstatic, which means that small manufacturing errors render the closed kinematic chain impossible to assemble. We intend to cope with the design and control challenges posed by such systems using robustness. Grippers of the above kind involve one not less challenging feature: while grabbing the drifting object with a fast closing of its fingers, the gripping action should be gentle enough to avoid breaking fragile objects. Applications of the latter, beyond the obvious grabbing of objects drifting in space, include the grasping of living tissue in robot-assisted surgical operations. The tools requested in this application are intended to support experimental work intended to validate the models formulated using sound knowledge of continuum mechanics and multibody mechanics, including the theory of kinematic chains, besides control and system theory.

"Productivity-enhancement has called for fast, efficient robotic mechanical systems capable of moving a payload with motions of a special kind, that exclude some rigid-body motions, which has given rise to what is known as lower-mobility robots or mechanisms. These entail kinematic loops, as they bear a parallel architecture. As a consequence, these systems are inherently overconstrained, in that any manufacturing and assembly errors either make loop-closure impossible or limit their degree of freedom. Expert designers use extra joints to cope with this feature, the downside being that stiffness, and hence, precision, are compromised. In the research program proposed here for the next five years we will investigate the design and control of lower-mobility robots. On the design side, we will introduce complexity as a main design criterion, for it can handle the limited amount of information available at the conceptual stage of the design process. By assigning a complexity measure to each of the machine performance aspects, precision, stiffness and assemblability, we will be able to face the current challenges of industry. The main idea here is to distribute the load as uniformly as possible among all actuators, while aiming at a mechanical structure with geometric, kinematic and mechanical symmetries. The outcome should be a mechanical system with the same precision and stiffness properties in any direction of motion, and the same natural frequencies. However, functional requirements may make it impossible to meet the foregoing ideal conditions. In this case, a compromise should be reached in aiming at machines whose performance lies as closely as possible to the foregoing ideal. On the control side, we will also use complexity as a major design criterion, which will allow us to produce the simplest control-system architecture, one approaching a parallel array of identical single-input, single-output control subsystems, one for each motion direction of the payload.

"The phenomenon of ""spin loss'' is well known in the automotive industry, for it affects all transmissions, hybrid

and otherwise, the challenge in the development of the former being that, in there, every watt gained counts.

Spin loss stems from the oil churning around and between the rotating friction plates in an open clutch, thereby

creating drag on the transmission. The larger the clutch and the higher the torque capacity, the larger the

amount of spin loss. Current hybrid vehicles feature what are called on-axis transmission designs, wherein the

axes of bearings and gear train coincide. A front wheel drive (FWD) transmission has to package, along with

the engine, transversely in between, the frame rails of the vehicle. As such, the length restriction on a FWD

transmission design is much more constraining. For a FWD hybrid transmission, packaging two motors, range

clutches and a final drive in the allowable length becomes much more difficult. Packaging constraints may

force the designer to choose a large bearing, which would lead to higher bearing losses. In this project we adopt

a clean-sheet approach, and undertake a thorough investigation on the physical principles governing the

operation of a clutch. These principles will then be used to explore novel clutch designs. Alternatives to be

explored in the course of the project include novel electromechanical arrangements that satisfy the conflicting

requirements of compactness, quick response, high power density, and low spin losses. The use of smart

materials for actuation is a possibility, if we can integrate them so that they will offer real packaging,

functional, and cost advantages. For minimizing bearing losses, we propose to investigate off-axis hybrid

transmission designs wherein the electrical motor is not on the same axis as the transmission centreline. For

minimizing electric motor spin losses, we will investigate designs with clutched motors, wherein the motor can

be disengaged when not in operation. The deliverables of the project will be a) one to two virtual prototypes of

the most promising design alternatives identified after the first year of the project and b) one physical

proof-of-concept prototype of the alternative chosen at the end of the second year.

"A multicellular organism can be viewed as a community of individual cells that live in a very organized society. This society relies on an intricate communication network that control individual cell fate, survival, and proliferation to ensure the well being of the global organism. Each cell at its turn possesses a very complex molecular network to control the different aspects of its function and development. If, globally, all cells are comparable, the exact network composition of each individual cell must be adjusted to allow each cell specific function and control its growth in the limits of its particular tissue. We are studying ubiquitin ligases, a particular class of proteins that are a very important part of the regulating machinery responsible for fine tuning and adjustment of specific parts of the cell molecular network. By studying this class of enzyme, how they are controlled, and how in turn they control other proteins, we hope to gain a better understanding of cellular physiology, and how it is properly maintained in health, or altered in disease.

This RTI grant application is for purchase of a gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). It has now become necessary and urgent to replace two older GC-FID equipments acquired in 1985, and in 1987, respectively, which are barely functional, and no longer serviced by the equipment supplier. GC-FID is heavily used by the students and research personnel of the applicants as well as a majority of researchers at the Department of Food Science and Nutrition and their research personnel for a variety of analytes such as fatty acids, and their isomers and derivatives; triacylglycerols; amino acids; flavor and aroma compounds; compounds produced by deteriorative chemical or biochemical reactions; primary and secondary metabolites (metabolomic); bioactive compounds; and biomarkers. Very often, compounds of interest are isolated in small amounts from plant and animal sources or produced in small amounts from deteriorative reactions; and gas chromatgraphy is the most convenient technique as long as the analytes are volatile or semi-voltile. Acquisition of the proposed equipment will ensure continued accessibility of GC to students at the department, and avoid delays in their thesis schedules. The proposed equipment is in great demand and will be used to its full capacity.

"Canada is an important producer of fats and oils (Canola, soya, flax, lard, tallow) and a major user of fats and oils for industrial frying. In the present context of low saturates, zero trans and omega-3 nutrition, heating fats and oils results more than ever in thermolytic and oxydative processes leading to the formation of degradation products such as cyclic fatty acid monomers, oligomers (polymers), trans and oxygenated fatty acids, and in volatile breakdown molecules. While the products of degradation may transform healthy oils into products which are harmful to human health, the thermal stability of the oils is a growing economic preoccupation for the food industry. Thus our long term goal is to develop ways to control the modification of fats and oils at high temperatures (as in frying) through a better understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of the chemical reactions leading to the decomposition of the lipid molecules, and also by which non-traditionnal lipidic antioxidants may act as protective agents for unsaturated fatty acids.

    Our objectives for the next five years are: 1) to determine the kinetic parameters of cyclization reactions involved in degradation of unsaturated fatty acids; 2) to study the mechanisms by which cyclic fatty acids are formed at frying temperatures, using unsaturated fatty acids and labeled unsaturated fatty acids, which we will synthesize; and 3) to elucidate the mechanisms by which conjugated lipidic antioxidants may react with oxygen at frying temperatures. 

    Knowledge gained from this research will lead to a better understanding of the reactions through which the constituents of fats and oils, specifically unsaturated FA, are decomposed during the frying process and of the mode of action of a new generation of heat-activated natural lipidic antioxidants. This research which will provide training for more than three graduate students in the field of fats and oils, will also contribute to the development of strategies to effectively improve the usable life of frying oils, resulting in lower costs for the industry, while limiting concerns for human health.

"The primary reason for someone to get a knee replacement is to reduce his or her pain due to arthritis.  Unfortunately, some people still have considerable pain after the surgery, often in the region of the kneecap (called anterior knee pain). Frequently this pain is attributed to incorrect tracking of the kneecap (patella) on the thigh bone (femur) due to improper component design, incorrect placement of the components, excessively tight soft tissues or poor surgical technique. Currently, the only method most surgeons use to 'look inside' the knee is X-rays, which are two-dimensional images at a single angle of knee flexion. These provide inadequate information to study the movements of the bones.  We are proposing to develop a new method to measure the three-dimensional positions of both the bones and components after knee replacement surgery at different flexion angles, using computed tomography (CT).  CT produces a 3D image of the patient's knees. The metal components create streaks on the image, making it difficult to identify the bones and components accurately, however we are proposing several ways to address  this. We will validate the protocol using reference arrays inserted into cadaveric knee specimens. We will then apply the protocol to patients in order to judge whether or not a recent implant design improves kneecap motion; subsequently, we will compare patients with and without pain. In addition, and in contrast, to CT, we will develop a protocol for two-dimensional fluoroscopic imaging, which is dynamic (i.e. captures a video of movement), inexpensive, widely available and could be applied in

routine clinical practice. We will also investigate the clinical utility of 3D fluoroscopy.  Our longterm objectives are to seek relationships between preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative patellar tracking and pain. By so doing, we hope to identify characteristics linked with postoperative pain, address these through changes in implant design or surgical technique and potentially screen patients preoperatively if they have a higher likelihood of postoperative pain.","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel",2,"CHRPJ ","Collaborative Health Research Projects",Alberta,Alberta
"The primary reason for someone to get a knee replacement is to reduce his or her pain due to arthritis. Unfortunately, some people still have considerable pain after the surgery, often in the vicinity of the kneecap (called anterior knee pain). The reasons for this pain are usually unknown. Pain and other problems with the implant are often attributed to incorrect tracking of the kneecap (patella) on the thigh bone (femur) due to less-than-optimal placement of the components during surgery. Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) uses information about the patient's anatomy and the location of the surgeon's tools to guide the surgeon to place the components in the best position; however, so far, this has focused on the large knee bones (femur and tibia) and not the patella. We are proposing four related projects to answer the following questions: (1) Can a novel computer-assisted method be developed to improve the patellar cut, and is it more accurate than the traditional approach? (2) Can an improved method be developed to measure the movement of the patella before and after placing the components and is the accuracy comparable to a gold standard, namely computed-tomography (CT)? (3) Can these systems be successfully implemented clinically, based on the accuracy of the resulting cut angle compared to the non-CAS approach, the extra time required, and the clinical results? (4) Does resurfacing the knee with implant components have a significant effect on patellar kinematics measured intraoperatively? In the longterm, our goals are to achieve symmetric patellar bone cuts and balanced patellar tracking to improve patient quality of life and implant longevity, and to use intraoperative kinematic measurements to improve implant design and surgical technique.","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Mechanical Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"From humble beginnings as a simple ""field station"" in 1972, the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre (BMSC) - operated by a consortium of 5 Alberta and BC universities - has matured into a national treasure as a research and training facility in the coastal and marine sciences.  BMSC provides essential, increasingly world-class support of field and laboratory research to scientists from across Canada (e.g., co-applicants and users come from 5 provinces).  It attracts established and distinguished researchers (5 Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada, 4 Canada Research Chairs, a Canadian Institute for Advanced Research Scholar and Fellow, and Pew International and Steacie Fellows) as well as bright, young researchers (2 co-applicants are newly appointed faculty).  As a measure of its broad appeal, in the last year, BMSC has supported research by international users from 11 countries, and many private sector (2 aquaculture companies and 3 consulting companies), and government users (Pacific Geosciences Centre, Parks Canada, Dept. of Fisheries & Oceans, BC Ministry of Environment, Canadian Navy).  BMSC is also an active collaborator in the world-leading NEPTUNE ocean-science project.  Recent investments in infrastructure have added significant new research capacity to BMSC (new research labs in the Rix Centre for Ocean Discoveries, a Fluid Dynamics Laboratory with a unique 12 m flume and sophisticated flow-visualization system, a cutting-edge confocal microscope, a Remotely Operated Vehicle and dive tender for exploring deep water habitats) that supports a wide array of behavioral, ecological, physiological and developmental studies.  Consequently, research productivity is growing dramatically, from 37 refereed publications per year (1995-2004) to 47, 51 and 60 per year respectively in the last three years.  However, BMSC requires increased funding for technical and professional staff, and to cover increased operating expenses, to a) make the most of this enhanced research capacity, b) maintain aging infrastructure in a state of suitable research readiness, and c) sustain the growing productivity and international prestige of what is, undeniably, a major Canadian research resource.

"Disorders of the spinal cord are devastating conditions leaving patients with severe lifelong disabilities. It is estimated that ~13,000 individuals suffer paralysis from spinal injuries yearly in North America alone with limited treatment options. Multiple sclerosis is a progressive autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system and eventually affecting the spinal cord which leads to progressive and irreversible disability, leaving most patients wheelchair-bound.  The ultimate objective of this collaborative project is to design and implement a robust fiber-based non-linear optical microscope with miniaturized scanning mechanism and objective lens (< 3mm diameter) that can image spinal cord relatively non-invasively and non-destructively over time in living animals, in 3 dimensions, at sub-micron resolution. The project is divided into 3 specific aims: -Aim 1 (yr 1): to develop a fiber optic based laser scanning CARS/TPEF microscope capable of imaging excised spinal cord tissue in vitro -Aim 2 (yr 2): to modify the system in Aim 1 in order to include multimodal exoscopic capability to enable imaging of intact spinal cord in live rats -Aim 3 (yr 3): to further optimize the system in #2 to image evolution of spinal cord lesions (traumatic, demyelinating) in rodents over time and correlate with MRI data. Modifications will be performed to image mouse cords where axons are genetically encoded to provide green-yellow fluorescence, which together with CARS, will provide a complete picture of the axon-myelin unit.

The knowledge generated within this project and the resulting technology will significantly help our ability to improve the prognosis and potential treatments of spinal cord disorders. Beyond the successful completion of this project, the same technology can be easily adapted to image organ systems which would have a larger impact in a wide range of applications that range from surgical interventions to disease diagnosis.","Sant� publique (y compris recherche psychologique li�e � la m�decine)","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel",2,"CHRPJ ","Collaborative Health Research Projects",Ontario,Ontario

"As the silicon industry moves towards nanometre designs, one of the most important design challenges is the increasing variability in device characteristics. Device variations significantly impact the chips' performance, power budget and ultimately its yield. The proposed research investigates the design of novel integrated circuits and design automation methodologies while maximizing chips' yield.

The innovative feature of this research is offering design techniques and methodologies to design circuits while having an understanding of lithography-induced variations, which is critical to chips' yield. The idea is to back-annotate the lithography-induced variations to the circuit and high level design with appropriate models that can be calibrated to achieve adequate accuracy, significant power reductions and high yield values. Such a design methodology is imperative to exploit the full potential of performance and power management techniques in chips while meeting highest levels of functional yield. The research will demonstrate that cooperative lithography/circuit/CAD co-design will have a profound impact on the way robust chips are designed in future nanometre generations.

"A bit error rate tester (BERT) is needed to expand the capabilities of  the existing software defined radio (SDR) integrated testbed. This tester will be used to easily, correctly and rapidly measure the error rates when verifying the in-house radio resource management and radio access algorithms that are developed for emerging wireless communication systems. It will save considerable amount of time of the researchers while providing accurate error rates.

"Engineering solutions offer a promising solution to preventing unintended harm to patients in health care. Advances in technology have brought about an exponential increase in the amount of physiological data collected in many health care settings. Continuous physiological monitoring is widely used during surgery, in the intensive care unit, in hospital wards, and in private homes to provide timely warning of changes in a patient's condition. Despite major advances in sensor technology, the means of advising clinicians of significant events is still underdeveloped. More effective use of the information produced by currently available and new physiological sensors can be used to vastly improve patient safety through enhanced monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment of patients. 



The successful introduction of intelligent monitoring and automated control promises to harness this information to enhance safety, as it has in other industries such as aviation. Such intelligent data analysis requires a multifaceted approach. A range of techniques can be used to present the salient information and combine information from multiple sources.

"I propose to continue research in the broad area of Discrete Mathematics with a focus on two areas: Extremal Set Theory and Matchings

  Extremal Set Theory considers a family of subsets of {1,2,..., m}  and, given some property imposed on the family, asks whether you can bound the size of the family. With no property, you get the bound of 2  raised to the power m. If you use the property that every pair of sets in the family intersect, then we get the bound 2 raised to the power m-1. This is easily seen to be true by considering that each subset  of  {1,2,.., m}  can be paired with its complement and at most one of the two sets can be chosen for the family. Some of the properties that I will be considering are called forbidden configurations.   Given the elementary nature of the forbidden configuration property, it is expected to find applications of these results. These properties (under the name VC-dimension) have found applications to Learning Theory and Computational Geometry. With Sali, we have developed a beautiful conjecture that suggests what structures inside the forbidden configuration really drive the asymptotic bounds. 

  Given a 2mx2m checkerboard, one can ask whether you can cover it with dominoes; each domino covering two squares. This problem is easy and in fact Kastelyn counted  the large number of possible ways to do so (using this for statistical mechanics). Can you disrupt the checkerboard and still find a covering by dominoes? For example you could ask what happens if you delete some squares. Obviously you need to delete an equal number of black and white squares since each domino covers one square of each colour. If you add the simple requirement that the deleted black squares be far apart (at least 4 times square root of m) and the same restriction on the deleted whites then a covering is still possible. Moreover the use of square root of m in the distance is best possible.  These  problems are best described in  graph theory; the coverings are called matchings.  Investigations on some sensible graphs are continuing.

"Fundamental knowledge of the stability of minerals and the arrangement of atoms in their crystal structure as they exist deep in the Earth are important for providing realistic models for Earth processes.  This research program attempts to answer the questions, why do solid materials have the properties that they exhibit? How do these properties change under different pressure and temperature (P and T) conditions?  How does the ordering of atoms in a structure change in response to P and T?  What are the effects of order-disorder on intrinsic properties?  Physical, mechanical, thermodynamic, elastic, and chemical properties are governed by the arrangement of atoms in a solid on an atomic scale.  Therefore, it is necessary to determine the atomic structures of materials, including minerals, using a multi-disciplinary approach and using various in situ experimental techniques to investigate the processes that govern their stabilities and properties under non-ambient (different P and T) conditions, including composition and time, and applying the results to Mineral Physics and Earth processes.  The applicant is an established synchrotron radiation researcher who has used state-of-the-art experimental techniques at National Facilities in USA and France (APS, NSLS, and ESRF) and hopes to use or establish similar techniques at the Canadian Light Source (CLS) at Saskatoon.  My research program is based heavily on physical chemistry and diffraction physics using laboratory techniques and synthesis, X-ray structure analyses, spectroscopy, electron microscopy, element analyses, and thermal analyses, in addition to active research at National Synchrotron and Neutron Facilities.  Selected minerals will be examined in situ under different P and T conditions.  The resulting information will provide insight into the mechanisms by which minerals are formed, and provide a quantitative understanding of Earth processes.  With varying P and T, minerals may undergo changes in cation/anion order-disorder.  These order-disorder processes may have significant effect on the velocities of sound waves in the Earth.  Therefore, order-disorder effects need to be taken into account when geophysical models are proposed for the Earth.","Sciences de la terre","Avancement des connaissances","Solid Earth Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"Oxyfuel Technology is one of the few potential technologies that can offer pure streams of CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels for sequestration.  The technology has now advanced to the stage of demonstration in using conventional suspension fired technology, and there are plans to build units as large as 600 MWe.  Oxyfuel Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion (CFBC) is by contrast a largely unexplored technology, which has a large number of potential advantages over conventional coal burning even in the oxygen fired mode.  First, Circulating Fluidized Beds are able to burn a large range of fuels, and co-fire with biomass over any desired range, which offers the possibility of using such seasonally available fuels in a CO2 negative fashion.  Second, because of the fact that CFBC circulate large amounts of solids it is possible to reduce the amount of flue gas being recycled thus allowing a size reduction of the boiler by up to 30%, and finally the technology is extremely fuel flexible thus allowing a complete range of Canadian feedstocks from asphaltenes, petroleum cokes, waste coal and lignitic fuels to be used in a given unit.  At the moment CANMET is in discussions with both Foster Wheeler who are schedule to build a full-scale demonstration unit in 2011, and the Canadian Clean-Coal Power Coalition to support these developments.



CANMET has built two pilot plants (combustor diameters of 100 mm and 400 mm) to support this technology, and this proposal is directed to training students and accelerating the knowledge bases for oxy-fired CFBC so as to make it available to Canadians' in anticipation of a CO2 constrained world. It is proposed to carry out fundamental research on the implications of oxygen firing in a CFBC as well as address ash and emission issues relating to oxygen use.","�nergie �lectrique","Ressources d'�nergie","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"As computation plays an ever larger role as an embedded part of the environment, research that seeks to understand the embodied nature of human's interactions with computation becomes increasingly important. Embodied interaction is an approach to understanding human computer interaction that seeks to investigate and support the complex interplay of mind, body and environment in interaction. This approach is relevant for a broad class of systems that rely on direct physical interaction with computation embedded in the physical environment including mixed reality, tangible computing, responsive environments, pervasive computing and physical computing. Physically-based forms of child computer interaction including body movements, the ability to touch, feel, manipulate and build sensory awareness of the relationships in the world is crucial to children's cognitive development. The focus of this five year program of research is the investigation of how child users create meaning through action and interaction with embedded computational environments. 



Specifically, I will focus on three interrelated research areas. First, I will continue to study how embodied conceptual metaphors can be used as foundations for the design of interactive environments for both children and adults. Secondly, I will continue to study how interactive environments and tangible objects can be designed to augment cognition and accelerate learning by supporting children to offload difficult cognitive activities to direct physical interaction. Thirdly, I will support such investigations through the research and development of enabling technologies and resulting prototypes of new forms of embedded computational environments and tangible objects. Taken together, these three interwoven streams of research form a comprehensive and innovative research program in human computer interaction.

"The availability of highly versatile systems-on-a-chip and powerful computer hardware have led to a heavy demand for digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms and methodologies that can be used in a wide variety of applications, for example, to design digital filters, to process images, or to analyze DNA sequences.  This research will deal with a fairly broad selection of projects concerning the development of DSP algorithms and methodologies for communications and other related applications such as the following:  

(a)    )	Powerful optimization techniques will be used to develop advanced design methodologies for digital filters that would satisfy a variety of specifications.

(b)    )	Genetic algorithms that operate on the principles of natural evolution will be applied to a diverse range of  specialized design problems to exploit the flexibility of these algorithms and their ability to explore multiple locales of the parameter space simultaneously.

(c)    )	The so-called set-membership concept will be applied along with modern optimization methods to develop new classes of  adaptive filters and to apply these filters to applications such as echo cancellation, near-end crosstalk cancellation, and the elimination of multipath signals in wireless communications.

(d)    )	We plan to combine analysis techniques for nonnegative matrices, the singular-value decomposition, and state-of-the art optimization techniques for the purpose of enhancing the quality of the information that can be extracted from DNA sequences and to extend the application of these techniques to microarrays.

(e)    )	 We will continue our work on the application of state-of-the-art optimization techniques to the image super-resolution problem.   Image super-resolution is a class of techniques that can be used to construct high-resolution images using a collection of low-resolution images.

"Le Phosphore (P) est un �l�ment nutritif majeur, c'est-�-dire requis par les plantes en grande quantit�, pour leur croissance. Aujourd'hui, les agriculteurs ajoutent de 3 � 4 fois les besoins de la plante en superphosphate soluble, car la majeure partie de ces engrais pr�cipite dans les sols l'ann�e de l'application pour former des phosphates de calcium, d'aluminium ou de fer qui sont insolubles et donc peu disponibles aux plantes. Une grande partie du phosphore est aussi immobilis�e dans les sols sous forme de P organique, qui peut repr�senter environ la moiti� des r�serves. Ainsi, les sols agricoles mod�r�ment fertilis�s contiennent des r�serves importantes en P organique et inorganique. Notre laboratoire d�veloppe depuis plusieurs ann�es des technologies bas�es sur l'utilisation de microorganismes b�n�fiques capables de dissoudre le P insoluble (PSM), pour mettre � profit les r�serves importantes du P dans les sols. Ainsi, nous avons montr� qu'il est possible de r�duire au champ, l'application d'engrais soluble de moiti� lorsqu'on inocule le ma�s avec des PSM, sans diminuer le rendement. Nous avons aussi d�velopp� des PSM capables d'am�liorer la r�activit� des phosphates naturels, qui seront tr�s utiles en agriculture biologique. Cependant, comme ces microorganismes une fois introduits dans les sols interagissent de fa�on al�atoire avec la microflore autochtone et forment souvent des biofilms, les r�sultats des essais d'inoculation peuvent �tre tr�s variables, surtout d'une r�gion agricole � une autre. Dans ce programme de recherche, nous proposons l'utilisation d'un consortium de microorganismes sp�cifique � chaque r�gion agricole, qui formera des biofilms b�n�fiques pour am�liorer la nutrition phosphat�e du ma�s en utilisant peu d'intrants engrais soluble (agriculture durable) ou les phosphates naturels (agriculture biologique). Nous pensons que ces consortiums �limineront les interactions al�atoires et produiront des r�sultats r�p�titifs et fiables lors des essais d'inoculation au champ.

"The proposed research program is specialized in the area of software maintenance process modeling. Software process models have been extensively investigated in the context of the forward engineering software life cycle, but only a few authors have investigated process models in the context of software maintenance and evolution. The short-term objectives of this research grant is twofold: (1) to design the advanced practices of the process model; and (2) to develop support methods and tools, to support software maintenance process improvement. To do so methods to assess current strengths and weaknesses of software maintenance processes, activities and practices have to be investigated and, from there, process models to describe low to high maturity processes have to be investigated. This research will highlight the software maintenance concepts that need to be addressed by the process model. Experimental research will be carried out to complement the initial verification and validation of the advanced practices using case studies. Case studies on the use of the S3m as a tool for continuous improvements in software maintenance could contribute to the development of a better understanding of the problems of the software maintenance function. Feedback of case studies will be analyzed to improve the process model, including the addition of process attributes and indicators to support the maturity rating process. Industrial partners will be involved in experimental analysis in real software maintenance improvement programs where improvement decisions are made. In addition, output from this research will be used to update and improve the international standards ISO14764 and ISO/IEC TR 19759 content. Novelty of this work is demonstrated by the results of this research recently published in two books 'Improving software maintenance' by the publisher Loze-Dion in 2006 and 'Software Maintenance Management: Evaluation and Continuous Improvement' by Wiley in 2008. Masters and Ph.D. students will address various research issues on the basis of the funding granted. Bachelor and Masters students have already initiated research work.

"The research outlined in this proposal deals with the synthesis of novel compounds with a variety of potentially useful applications. The compounds are based on dimetal tetracarboxylates which consist of two bonded metal ions, usually ruthenium, to which are attached four bridging organic carboxylic acid (eg. acetic acid) groups.  Four aspects of their chemistry are being investigated. 1) The development of new synthetic methodology that ""disassembles"" the complexes into ""simpler"" compounds which are not accessible from other routes. This allows for the creation of new chiral (handed) complexes and polymer precursors which will have application in asymmetric catalysis (creation of specifically left or right-""handed"" complexes) and conducting polymers. 2) The high magnetism that is inherent in the diruthenium compounds will be tuned by varying the carboxylate and/or axial groups.  This could lead to a ""switching"" between high and low magnetic moments as a function of temperature, for example. We hope that such compounds will be used to create useful magnetic/electronic molecular devices, i.e. ultra small-scale machines that perform a desired function. The molecular device, in our case, is created from the ground up. All circuitry found in computers today is constructed by the limited miniaturization of larger components. 3) The synthesis of liquid crystals based on these complexes will be undertaken by changing the carboxylates to long-chain fatty acid groups that may or may not include additional metals. Liquid-crystals display properties of both liquids and solids, making them useful in such things as display screens and sensors.  We are creating inorganic liquid crystals in order to improve on the properties of existing organic systems. 4) Early studies on some of our compounds have shown them to be active against some cancer cell lines. By improving their water-solubility (to aid in uptake and to reduce toxicity) and by attaching ""biologically relevant"" portions to them, we will generate complexes that show better activity against drug-resistant cancer cell lines. The proposal covers a wide range of concepts and techniques. Exposure to these areas is essential in training students at all levels for futures in scientific and non-scientific careers.

"Forests play an integral role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into vegetation biomass through photosynthesis and releasing CO2 through plant and soil respiration and biomass decomposition. Plantation or afforested forests in both Canada and the United States have been a large carbon (C) sink over many of the last decades. However, recent studies indicate that their carbon sequestration capabilities are being affected by changes in regional climate. Climate warming, increasing winter/summer temperatures and heat events have increased evaporation, causing more frequent drought events. Short-term, severe drought events may significantly reduce forest photosynthetic uptake, particularly when they occur during the peak growing periods of spring and early summer. Changes in forest hydrology alters soil carbon emissions as well, which feeds-back on both carbon and water cycles. 



In this proposal completely integrated sap flow systems are being requested that will be used to investigate the impacts of artificially-induced spring and early-summer droughts on evapotranspiration and forest growth in an age-sequence of afforested temperate pine stands (70-, 35-, 7-year-old), in Eastern Canada. This study will help to evaluate the impact of future climate change effects (e.g. warming, drought, etc.) on forest ecosystems. Implementation of this knowledge in the CLASS-CTEM+N model (used in Canadian Global Climate Models), would provide an assessment tool to generate scenarios of future climate for policy development and help Canada meet its international obligations. Few researchers have investigated the relationship between hydrology and carbon cycling in forest ecosystems, particularly in afforested stands. This knowledge would also help to develop adaptation strategies for the growth and survival of forests under changing future climates, so that they may continue to provide society with numerous ecological and recreation services, in addition to clean water.

"Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases are a concern to scientists and policy-makers, because they trap longwave radiation emitted from Earth, contributing to our atmosphere's warming. Recently released fourth UN IPCC report concluded that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Canada considers its forests as a potential carbon (C) sink. However, Canadian government has not yet decided whether it will adopt the biological C sink option to offset fossil fuel emissions, due to uncertainties associated with biological C sinks, particularly in forests. Future warming of the climate may have a severe impact on the health and growth of Canadian forest ecosystems, which are already being seriously affected by current warmer climatic conditions. This Strategic Grant Proposal (SGP) focuses on evaluating the capabilities of three key Eastern Canadian forest ecosystems, a conifer age-sequence (65, 35, 5 year old), deciduous, and mixedwood stands, to sequester atmospheric CO2 and their response to future climate change (e.g. warming, drought, etc.). This SGP would also focus on developing and incorporating a nitrogen (N) cycle model in the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM+N). CTEM+N will be used to explore the impact of natural and anthropogenic effects (i.e. increased N deposition, CO2 fertilization, severe drought and flooding events, temperature stresses, etc) on simulated C and water exchanges in all three (conifer, deciduous and mixedwood) forest ecosystems under various future climate change scenarios. Quantification of the responses of all three major Eastern Canadian forest ecosystems to climate change would equip environmental planners and managers to develop strategies that may help these ecosystems to better adapt to future climate change. Implementation of CTEM+N in the Canadian Global Climate Model would provide an assessment tool to generate scenarios of future climate for policy development and help Canada meet its international obligations.","Climat et atmosph�re",Environnement,"Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario

"Sub/super-critical fluid technology involves the use of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) at temperature and pressure conditions below or above its critical point, eliminating the use of petroleum-based organic solvents in the processing of crop biomass. Use of water and CO2 under such conditions leads to the development of novel ""green"" technologies, such as the extraction of health-benefiting bioactive compounds from crop biomass that can be used as ingredients in functional foods, reactions of cellulosic materials to convert them to high-value ingredients/products and future formation of micro/nano-particles as delivery systems for these bioactive compounds. The use of sub/super-critical water in extraction processes is scarce as well as its use as a reaction media. The applicant's research area has focused on the use of supercritical fluid technology, solubility behavior, extraction of nutraceuticals and modeling/simulation. Future work would therefore continue to build on this expertise and would focus on further processing development in sub/super-critical water. The main goal of my research program is to add value to Canadian crop biomass based on novel sub/super-critical fluid technology development. The specific objectives are to: i) understand the solubility behavior of bioactive compounds in sub/super-critical water, ii) investigate the effect of process parameters in order to design, develop and optimize extraction, iii) study the kinetics and reaction mechanisms of targeted conversion of components of crop biomass in sub/super-critical water, iv) evaluate the advantages of combining extraction and reactions under supercritical media, and v) model/simulate sub/super-critical extraction processes. The requested funding is critical to undertake this research program and to train highly qualified personnel. Student training is a top priority to fulfill food industry needs in Canada in the field of rapidly growing sub/super-critical fluid technology. This research program will also allow me to enhance national and international collaborations and attract visiting students and scientists.

"Our immune system is composed of numerous cells and molecules that are patrolling from our blood stream to all organs. When a danger is detected in one organ these cells and molecules enter the targeted organ and start a whole cascade of events to get ride of the danger: be a potential tumor or a microbe. Amongst the white blood cells circulating in human blood, a particular cell type named CD8 T cell plays a key role in controlling microbes. The proposed research program deals with CD8 T cells and aims to determine how these cells are influenced by environmental and intrinsic factors. The factors that are studied include soluble molecules (free-floating molecules), molecules on the surface of CD8 T cells as well as molecules inside these cells. In order to complete these studies various methods will be exploited from tissue culture, molecular biology and flow cytometry. Graduate students participating to this program will gain a diversified training in basic immunology, biology and complex data analysis.  The final goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms from surface interactions to intracellular signaling cascades involved in shaping CD8 T cell functions.

"This proposal describes a recently initiated research program to determine the mechanisms responsible for the association between antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors in gram-positive bacteria with the focus on Clostridium perfringens.

Antimicrobial resistance has become an important worldwide matter for both human and veterinary medicine. Perhaps the most commonly employed mechanism for antimicrobial resistance genetic exchange is the transfer of plasmids between bacteria. C. perfringens is known as one of the most common bacterial causes of food-borne illness in the United States and antimicrobial resistance is now emerging in this organism. Isolates of animal origin constitute a risk for transmission to humans through the food chain. The virulence of C.  perfringens is largely due to its toxin-producing abilities and most toxins are plasmid-encoded. Recent investigations on other pathogens have yielded important insights into physical linkages, on plasmids, of specific virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance genes. The proposed investigations are based on the hypothesis that, in C. perfringens, toxin virulence genes and antimicrobial resistant genes are both co-localized on transferable plasmids. The overall objective is to determine the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and toxin virulence genes associations in C. perfringens. The specific objectives are:(i) to determine the phenotypic antimicrobial resistance of our C. perfringens culture collection, and to sequence the bacitracin resistance genes of resistant isolates to identify if these genes are operon plasmid-encoded, (ii) to investigate associations between antimicrobial resistance genes and toxin virulence genotypes of C. perfringens, (iii) to determine if toxin virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance genes are co-localised on transferable plasmids, and (iv) to identify novel genetic elements involved in bacitracin resistance in C. perfringens. This work is important to understand if the use of antimicrobials can select for transferable specific virulence elements in C. perfringens.

"Individuals with severe disabilities often have difficulties in learning how to use a powered wheelchair. Disabled children, in particular, may encounter additional difficulties due to their limited contact, from birth, with their surrounding environment. They may fail to learn such basic skills such as cause and effect. Obtaining a powered wheelchair is an important goal for these children, as it provides them with greater mobility and independence, increases their self-confidence and decreases the burden on their caregivers. However, training of the necessary skills can often be time consuming, challenging and unsafe. The aim of this research project is to develop a simulator, so that individuals with disabilities can safely learn to drive a powered wheelchair. Users will be seated in front of a large screen where a virtual, three-dimensional scene will be projected. The seat will be fixed to a moving platform, which will provide force feedback. Subjects will control a joystick identical to those used for real wheelchairs. When pushing this joystick forward, the virtual scene will flow giving an illusion of movement. In addition, the platform will move forward and tilt back, in order to provide the same sensation that is experienced during acceleration. The visual and force components will provide a realistic experience of motion. An initial experiment will be devoted to recording the movements of a real powered wheelchair in natural indoor tasks, such as starting, braking, turning, going up and down inclined planes. The data from this experiment will then be used to program the simulator and the virtual scenes. Users will be able to practice basic wheelchair navigation, but also maneuvering in tight places and avoiding obstacles and people in the virtual environment. The simulator will be tested both qualitatively and through the use of focus groups (expert clinicians and users). There are plans to develop a variety of virtual scenarios for training purposes, and of building a second, more portable prototype that can be deployed in rehabilitation centers.","Sant� publique (y compris recherche psychologique li�e � la m�decine)","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Computing and Information Sciences - B",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The increasing complexity in the information and communication technologies being used to support workers is rising in importance as an issue that must be understood and controlled so users can benefit from the variety of new technologies that are becoming available. Mobility is an increasingly important characteristic of professional workers, resulting in a trend towards secure mobile wireless systems for dynamically accessing, updating, and consulting online information. Complex data integration and communication problems are becoming more common as a result of advancing mobile technologies. Issues that can affect the successful implementation of mobile systems include: a) interoperability of multiple systems to which access may be desired, b) the need for personalization to the needs of specific users or user classes, c) the necessity for secure, controlled, single sign-on access to data and information sources, d) the need for highly usable interfaces that can win the adoption and confidence of end users and e) functionalities that support the needs of end-users.  In the healthcare industry, where our main interest lies, the general goal has been to develop interoperable Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to support clinics, hospitals, pharmacies and other points of care. 



The objectives of our research are: 1) To design a framework for wireless mobile access to multiple heterogeneous information sources, using secure and usable access technologies, that provides personalized user support in a healthcare environment; and 2) to develop a mobile prototype system based on the framework that will support a real application, and demonstrate and evaluate it. Our research will pay careful attention to personalization and usability, the use of software agents that are adaptable to the needs of the user and the environment, the use of portals combined with Web services to achieve the necessary interoperability among basically incompatible systems, and privacy and security requirements.

"The process of endosymbiosis has been a monumental force in the origin and diversification of eukaryotic (nucleus-containing) organisms. The primary endosymbiotic origin of plastids (chloroplasts) occurred more than a billion years ago and spawned three lineages-the green algae (and their land plant relatives), red algae and glaucophytes-whose energy-generating capabilities paved the way for a transformation of the biosphere. The photosynthetic organelles of red and green algae have spread to unrelated eukaryotes by 'secondary endosymbiosis'-the engulfment and retention of an algal cell inside a non-photosynthetic host. Secondary endosymbiosis has given rise to some of the most abundant and ecologically significant aquatic photosynthesizers on the planet, including heterokonts (e.g., diatoms and giant kelp) and the 'red tide'-causing dinoflagellates. We are leading a DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI)-funded effort to sequence the nuclear genomes of two secondary plastid-containing algae of pivotal evolutionary and cell biological significance, the cryptomonad Guillardia theta and the chlorarachniophyte Bigelowiella natans. Together, these organisms are unique in that they still possess the nucleus (nucleomorph) and cytoplasm of their algal endosymbionts in a highly reduced and simplified form. The limited coding capacity of the cryptomonad and chlorarachniophyte nucleomorphs indicates that the nuclear genomes of these organisms have been repositories for thousands of endosymbiont-derived genes throughout their evolutionary history. The goal of this project is to (i) spearhead community efforts to 'annotate' the Guillardia and Bigelowiella genome sequences (ii) establish the bioinformatic resources with which to store, manage and analyze our whole genome datasets, and (iii) perform a variety of genomic analyses related to the DOE-JGI project's main goals. Comparing and contrasting the Guillardia and Bigelowiella genome sequences will provide an unprecedented window into the process of secondary endosymbiosis and the integration of their respective hosts and endosymbionts at the genetic, biochemical and cellular level.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","SRO Program - College of Reviewers",2,"SROPJ ","Special Research Opportunity Program - Project","Nova Scotia","Nouvelle-�cosse"
"The Archibald Laboratory uses molecular biological and computational methods to study the genes and genomes of eukaryotic (nucleus-containing) organisms. Our work focuses on the cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes, two highly unusual groups of algae that acquired photosynthesis through a process called 'secondary endosymbiosis'. This occurs when a phagotrophic (cell-eating) eukaryote engulfs a photosynthetic eukaryote and retains its light-harvesting apparatus (plastid), and has given rise to some of the most ecologically significant phototrophs on the planet. In most secondary plastid-containing algae, (e.g., diatoms and kelp), the nucleus of the secondary endosymbiont has completely disappeared, having transferred all essential genes to the nuclear genome of the host cell. However, in cryptophytes and chlorarachniophytes, the endosymbiont nucleus persists in a miniaturized form called a 'nucleomorph', and the endosymbiont-derived cytoplasm (the 'periplasmic space') is retained as the site of essential cellular processes such as DNA replication, transcription and translation. As the coding capacity of nucleomorph genomes is extremely limited, most of the proteins functioning in the periplastid space must be host nucleus-encoded, but the diversity of cellular processes taking place in this unusual cellular compartment are currently unknown. Using a battery of molecular, biochemical and comparative genomic techniques, we will analyze the plastid, periplastid and nucleomorph proteomes of cryptophyte and chlorarachniophyte algae in order to (1) elucidate their true biochemical complexity and (2) understand the extent to which host- and endosymbiont-derived proteins have contributed to the molecular machines now functioning in both the host and endosymbiont cytoplasmic compartments. This research will provide insight into the minimal molecular machinery required to sustain core eukaryotic cellular processes and, more generally, shed light on an endosymbiotic process that has given rise to countless species of secondary plastid-containing algae on Earth.

"Most humans learn their native language with apparent ease. Clues about the mechanisms involved in this mini-miracle may come from studying children who struggle to learn to talk despite otherwise typical development. Such children, however, do not form a cohesive group. They have difficulty with varying aspects of language, in diverse circumstances, and at different stages of development. The proposed research program aims to improve our understanding of the complex basis of language learning by examining the interdependency of two cognitive systems, working memory and the developing linguistic system. Working memory is the cognitive workspace, the capacity to store and manipulate information within the current focus of attention. It has been suggested that working memory plays a role in language learning. For example, each time a child repeats a new word while pausing to examine a novel object, working memory is at work. If there are limitations in the speed or capacity of working memory, language learning may be constrained as may learning in nonverbal domains. As children learn language, however, they gain an understanding of linguistic rules, which then provide the structure for further language learning. Children having trouble grasping the linguistic patterns in their native language may have difficulty learning the form and meaning of language. Thus, some of the differences among children with language impairment may be because the problems stem from different core deficits potentially in working memory or linguistic development. If this is the case, these children should perform differently on working memory and linguistic tasks, and they should have distinct language and general learning characteristics. My work explores whether specific deficits in working memory versus linguistic knowledge exist in children, and how these groups may differ in the learning of both language and nonverbal information. The results will provide insight into the fundamental processes involved in language learning. As well, the research will help to improve our understanding of communication disorders in children providing a new approach to their identification and remediation.

"ABC transporters have been found in all living organisms and form one of the largest characterized protein families.  Organisms that live in diverse environments and that must adapt to various external conditions have a large repertoire of ABC transporters (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans chromosomes encode 60 ABC transporters) while organisms that occupy a more restricted growth niche have considerably less (e.g., Trypanosoma brucei chromosomes encode 21 ABC transporters).  ABC transporters are integral to many cellular processes, yet little is known of these proteins in parasitic nematodes.  In farm animals and humans, nematodes cause disease, death and economic loss.  Essential to their survival are transport mechanisms, which include ABC transporters.  All anthelmintics currently used to treat nematodes target transporters.  Some ABC transporter gene sequences have been identified in parasitic nematodes however, functional studies do not exist.  The long-term goal of the research is to understand ABC transporter mediated drug resistance in nematodes.  Before this can be accomplished, the basic knowledge of ABC transporters in parasitic nematodes must be expanded.  To do this Brugia malayi, a nematode that resides in the lymphatic system of humans, will be used as the model organism.  The specific goals of the research are to (1) use bioinformatic and genomic analyses to identify and classify the Brugia ABC transporter superfamily; (2) create a spatial proteome of Brugia transporters by transfection of C. elegans with parasite genes; (3) determine the expression patterns in all sexual and life cycle stages using quantitative RT-PCR; and (4) determine the substrate specificity and transport kinetics of Brugia transporters using site-directed mutagenesis and binding assays.  The research has implications for expanding the basic knowledge of ABC transporters in parasitic nematodes and providing insight into their cellular functions.  As many ABC transporters are targets for anthelmintics, this research will suggest new or alternative control strategies and also expand the existing knowledge of the mechanism of resistance to anthelmintics.

"The layout of integrated circuits on chips and boards (physical design) is one of many interrelated complex tasks in VLSI circuit design. A major portion of the research in the area of design automation has been devoted to the development of efficient and easy-to-use systems that support circuit layout. Today's embedded systems contain various combinations of different components in the form of microprocessors, memories and application specific integrated circuits (ASICS). All this cannot be achieved without advanced and suitable CAD tools including physical design automation. The interconnect delay in VLSI circuits has become a critical determiner of circuit performance. It seems to become more and more important to know the impact of interconnection on speed and power consumption early in the design trajectory of high-performance processors and Systems-on-Chip. As a  result, circuit layout is starting to play a more important role in today's chip designs. 

Advances in process technology are driving the convergence of communication, computing, and sensor technologies onto a single silicon substrate -- Systems on a Chip (SoC). SoC will change the way future civilian/military systems are conceptualized and designed. Opportunities created by this development for electronic companies are clear, but with these possibilities also come significant design issues that have to be addressed and grand challenges that must be solved. The proposed approach seeks to achieve the following milestones: (i) integrate mathematical based methods with advanced meta-heuristics to solve the underlying hard optimization problems in circuit layout for Systems-on-Chip effectively and efficiently, (ii) reduce the

tremendous complexity associated with System-on-Chip design by utilizing hierarchical/multilevel optimization approaches, (iii) tackle the low power design problem by considering it early and within physical design sub-problems, (iv) speedup the algorithms developed using special hardware accelerators for partitioning, placement and routing.

"The energy crisis and climate change issues have created an urgency to find clean, cheap and renewable sources of energy.  New technologies, such as photovoltaics and solid state lighting are attracting renewed interest and hectic investment rates.  The main competitive factor for these emerging technologies remains costs.  Concentrated solar cells and light emitting diodes are made of sophisticated compound semiconductors that are produced by a technique called epitaxy, which consists of depositing highly ordered films on crystalline substrates.  The cost of epitaxy being one of the main component of a device's final production cost, there is an urgent need for innovations in that field.  The proposed research program will set the theortical basis for the design of new generation of epitaxy tools.  We will use different numerical approaches, such as finite element modeling, to reproduce the conditions prevalent within the tool.  These model will then be used in conjunction with optimization algorithms to develop innovative version of several key components of the epitaxy tool, such as gas injection, sample heating, and reaction chamber design.  The project will establish a strong basis for the development of epitaxy tools at the Universti� de Sherbrooke and help propel the area into international arena in the fields of new semiconductor applications like photovoltaics, semiconductor-based light sources, and high speed electronics.

"Operator algebras are the response by mathematicians (mostly John von Neumann, initially) to the development of quantum mechanics. Physicists found themselves using ""mathematical"" objects that somehow were natural but that did not make sense from the point of view of the then known mathematics. The algebras studied by von Neumann did not satisfy the initial goal of setting the framework for quantum mechanics, but surprisingly they achieved way more than that. During the last 50 years operator algebras have provided insight  into areas as varied as quantum field theory, knot-theory, quantum computing, and logic, among many others. 



All the nontrivial examples of operator algebras are infinite-dimensional, and thus highly non-intuitive. Throughout the years researchers have used many tricks and points of view to understand these huge objects. One of these points of view is that of studying their enveloping structures: sometimes an object cannot be looked at explicitly, but it can be seen within a bigger object that has better properties. For C*-algebras, some of these objects are the multiplier algebra, the local multiplier algebra, the regular montone completion, and the injective envelope. My research program investigates these last three enveloping structures. 



A second branch in my research program is the study of the Schur-Horn theorem. This theorem is a well-understood result for matrices, but its generalizations to operator algebras have proven to be nontrivial. A simple way to state the Schur-Horn theorem is that it characterizes the diagonals of self-adjoint matrices. A corresponding result for normal operators (even finite-dimensional!) is an open question. This kind of question fits nicely in my program of studying joint majorization of commuting families of self-adjoint operators in II_1 factors.

"Visual shape perception is fundamental for effective interactions with our environment and to recognize objects. This proposal is part of our ongoing long-term project of uncovering how the human visual system processes and represents shape information. Our previous studies have shown that two representation formats (or codes) are involved in the perception of simple shapes. One is based on global shape features such as aspect ratio, curvature, or symmetry. Another is based on the visible surfaces of the object that are delimited by its edges. Two main goals of this proposal concern these codes. Specifically, we wish to establish, for a variety of global shape properties, whether their representation is invariant to depth rotations and if so, what is the depth information required to support this invariance. Regarding the surface code, the proposed experiments will examine to what degree it is distinct from a representation of shape that exclusively rests on its edges, and whether it is invariant to rotations on the picture plane and in depth. A third main goal of this proposal is to explore the perception and representation of complex objects; i.e. those that can be segmented in two or more parts. Our previous investigation of complex objects has shown that their perception involves two separate mechanisms, one concerned with the shape of parts and another with their spatial arrangement, or configuration. We now propose to examine whether the representation of parts in complex objects uses the same global feature and surface codes we have demonstrated for simple objects. We will also examine the perception of the configuration of complex objects. Specifically, we will examine the properties of objects that make the perception of configuration more or less difficult as well as the factors that affect our capacity to discriminate objects on their configuration.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"We herein request a gas chromatograph coupled to a chemical ionization mass spectrometer. This instrument will be essential for our field and laboratory research programs at McGill University and Universit� de Montr�al.  Both our research groups have collaborated previously and have jointly published on (a) mercury chemical transformation and analysis, as well as (b) organic-metal interactions. We have acquired the skills and experience to utilize the requested instrument efficiently. This equipment will be pivotal for our short and long-term research in the realm of atmospheric and biogeo-chemistry with a focus on mercury chemical speciation and metal-organic interactions. 

We will deploy the requested instrument in two research programs in our labs. The first axis of research involves detailed chemical characterization of reactive gaseous mercury in atmosphere and oxidized mercury at interfaces of snow/water/air, as well as kinetics and dynamic experiments on trace metal transformations. Mercury is amongst the top-identified contaminants in the environment and has been recognized as a toxic agent by the international advisory boards (EPA-823-F-98-009). The lack of ability to characterize mercury chemical speciation (e.g. the detailed chemical structure) is one of the most important challenges constituting a major gap in the understanding of mercury cycling. Using the requested instrument, in combination with our recent innovation, we would be able to address the major gap in chemical speciation. By ameliorating the technique and adopting it for various environmental conditions, we will perform real time mercury and mercury-containing particles analysis in air, snow, and in aquatic systems, providing a niche for Canada in the domain of ultra-trace metal speciation. The second theme of research will involve bioaerosol chemistry. Bioparticles can interact with solar and terrestrial irradiation, while also serving as seeds for cloud nucleation. This instrument will allow us to conduct targeted studies to decipher the chemical processes that yield to nucleation of organic aerosols. 12 students and postdoctoral fellows will be directly trained using this instrument, and they will contribute to this area of research in atmospheric and biogeochemistry in Canada.

"The project is devoted to an area lying on the crossing of Algebraic Geometry, Representation Theory and Homological Algebra. The goal of the project is to unify the existing semi-infinite cohomology theories both in Algebra and in Geometry, in one uniform algebro-geometric and homological setting, to provide comparizon theorems between semi-infinite homology theories and to interpret the known results in Quantum Cohomology from the point of view of Geometry and Topology of algebro-geometric loop spaces.



The first part of the project addresses detailed algebro-geometric investigation of the semi-regular bimodule over semi-simple and affine Lie algebras. This object appears to posess highly non-trivial structures and to be connected to various aspects of geometry of finite dimensional and affine flag varieties. We propose series of conjectures explaining the connection of the semi-regular bimodule with the Chiral Algebra of differential operators on the loop group and with the Chiral Hecke algebra constructed by Beilinson and Drinfeld. Both the Chiral algebra of differential operators on the loop group and the Chiral Hecke algebra play important part in Local Geometric Langlands Correspondence.



The second part of the project is devoted to natural construction of a version of Floer Cohomology for algebro-geometric models of loop spaces with values in a projective variety. We propose a sheaf-theoretic definition of Floer Cohomology. In the case of flag varieties we formulate the conjectural connection of algebro-geometric Floer Cohomology with equivariant quantum cohomology of Givental and Kim.

"There is a continuous demand for reducing the time and cost required to generate geo-information from geo-data acquired from air-and space-borne sensors. The acquisition and processing time is becoming critical for situations, such as emergency response, fire fighting, traffic and environmental monitoring, where the conditions, events and phenomena are continuously changing in space and time. The availability of rapid mapping, monitoring and tracking systems and technology will contribute to reducing this ""waiting-time"" by providing the required data and information to support on-time knowledge-based decision-making. This research proposes an approach aiming to reduce both the acquisition and processing time by developing a flexible aerial platform carrying imaging and ranging sensors and by developing methods for mapping, change detection and tracking. Aerial data collection is still a way to obtain better perspective and coverage over an area and also has the ability for targeted coverage at flexible visiting times. Traditional air-surveys have certain limitations, such as high mobilization costs and flight restrictions. The emerging low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) will be used to develop an unmanned aerial mapping system (UAMS), consisting of the aerial vehicle equipped with GPS/INS navigation systems coupled with imaging and ranging sensors, such as still and video camera and LIDAR. Methods and technology will be developed to extract metric and thematic geo-information from the UAMS acquired data. Monitoring and tracking research will involve the integration of existing data and information in the estimation process for change detection and the use of video image sequence to monitor and track fast-occurring spatio-temporal events/phenomena. The results of this research are expected to contribute to time-critical operations such as emergency response, environmental monitoring, ecosystems monitoring, fire fighting, search and rescue operations, and traffic monitoring. They will also support application oriented mapping, such as pipeline monitoring and precision farming.

"In the last few years, we have constructed Finite Volume numerical Methods (FVM) of ""Central type"" for nonlinear systems of Hyperbolic equations and Conservation Laws (HCL), extending to 2 and 3-dimensional FV Methods the Lax-Friedrichs and Nessyahu-Tadmor 1-dimensional difference schemes.These methods share the advantages of simplicity and robustness, as they do not require the time-consuming resolution of Riemann Problems; we obtained very good results for problems in transonic / supersonic compressible flows and Aerodynamics. 

More recently, we have adapted these methods to the numerical resolution of problems in Combustion / Detonation and Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).

In the next five years, we intend to improve and extend our methods to more delicate problems:

1. For Transonic / Supersonic compressible flows and problems in Computational Aerodynamics involving Moving Geometries, we shall try to apply overlapping unstructured grid ""Chimera"" methods coupled with our Central FVM, and develop an efficient Parallel Computing algorithm.

2. For the numerical simulation of Combustion and Detonation waves, we shall (i) pursue our construction of Central FVM with explicit/implicit Runge-Kutta -type Predictor-Corrector time discretisation, (ii) improve our new Artificial Compression Method (ACM) with Discontinuity Detector, (iii) extend this to 2-D Unstructured grids, and try to obtain a good capture of Detonations even with ""Under-Resolved"" Calculations, (iv) further study and extend to 2-dimensions our Multi-Scale Method.

3. In MHD, to solve, in arbitrary domains, problems in Astrophysics and Plasma Physics (joint work with C. Klingenberg, F. Niemeyer, T. Amari) we shall extend to Unstructured Triangular / Tetrahedric grids our recent FVM for MHD, which gave excellent results for 2 / 3-D Cartesian grids. We shall compare our method with methods based on the HLLC Riemann solver, and Bouchut's new positive, entropy stable solver.

"Every organism, whether a human or a single cell, has the ability to adapt its metabolism between times of feast and famine. Abundant nutrients enable energy stores to be laid down and later released when times are lean. Cells and organisms efficiently respond to nutrient abundance by altering the operation of their metabolic pathways through the rapid and reversible activation of key enzymes that are turned on or off in response to nutrient signals. One such enzyme in mammals is called AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), that responds to cellular ATP/AMP levels, turning energy consuming metabolic pathways off or on to preserve a constant energy level. Our studies focus on the evolutionarily related yeast AMPK enzyme, SNF1 kinase, which responds similarly to glucose levels, its favorite energy source. This simple yeast system will be used to explore the molecular regulation of this enzyme family. We find that SNF1 kinase has a small protein called ubiquitin (Ub) attached to it, which may affect its stability, cellular location, and activity, all processes that could readily contribute to regulation of this enzyme. Phosphorylation of SNF1 kinase and nuclear localization are required for activity, but the molecular mechanisms controlling these events remain unknown. To shed light on the enzymes and potential triggers that cause attachment of Ub to SNF1 kinase, and the result of that attachment when the glucose supplies change, we will examine changes to SNF1 kinase protein levels, nuclear localization using fluorescent protein tags and microscopy, and metabolic adaptation to different sugar sources when we block SNF1 kinase ubiquitination. Elucidating the role of Ub in SNF1 kinase function may provide insight into how human metabolism is regulated. Inefficient metabolism contributes to metabolic syndrome, encompassing diabetes, obesity, and accelerated heart disease. This is rising in prevalence and affecting increasingly younger people in Canada. Two agents that enhance AMPK activity (exercise and Metformin) improve metabolic efficiency, suggesting that our findings have the potential to greatly benefit human metabolism.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan
"    )	My objective is to examine ancient glacial sedimentary rocks exposed in Canada and Alaska in order to better understand the nature of climate change during the Neoproterozoic and Cenozoic time periods.  Changes in rock characteristics (physical and chemical properties) will be analysed to determine the environmental conditions that existed at that time.  This research will focus particularly on distinguishing between evidence of climate change and evidence of tectonic activity as these two factors can leave very similar 'signatures' in the geologic record.  In addition, I will examine glacial deposits of Quaternary age in the Waterloo and Oak Ridges moraines of southern Ontario in order to study the types of features left by deformation near an ice margin.  This will in turn help to evaluate the significance of deformation features observed in ancient glacial deposits elsewhere.","Sciences de la terre","Avancement des connaissances","Solid Earth Sciences",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"This research will examine the design of alternative methods to use transition metal catalysis in issues of importance to chemical synthesis.  These range from pharmaceutically relevant product synthesis, new classes of polymers, environmentally friendly (Green) reactions, and efficient access to chiral compounds.  The specific issues that will be examined are:

      One Step Synthesis:  We propose to use metal catalysis to develop simple, ""one step"" methods to assemble biologically relevant core structures directly from available building blocks.  Because of their efficiency, these will be not only be straightfoward to perform, but also minimize waste, and can prove useful for creating new variants of bio-active compounds.  These reactions will both be developed, and applied to the construction of important pharmaceutically relevant products.  

      Catalytic Multicomponent Polymerizations:  We propose to develop catalytic approaches to assemble complex polymers in a similar fashion to high volume polymers:  by in this case assembling several simple monomers together at once via catalysis (a multicomponent polymerization).  This can provide a method to access complex polymers in a practical fashion.  These studies will be directed towards generating new classes of conjugated polymers, as well as polymer libraries to tune their properties.

      Modular Approaches to Asymmetric Transition Metal Catalysis:  While asymmetric catalysis provides an efficient route to construct chiral building blocks, the identification of the correct chiral ligand for high selectivity is a significant challenge, since each ligand must be synthesized.  We propose to design an alternative to synthetic chiral ligands, which instead uses receptor ligands that can simply hydrogen bond with ""non-synthetic"" and chiral amino acids. These can be easily modified without synthesis, creating a system well suited to tune for high selectivity.

"In our everyday lives we must often perform two tasks at once, or attend to more than one stimulus at a time. For example, we may talk on our cellular phone while driving, or take notes while listening to a lecture. Many of the tasks we try to perform in combination require attention. At odds with our desire to do everything at once is the fact that there are finite limits on how much information we can attend to and process at any one time. Such attentional limitations are frustrating in that they often predict the imminent failure of one or more tasks under conditions of multi-tasking even when two tasks do not share the same input (e.g., eyes) or output (e.g., hands) systems. However, our failures in multi-task situations can provide valuable information concerning functional and fundamental human processing limitations on attention. 

To examine the nature and duration of attentional processing limitations in dual-task paradigms, I present two different discrete targets each requiring a simple response, and manipulate the nature of the targets, the nature of the target tasks, the separation between the targets, and the presentation conditions. Electrophysiological recordings are also taken while participants perform dual-task conditions so that the pattern of electrical brain activity in response to the targets can be examined. The nature and duration of attentional processing limitations are inferred from the pattern of behavioural responses (response time and accuracy) and the brainwave components (amplitude and latency) that relate to specific cognitive processes. 

I also seek to understand dual-task costs by examining why some individuals show larger multi-tasking costs than others. Participants perform various cognitive tasks under single task conditions. Some of these tasks are simple such as pressing a button when viewing a letter, but others are more complex such as reading, memory tasks, or problem solving tasks. The level of performance on these tasks is then related to performance costs on the dual-task trials. Strong relationships between single-task performance and dual-task costs suggest a common underlying cognitive process. Electrophysiological techniques are then used to isolate this process.

"Many of the world's ecosystems have been altered by human activities, often resulting in severe environmental impacts, with declines in biodiversity frequently identified as one of the most serious repercussions. Ecologists are, therefore, faced with the challenge of predicting how ecosystems will respond to environmental change. Local factors such as competition, predation, and environmental conditions clearly play an important role in structuring communities. However, over the past decade there has been a paradigm shift, with ecologists becoming increasingly aware of the important role that dispersal plays in shaping community composition. Dispersal of individuals among habitat patches can provide an increased source of both species and genetic variation that enable communities to respond to environmental change.

    )	The goal of my proposed research is to examine the role that dispersal plays in the maintenance of species diversity, particularly in the face of environmental change. My students and I will conduct 4 new studies: 1) Zooplankton colonization success in lakes recovering from acidification; 2) The influence of landscape heterogeneity on zooplankton diversity; 3) The role of dispersal in community response to environmental change, and 4) The role of dispersal in adaptation of populations to environmental change.  To do this, we will use a combination of approaches: field mesocosm experiments, landscape surveys, whole-lake manipulations, paleolimnological techniques, and molecular genetics. Our work will be conducted at several field sites, including Wapusk National Park, Killarney Provincial Park, and Queen's University Biological Station. 

The role of dispersal in the ability of biological communities to respond to environmental change remains largely unexplored. Although theoretical models and laboratory studies have provided insights into the role of dispersal in maintaining community structure and ecosystem functioning, few field-based studies have been conducted. This proposed research will use broad, landscape-level studies and field experiments to examine the role of dispersal and landscape heterogeneity on community structure.

"Molecules are the building blocks of everything we breathe, drink or eat. However, until very recently, the detection of a single molecule was more fiction than science. The present proposal is about receiving the fingerprint signals from a single molecule using metal nanoparticles as transmitters.  The detection of single molecules is achieved with metallic nanostructures of silver and gold, and a great deal of effort is dedicated to the fabrication of such structures and to the study of their optical properties. Thus, the first step in this project is the fabrication of silver or gold nanostructures (about 100 times bigger than the molecule under investigation) used in the detection of molecular species. In addition, if we can detect one, it would be easy to detect a bunch of them and we are developing analytical protocols to detect very small amounts of molecules using the same method. The latter is known as trace analysis, and can involve the detection of small amounts of pollutants in the environment, contaminants in pharmochemicals, or the detection of micro-organisms and toxins.  The potential for applications is so evident that the race for patenting specific detection systems is on, and many small companies are flourishing profiting from trace analysis. In this research proposal we explore two techniques that can provide single molecule detection (SMD) using metallic nanostructures; they are surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF).  We hope to provide pattern recognition for SMD. Therefore, when a single molecule send out information about its environment, or changes in it, a proper interpretation can be given. Developing the methods for SMD is equivalent to finding the ultimate sensor element for applications in biological, chemical and physical sciences. This explains the enormous interest in detecting the signal coming from a single molecule.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Anal. & Phys.

"Our recent work has advanced the understanding of the biologically-mediated mineral breakdown and nutrient cycling in rhizosphere soils (RS) and other terrestrial microenvironments (e.g., lichen/rock interface).  The proposal will provide new information such as magnesium storage in hydroxy-interlayered clay minerals (HIM) - a possible new concept to evaluate the sustainability of non-fertilized soils through manipulation of clay mineral formation.  The main experiments include growth chamber experiments to understand the formation of HIM from primary minerals in RS of common agricultural crops (e.g., barley, alfalfa) and forest species (e.g., hybrid spruce, sub-alpine fir).  Illite, chlorite, mica and feldspars will be mixed with acid-washed Ottawa sand to create the experimental growth medium for each plant.  Soil solution will be collected from the RS using microsuction cups and clay samples will be collected at the end of the growing period.  Rhizosphere soils and lichen/rock interface materials will be collected in several field sites.  Laboratory and field samples will be analyzed for clay mineral composition using x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy.  Other analytical methods include synchrotron radiation (e.g., x-ray absorption spectroscopy) to determine the oxidation state of major elements (e.g., Fe in chlorite and mica), nuclear magnetic resonance and inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometers, and capillary electrophoresis for chemical characterization of soils, rocks, plants and water samples.  Identity of the organisms in RS and lichen/rock interface samples will be determined by 16S rDNA technique while organic acids and soil solution composition will be estimated using capillary electrophoresis.

"Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from coal-fired power plants has been identified as one of the key strategies that

will enable Canada and other nations to significantly reduce their emissions to the levels where Kyoto

Protocol's targets can be achieved. However, adopting the CO2 capture technology to the power plants poses

significant challenges because the absorption-based CO2 capture process requires significant energy

requirement for solvent regeneration and CO2 stripping, thereby making this process energy intensive and

costly. To alleviate such challenges, we propose a new process for energy-efficient CO2 stripping using alcohol

vapor as a carrier instead of water vapor. This process presents a great opportunity for a significant reduction in

energy requirement since it is operated at the temperature lower than that of the conventional process. This

would enable the power plants to make use of their low-quality steam or any other low-quality energy sources

locally available with no or small additional costs. As a result, more efficient heat integration between power

plants and CO2 capture process can be achieved, consequently reducing energy penalty. It is therefore our goal

to explore the promise of this new process by studying detailed fundamentals of alcohol-based CO2 stripping,

evaluating energy performance, developing the most energy-efficient process scheme, identifying the most

efficient approach for heat integration with the power plants, and also evaluating benefits and societal issues

against the conventional process. To achieve these objectives, we plan to recruit five graduate students to be

trained and undertake five tasks; 1) performance evaluation of mass-transfer, 2) development of rate-based

CO2 stripping model, 3) development of energy-efficient process scheme, 4) corrosion evaluation and material

selection, and 5) impact assessment of alcohol utilization. The outcomes of this proposed research are expected

to contribute a great deal to Canada's climate change policy through the reduction in CO2 capture cost, thus

providing an economic incentive to major industry to treat its flue gas before releasing it to the atmosphere.","P�trole, gaz et charbon","Ressources d'�nergie","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan
"Capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial flue gas streams has been considered as one of the key strategies for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada and the world.  At present, gas absorption into an aqueous alkanolamine solution is the most reliable mitigation technique that bears no technical risk for CO2 capture.  However, the current commercial technology is yet associated with high capital and operating cost. The CO2 capture cost can be reduced by enhancing absorption & regeneration performance of alkanolamines used and also by improving column design or configuration of the process. Use of energy-efficient alkanolamines could result in a significant reduction in energy requirement for the process, thereby reducing operating cost. It however leads to an increase in capital cost of the entire capture process. Therefore, it is important that performance of absorption and regeneration columns must also be improved if the overall capture cost is to be reduced. The objectives of this proposed research are: 1) to determine mass-transfer performance and hydrodynamic behavior of various columns fitted with structured packings and also spray nozzles under CO2 absorption and solvent regeneration conditions, 2) to measure energy-flux components taking part in CO2 absorption and regeneration phenomena, 3) to develop a theoretical rate-based model that integrates mass-transfer performance, energy-flux components and hydrodynamic behavior of the columns, and 4) to perform an optimization study to arrive at the optimal design of column internals for CO2 capture application. This research is important because it will lead to significant savings in not only the capital expenditure but also the operating cost of CO2 capture. The research outcomes will present Canada with a great opportunity for reducing its CO2 emissions in a timely manner without posing a burden on the growing economy.

"This research advances a simplified yet theoretically and numerically robust process-based modeling approach to quantify the production, release and transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) from uplands and wetlands, as affected by forest litter type, hydro-thermal ground conditions, and daily year-round weather, and climate change. This proposal originates from our review of recent literature, models and data, and our recent study on DOC, DON and water colour in streams and soil solutions in south-western Nova Scotia. This study revealed as-yet un-quantified seasonal and year-by-year contrasts in upland-wetland DOC concentrations, which peak in upland soil solutions during spring, or summer to fall, or late fall to early winter. Wetland DOC concentrations peak fairly consistently in summer to early fall. The proposed research involves: 1. A 5-year effort, to generate data for DOC-DON modeling for a wide range of litter types and site conditions, to be of use in climate-affected forest biomass, C, and nutrient cycling modeling. 2. A detailed DOC-DON sampling study, accompanied with a comprehensive hydro-thermal assessment for each of the proposed sampling sites (soil moisture, temperature, infiltration, percolation, interflow, etc.), as affected by daily weather, forest cover and ground-cover , and soil-layer attributes such as depth, bulk density, texture, organic matter and coarse fragments. Hydro-thermal projections will be verified by in-situ soil moisture and temperature monitoring and recording. 3. An in-depth review of published DOC and DON production and upland-wetland transport data and models, to allow for a detailed multi-model comparison. 4. A generalized application of the resulting DOC-DON model; this requires the discerning of DOC-affecting flow-path patterns, using the UNB developed process to delineate flow paths and wet-areas, at 10 m resolution or better. 5. Further exploring potential roles of the resulting DOC-DON model in several  research and environmental management contexts.

"Much of our research over recent years has been oriented towards pattern recognition invariant to changes of orientation, scale, 3-D rotations, illumination and other distortions. Here we propose to extend this research and some new approaches. A key concept in many parts of this program is a vector space approach to image representation and processing. The nonlinear locally adaptive correlation filter methods developed to obtain correlation peaks invariant to illumination are being extended to face recognition, and we are extending the vector space approach to change detection in images invariant under local changes of illumination. We are also working in collaboration with industry towards practical applications of some of our previous research using circular harmonic filters for security applications. In collaboration with the defense Department, we will develop the use of correlation techniques along with morphological processing for data mining purposes. Combination of correlation techniques with morphological processing should lead to some more powerful image processing techniques.","Syst�mes d'information et technologie de l'information","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","General Physics",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Our research program focuses on developing and applying the tools of theoretical & computational chemistry to study the interplay between shape and dynamics in flexible molecules. Our approach blends the notions of structure, shape, energetics, and configurational transitions in an original manner: molecules are seen as topological entities, instead of isolated conformers at optimal geometries. By studying how these properties persist under external perturbations, we establish: (i) the stability of molecular shape, (ii) the factors that control the onset of configurational transitions, (iii) the occurrence of new species along reaction paths, and (iv) a measure of dynamic shape similarity for comparing these species.  Molecular shape is conveyed differently depending on scale. For macromolecules, we use chain geometry and topology to monitor configurational transitions in constrained polymers and protein ions. In smaller systems, we focus on how quantum states and electronic structure are affected by external fields or non-adiabatic changes in nuclear geometry. Our long-term goal is to integrate these areas into a single protocol to study the interplay between local electronic properties and global conformational motions in biopolymers. The work projected for the next five years will extend our methods and apply them to the analysis of selected phenomena. The following main themes will be our priorities: (a) Configurational transitions in grafted and externally-driven polymers with distinct topologies.    (b) The stability and unfolding of anhydrous protein ions in conditions that simulate time-of-flight mass spectrometry. (c) Effect of external fields and nuclear geometry on the curvature for reaction paths for electronic processes. The themes (a) and (b) rely on a combination of polymer theory, computer simulations, and our techniques to study chain entanglement. Theme (c) deals with non-adiabatic effects caused by the motions and local fields associated with a protein native state. This latter analysis requires the computation of diabatic amplitudes in coherent quantum states that vary with external fields. I will continue to train HQPs in these areas, and pursue collaborative research with colleagues in Sweden during my sabbatical in 2010/2011.

"Our research will provide a theoretical basis for the understanding of early history of the solar and extrasolar planetary systems, as well the guidance for and the interpretation of new astronomical observations. We will investigate: 

(i) Giant planet growth in a realistic setting of a primordial disk. The most important issue is  to compute the currently poorly constrained growth rate, by including both the gas supply from a realistically modeled (3-D) nebula, and the radiation transfer in an extended, rotating protoplanetary envelope. 

(ii)  Migration of protoplanets in primordial  disks,  which results in the observed distribution of star-planet distances. A new important fast mode of inward and outward migration called migration type III will be studied numerically and analytically. We will use sophisticated hydrodynamical numerical codes run on supercomputers. Our study of planet growth and migration will result in novel perspectives and scenarios of planet formation, and allow putting our solar system in a broader perspective of similar and dissimilar extrasolar cousins.

(iii) Physics and evolution of dust-dominated disks, dust-gas and radiation coupling, including spontaneous axial symmetry breaking in disks of large opacity. Together with studies of planet-disk coupling this investigation will help interpret the types of dust structures found in recent images of young planetary systems. It will be useful  for extrasolar planet searches with new observatories, and provide a diagnostic tools for the presence and distribution in young planetary systems of those components which are notoriously difficult to detect directly: planets, comets, asteroids, and gas. 

(iv) Formation of Kuiper belt and Oort cloud, taking into account the stellar flybys in the star cluster in which the sun has formed, as well as a later instability of the solar system that resulted in the enlargement of the Oort cloud to its current size and the late heavy bombardment of planets by comets.

"Our goal to date has been to develop effective post-harvest preservation methods for fresh fruits and vegetables. One approach that we have been actively pursuing is the intensification of the natural defenses of the plant tissue against diseases and delaying senescence process by hormetic doses of UV-C. One of the defense mechanisms of interest was on the elicitation of antimicrobial phytoalexins in response to hormetic doses of UV-C. In the proposed program, we entertain an integrated approach to elicit not only plant-protecting compounds and other defense reactions but also to accumulate health-beneficial compounds (nutraceuticals) in fresh produce. Since the major roles of plant secondary metabolites are to protect plants from biotic and abiotic stresses, it is conceivable that their levels can be enhanced using this principle. Accumulation of such metabolites often results in plants exposed to abiotic stresses or signal molecules. Thus the objective of this research is to enhance the disease resistance and health-promoting properties of fresh fruits and vegetables through elevating the levels of plant defense and nutraceutical secondary metabolites by post-harvest conditioning with hormetic doses of abiotic stresses and plant signal modulators in a controlled manner. Studies will be carried out initially with carrot which is a long-term storable crop but susceptible to various pathogens; and contains phytoalexins and anticancer compounds, some of which exhibit both activities. Specifically, the research involves: (1) characterization of various abiotic stresses for their oxidative stress intensity as well as profiles of redox signals and hormonal signals, that underlie abiotic stress-induced secondary metabolites, and the determination of the hormetic thresholds of the stresses in selected crops; (2) screening of hormetic doses of stresses and plant signal modulators for their potential to enhance active secondary metabolites; (3) evaluation of cross-interactions between complementary stresses and/or stresses and signal modulators in the enhancement of desirable secondary metabolites; and (4)  evaluation of the dynamics of the disease resistance and titers of the active compounds elicited in response to selected stresses during storage and explore ways to maintain their enhanced attributes. Such a novel approach to the preservation of fresh crops will not only help the fresh produce industry to extend the storability of their crops and reduce post-harvest losses without resorting to chemical programs, but also help them to ensure a healthier population.","Aliments transform�s et boissons","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Plant Biology & Food Science",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"There is much evidence to suggest that repeated exposure to psychostimulant drugs makes animals more sensitive to their rewarding effects and more vulnerable to addiction. However, we have shown that exposure to stimulants during the peripubertal period makes drugs of abuse less rewarding later in life. Because brain development involves a complex interplay of neurochemical, anatomical, and molecular adaptations, it is possible that stimulant administration early in life has distinct neurobiological effects, not yet fully characterized, which may be responsible for a decreased vulnerability to the addictive properties of abused drugs. The proposed program of research will test the hypothesis that there is a period early in life during which exposure to stimulant drugs induces behavioral and molecular changes that are different from those observed in subjects first exposed to stimulants during adulthood. The experiments outlined will investigate the lasting effects that stimulant drugs have on the reward circuitry of developing brains. In all experiments, rats will be pretreated with stimulants or saline (vehicle) during different developmental periods. Later on, brain reward function will be assessed by means of well-established behavioral models and neurobiological methods at the system, cellular, and molecular levels. The identification of specific mechanisms that protect against the effects of repeated exposure to drugs, for example, by diminishing the reward value of drugs, provides a highly promising avenue for developing rational treatments for drug addiction.

"Interactive virtual environments are rapidly growing in many applications from arts and entertainment to scientific simulation, education, and the service industry. Human characters play a significant role in most of these applications. Historically, character animation is done by the traditional technique of key-framing or recently motion capture for more complicated movements. Regardless of the technique, the majority of animated behaviours in interactive or non-interactive multimedia applications are simply play-back of pre-recorded or pre-animated sequences. This inability of the systems to generate realistic behaviours limits the applications in terms of their ability to respond to user interactions in real-time by creating appropriate content. Even in non-interactive applications like animated films, there is minimum support from an intelligent animation software, and automating the process of character animation will reduce the production cost and effort, and provides animators with a more effective and systematic way to generate content. This proposal aims at creating a framework that adds knowledge and intelligence to character animation systems. This will be achieved through behavioural experiments and modeling to understand common human actions including but not limited to facial expressions, simple full-body movements, and more complicated actions such as dancing. The next step of the research will be to develop the software framework that uses the computational power of modern systems and allows using the behavioural models in order to create those actions in real time in a realistic and perceptually valid way. Finally we use the framework to create sample applications particularly educational virtual environments and also computer games and animated films. Major contributions of the proposed research will be the ability to create dynamic actions, freedom from pre-recording massive amount of animation using expensive motion capture equipment and artists, more realistic environments through perceptually valid and ""personalized"" virtual characters, and better understanding of human behaviours such as the effect of emotional state on facial and full-body actions

"This proposal concerns the establishment of a material testing facility at the Simon Fraser University (SFU). Traditionally, SFU did not have a Mechanical and Material Engineering program or any research activity in these mentioned areas. As a result, for the applicants to be able to conduct research programs, setting up a material experimental facility has a high degree of urgency. MTS Landmark 200 Hz Elastomer Test System is the main equipment requested by this application. The device configured specifically for characterizing the dynamic properties of elastomeric materials, components and devices.

"The desire to improve fuel economy in the automotive industry has led to the design of Variable Displacement Engines (VDE), which transmit complicated vibration patterns beyond the isolation capabilities of conventional engine mounts. Therefore, there is a growing demand for simple low-cost fail-safe engine mounts for these new engines. Switchable mounts have demonstrated energy efficiency, lower activation costs and distinct vibration isolation performance. As a result, they offer an attractive alternative choice that meets the isolation requirements of VDEs. 



In order to investigate the optimal range of isolation characteristics in switchable mounts and perform a systematic experimental analysis on the parameters it will be necessary to fabricate a simple, low-cost experimental prototype of this mount to achieve the following objectives: A) To develop models that describe the nonlinearities in each of the switchable mount components. B) To experimentally quantify the effects of the nonlinearity in the dynamic performance of the mount. C) To evaluate models of the switchable mount for high and low frequency regions of excitation. E) To optimize the switchable mount parameters and meet the isolation requirements of the VDEs. F) To fabricate a simple low-cost prototype and investigate the dynamic isolation performance of the proposed switchable mount. 



This project will identify new ways to control engine vibration. The research results will profoundly affect a wide range of transportation industries dependent on locomotion including: automotive, aviation, and maritime applications. It also has many potential applications in biomedical devices. This project will also provide stimulating opportunities for training highly qualified personnel and will eventually contribute to the Canadian economy through the design and development of more efficient, compact, and low-cost isolation solutions.

"Carbon dioxide miscible flooding is one of the most promising methods of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) for light and medium oil reservoirs. Additionally, this process can be utilized as a means of storing carbon dioxide in oil reservoirs and other geological formations, such as deep aquifers. The combination of CO2 EOR and storage provides an attractive and economically viable solution for storage and sequestration of CO2 in partially depleted oil reservoirs. 

        Here a comprehensive research program is proposed aiming at investigating a novel method based on utilizing Bovine Carbonic Anhydrase enzyme as a catalyst for accelerating mineralization and precipitation of CO2 in form of calcium and/or magnesium carbonate in porous media, where CO2 flooding is implemented. The in-situ precipitation of solid precipitants would lead to reduction of the permeability of existing pathways of CO2. Therefore, the subsequent injected CO2 will flow through unswept regions of reservoir. This enhances the volumetric sweep efficiency (i.e. conformance) of CO2 flooding process, which leads to improved oil recovery and increased pore volume available for storing CO2. Furthermore, this enzyme can be utilized for permanent sequestration of injected CO2 in the form of calcium carbonate.

        The goal for this proposed research is to conduct a thorough experimental, and mathematical modeling, research to investigate the effect of various parameters such as temperature, pH, enzyme concentration, permeability of porous media and various operating conditions on the enzymatic mineralization of CO2 at conditions similar to those found in oil reservoirs and/or deep aquifers. The results of this research will be used to develop an optimized process for improving volumetric sweep efficiency of CO2 in oil reservoirs during CO2 EOR projects, as well as a practical solution for permanent sequestration of CO2 in oil reservoirs and/or deep aquifers.

"Cross-sectional sampling is a data collection scheme often used in follow-up studies on duration of a condition when logistic or other constraints preclude the possibility of following-up subjects since initiation of the condition. The condition of interest may be, for instance, a disease, in medical applications, or the unemployment spell in labour force studies. Subjects recruited through a cross-sectional survey have already experienced the onset of the condition of interest, say a disease. Such subjects are known as prevalent cases in epidemiological studies. It is well-known that the duration data collected on prevalent cases are biased. In fact, subjects with longer duration have a greater chance to be included in the sample. A further complication encountered in a cross-sectional survery with follow-up is the issue of informative censoring. This latter feature of cross-sectional surverys, render any direct application of existing methodologies in the classical survival analysis, i.e. analysis based on incident cases, impossible. For, the independence between failure and censoring time plays a crucial role in the martingale machinary used in the classical setting. In addition to the aforementioned features, the data presented to us for analysis have quite a number of other peculiarities which are seemingly shared by many other prevalent cohort studies. Ascertainment of the disease onset is, for example, a great challenge in many prevalent cohort studies. The onset of disease may be completely unknown or, at best, known with uncertainty for many subjects.  Modelling and analysis of covariates is another complicated issue in prevalent cohort studies. While a modification of Cox partial likelihood has been used quite often in application, it is possible to show that the estimators obtained using this model, while consistent, are not most efficient. 

The main theme of this project is to propose appropriate methodologies for analysing prevalent cohort survival data. Each of these methodologies will be tested using simulation studies and applied to the data on survival with dementia collected as a part of a nation-wide study called Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA).

"This proposal relates to the impact of ink droplets on a surface. The project is a collaborative project with Xerox corporation to better understand the mechanism of the ink droplet impact, spread, and adhesion on a drum surface. In Xerox inkjet printers, wax ink is used to form an image on the surface of a drum. The image is then transferred onto a paper. The image quality intimately depends on the drop impact processes and drop adhesion on the drum surface. 

   This project is a continuation of our previous CRD /Xerox  grant. The previous research addressed three major issues related to the droplet deposition on a  drum surface in solid ink printers. The first issue was droplet formation from a pulsed jets generated by solid ink printheads. The purpose of conducting this study was to avoid the deposition of satellite droplets or ligaments on the drum surface and to determine the jetting condition for obtaining consistent droplet generation. Parameters that were varied and tested include working voltages and ejection frequencies. The second issue studied was the deposition of single droplets on solid surfaces. The droplet surface texture and final shape, which include spread diameter, contact angle and height, were correlated with impact conditions. The impact conditions varied include printhead temperature, substrate temperature, distance from printhead to substrate. The third problem covered was the deposition of multiple ink droplets on the drum surface. The study began with the deposition of two ink droplets on the drum surface. We first define two domains considering spread length as a function of overlap ratio of two droplets: drawback domain and no-drawback domain. 

     The present proposal is aimed at developing novel structured impact surfaces, which can control the spreading, solidification time of each drop, as well as coalescence and mixing between neighboring drops. Such surfaces can limit the drawback process between drops, yet provide easy transfer of drops and image from a drum to a paper.

"Atomization is of importance in many industrial processes as well as agriculture, meteorology, and medicine. It generally refers to a process in which a bulk liquid is disintegrated into small drops or droplets by internal and/or external forces as a result of the interaction between the liquid (dispersed phase) and surrounding medium (continuous phase). The disintegration or breakup occurs when the disruptive forces exceed the liquid surface tension force. The consolidating effect of liquid surface tension tends to pull a liquid into a form that exhibits the minimum surface energy, while the stabilizing effect of liquid viscosity tends to oppose any change in liquid geometry. The initial breakup process of a liquid mass into small droplets is often referred to as primary breakup or primary atomization. A population of larger droplets produced in the primary atomization may be unstable if they exceed a critical droplet size and thus may undergo further disruption into smaller droplets. This process is usually termed secondary breakup or secondary atomization. 



At the present time, there is no detailed understanding of the atomization process, due to lack of a proper model. We propose to conduct a joint numerical and experimental study of the atomization process, to develop a proper understanding of this complex process. We will develop a three-dimensional, time-dependent model, which can handle two-phase turbulent flows. Using this model, we will conduct a numerical simulation of the atomization process from the first principals of fluid dynamics. We need to develop and implement a model for predicting the effect of turbulence on liquid-gas interfaces. For this purpose we propose to combine large eddy simulation of turbulent flows with a volume of fluid method for capturing the interface deformation. The use experimental results to further develop and validate the subgrid turbulence models. The experimental study will entail a close-up look at the turbulent interface wave structure and its properties in terms of the flow turbulent characteristics.

"In designing flood-control structures, or in estimating flood damage, decisions are often made on the basis of a short sample of river flow measurements.  A statistical frequency distribution is chosen to fit the measurements, and the fitted distribution is then used to estimate future floods. Many methods exist to fit distributions to data. Some of the distributions have a finite upper bound that is a function of the distribution parameters (shape, scale, etc.). Some distribution fitting methods may produce an estimate of this upper bound that is inconsistent with the observed data. This occurs when one or more sample observations exceed the upper bound of the estimated distribution. This makes the estimated upper bound unrealistic. We will investigate this inconsistency of some estimation methods with the observed data and examine its engineering risk consequences. We hope to establish improved guidelines for choosing between statistical distributions and fitting methods for hydrological risk analysis.

In hydrological design, the joint occurrence of more than one random variable is often involved. For example, the study of urban drainage systems involves the simultaneous consideration of several random variables such as the intensity, duration, and frequency of rainfall events. The frequency analysis of these variables must be based on their joint frequency distribution. We will develop new methods for estimating the joint occurrence probability of more than one hydrological variable and make these methods available to practitioners.

    )	Regional flood estimation procedures are useful for improving flood estimation at an engineering site when there is a lack of river flow measurements at the site (""ungauged site""). In ""regional flood frequency modeling"", ""hydrologically homogeneous"" regions are delineated by grouping ""similar"" river basins together. Needed flood estimates at the ungauged site are then obtained by developing  ""regional frequency models"". We will pursue research on regional frequency models and how to improve them.

  Evolutionary computation is a general purpose optimization and modeling technique that uses a digital analogy to the biological theory of evolution as its basic algorithm.  This proposal both seeks to improve evolutionary computation by exploring the ways in which problems can be represented in the computer and applies evolutionary computation to a variety of biological problems.  These include automatic classification of biological sequence data, exploration of worst cases for the spread of epidemics, novel unsupervised learning techniques for the analysis of biological data, the evolution and analysis of game playing agents used in biological modeling, and the design of error-tolerant embeddable biological markers for use in genomics.  The proposal will involve collaboration with other labs throughout North America including ongoing collaborations with researchers at Simon Frasier University, Iowa State University, Washington State University, and Brock University.  Expected outcomes include the development of tools for the analysis of biological problems, continuing improvement in the methodology of evolutionary computation, and the training of high quality personnel in the form of masters and doctoral students.

"Rivers transport part of their sediment load as bed load - the larger particles that move by rolling or bouncing along the river bed. Bed load is important to river morphology and dynamics because its spatial and temporal variation in rate is directly responsible for the formation of the features, such as pools, bars and islands, which are major elements of the geomorphology of many rivers. Similarly, bed load processes affect river dynamics, such as channel migration and rates of morphological change. This research is intended to contribute to understanding the variables that control bed load flux and, in particular, the way in which particle movement interacts with the morphology as the river migrates and changes its morphology. The goal is to describe the development of river morphology as the outcome of the particle transfer process. This is fundamental to understanding river dynamics and has direct application in mitigating erosion problems, understanding the effects of river processes and flow on in-stream habitat and in restoring rivers altered by engineering. It is difficult to measure the bed particle movement in the field but for gravel-bedded rivers many of the processes and features can be reproduced in small-scale physical models in a laboratory flume. We will use physical models to investigate the controls on bed particle dynamics (erosion/deposition frequency and transport distances) under various flow conditions and different channel morphologies to understand how the morphological features develop from the particle pathways and path lengths and, in turn, constrain those movements. We will measure particle movement using tracer particles and video cameras and use digital photogrammetry and image processing to derive river bed topography, topographic change over time and bed roughness and particle size data. It is possible that bed load transport is completely tied up in the dynamics of the bars and pools of the river rather than moving freely over those features ( as it is often conceived). If so, this creates an entirely new conceptual and theoretical picture of bed load transport processes and river channel dynamics.","Eaux int�rieures",Environnement,"Environmental Earth Sciences",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"The objective of the proposed research is to bring together the fields and virtues of 1) Chromogenic properties of transition metal oxide (TMO) thin films and 2) periodic and non-periodic nanostructuring of these thin films to enhance their properties. TMO thin films exhibit various kinds of chromogenic properties due to their multiple oxidation states and their special structure. Their ability to reversibly change their optical properties under the influence of external electric field (electrochromics), heat (thermochromics) and light (photochromics) is termed chromogenics. This chromogenic performance is found to depend very strongly on the film nanostructure which induces favourable traits required for efficient coloration and bleaching. Hence, the main goal of the work proposed is to establish the correlation between the film nanostructure and the chromogenic performance. The experimental work will focus on the thin film preparation methodology to induce the precise nanostructure and to characterize the chromogenic properties under various external influences. In-depth theoretical modelling work will be undertaken to comprehend the underlying physics of the chromogenci phenomena especially as it relates to nanostructured materials. Both periodically and non-periodically nanostructured TMO thin films will be studied. The knowledge gained from this research will be applied towards enhancing the optical and photonic perforamnce of the films. The non-periodic structures are very interesting from the point of view of their enhanced optical performance while the periodic structures are important for their unique ability to selectively manipulate light propagation (through photonic bandgap).  The reversible and continuous tuning of the photonic band gap is at the heart of the work to be undertaken. Hence, the ultimate goal in both the cases is to achieve an interactive external control of optical and photonic properties of importance in various applications such as smart windows, sensors and optical circuitry. Evaluation of the application potential of the optical and photonic devices based on these nanostructured TMO thin films will be an important aspect to be addressed in the work.

"MADS-box genes are indispensable elements in the genetic programming of pattern formation, including the segmental organisation of angiosperm flowers, in all seed plants.  Thus, MADS-box genes are best known for their roles in regulating the transition of shoot apical meristems into inflorescence and floral meristems and in the determination of floral organ (sepal, petal, stamen and carpel) identities.  They have also been discovered in non-flowering plants including conifers, Gnetum, ferns, a clubmoss and a moss.  In a few cases, it has been shown that specific non-flowering plant MADS-box genes display similar expression patterns to distinct subsets of flowering plant MADS-box genes.  Therefore, discovery of the non-flowering plant genes has raised the intriguing possibility that mechanisms governing the differentiation of reproductive structures, and other important developmental transitions, in higher and at least some lower plants are fundamentally similar and evolutionarily conserved.  To obtain clues about the ancestral functions of genes that are now involved in regulating specialised developmental processes such as the generation of flowers, the research proposed here will determine the roles and expression patterns of the entire complement of MADS-box genes of the moss, Physcomitrella patens.  This plant model system offers unique opportunities for these kinds of study because its entire genome has been sequenced and it is amenable to sophisticated genetic analysis.  The results obtained, when combined with information about this gene family in other plants, should provide a more profound comprehension of the evolution of the MADS-box multigene family and its functions as well as of the evolution of the various major land plant groups and structures, such as angiosperm flowers, which define each of them.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Plant Biology & Food Science",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan

"In time reversal, matched field processing (TR/MFP), the backscatter of a signal transmitted into an environment is recorded, delayed, energy normalized, and retransmitted into the medium. TR/MFP offers an alternative to traditional detectors, e.g. the matched filter in one dimensional signal processing and the matched field processing (MFP) in multidimensions. The difficulty with MFP is that the Green's function used to model the channel is not known and, therefore, has to be computed numerically.  By its inherent nature, TR/MFP intrinsically derives the Green's function of the channel as long as the receiving transducer array provides an adequate sampling of the channel.  A second advantage of TR/MFP lies in the productive treatment of the channel multipaths. As is generally known, multipath significantly affects the performance of traditional detectors and is considered to be a detrimental and a negative whose effects should be minimized. TR/MFP presents the opposite opportunity: multipath as a positive, the more the better.  Though the technique of TR/MFP is not new, but a thorough theory of detection for this setting is lacking.  Our initial work addresses this gap and proves analytically, we believe for the first time, the phenomena of super resolution focusing observed with TR/MFP. In this proposal, we seek to extend this analysis further to provide quantitative answers to the following questions: How can TR/MFP be used in classical signal processing applications, such as: (i) target detection in a rich cluttering environment; (ii) channel capacity enhancement and equalization in wireless communications by some form of space division multiple access (SDMA); and (iii) inverse tomographic problems to determine channel characteristics, to name a few. We will also investigate how good TR/MFP is for target localization, tracking, and identification?  What are the fundamental limits of TR/MFP?  How stationary does the channel have to be for accurate TR/MFP?

"The Canadian mining industry is faced with ever-increasing complexities due to intense global competition. The Canadian mining industry with the perspective of enormous investments in the Alberta new oil sands projects and the diamond industry needs to push the limits of technology by innovation. Mining and mineral processing are generally viewed as separate functions within the design and planning of a mining complex. Optimization of each stage is generally carried out in isolation without regard to interdependencies among the components. Separate optimization of each stage does not guarantee that the overall process is optimized. In complex mining operations, small deviations from the optimal strategy could result in the loss of millions of dollars. The key aim of this research is the optimal integration of mining and mineral processing systems. The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop an intelligent framework for optimal mine planning and mineral processing design. The outcome of the research is expected to lead towards seamless integration of optimal mine and mineral processing engineering design. The overall result is to lower energy costs and increase efficiency in all phases of mining and processing through better control over production processes. The contributions of this research would be a methodology that maximizes the net present value of the mining operation while enforcing the optimum plant feeding conditions, which will spur growth and competitiveness in the Canadian mining industry. The primary benefit of this proposal will be for Canadian companies and the energy sector, which will directly affect the consumers.","Ressources min�rales (prospection, exploration, mines, extraction et pr�paration)","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","Civil Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"Cornell's Laboratory for Elementary Particle Physics hosts the CLEO-c experiment, which over the last five years, has collected data near the charm production threshold. The CLEO collaboration consists of 22 collaborating institutions among which Carleton University has been enumerated since 1993. Professor Asner now leads the Carleton group on CLEO and is currently one of the two elected Spokesmen of the collaboration.

      The full data sample, now almost completely in hand, will consist of over 10 million D mesons - a particle containing a charm quark and an anti-up or anti-down quark, approximately 1.2 million Ds mesons - a particle containing a charm quark and an anti-strange quark - and 27 million psi mesons - which contain a charm quark and an anti-charm quark. These unprecedented ""charm"" data samples were collected in the superb CLEO-c detector, which provides excellent electromagnetic calorimetry, charged particle tracking and identification, and near 4pi solid angular coverage.

      The intellectual merit of the CLEO-c physics program stems from its impact on heavy flavour physics which includes the study of charm and the theory of the strong force QCD - quantum chromodynamic. Also, the CLEO program will enable numerous other measurements that will deepen our understanding of D and Ds meson phenomenology. 

      Professor Asner's team is spearheading the studies of strong and weak phases in charm transitions. These results contribute to our understanding of matter-anti-matter oscillations and asymmetry.

      These results will substantially extend the reach and understanding of heavy flavour physics, allowing the Canadian particle physics community to reap the benefits of their investment in the CLEO-c, BaBar, CDF and D0 experiments which are hosted by laboratories in the USA. The world community will benefit as results from CLEO-c will extend the reach of the Belle experiment at KEK (Japan) and LHCb experiment at CERN (France) and lay the foundation for the physics program of the BESIII experiment in China.

"This research program proposes to investigate the following three areas:

1. High temperature/high pressure electrochemical methods.  This will include the construction and qualification of an electrochemical apparatus capable of aqueous media potentiometric measurements from 25 to 400C at pressures of up to 30 MPa (4400 PSI).  Electrochemical measurements are rare in high temperature aqueous systems yet they are essential in developing a fundamental understanding of leaching and corrosion processes.  This work is particularly suited to investigations in the metals processing, aqueous processing and nuclear industries, all of which are key areas of activity in the Canadian economy.

2. Thermochemistry of the nickel-ammonia-water system at high temperature.  Ni leaching from ammoniacal solutions is industrially practiced in the Canadian metals processing industry, however, not much is known about this system's behaviour above 200C.  This portion of the proposed test program will seek to measure new thermodynamic data for soluble nickel-ammonia complexes above 200C.  This effort is aimed at developing an understanding of the corrosivity and leaching capabilities of ammoniacal ammonium salt solutions at high temperature.

3. Degradation of materials in high temperature aqueous systems.  This part of the program will identify suitable materials for use in high temperature and pressure ammoniacal environments.  Detailed electrochemical studies are planned to shed light on the breakdown of protective films in these environments.  The possibility of metal recovery from ores in high temperature ammoniacal solutions will also be explored.

"Recognition, maintenance and termination of pregnancy are complex processes involving both maternal and embryonic signals. In the rodents during early implantation, endometrial epithelial cells undergo apoptosis. Later, the stromal cells undergo decidualization, which is followed by decidua basalis (DB) regression, involving apoptosis of decidual cells. At the end of pregnancy, a tightly controlled production of prostaglandins is necessary to induce parturition. However, the molecular mechanisms governing endometrial cell apoptosis are not yet defined. Interestingly, our laboratory has showed that individual TGF-b isoforms (TGF-b1, TGF-b2 and TGF-b3) are differently expressed in the uterus during rat pregnancy: TGF-b1 and TGF-b2 are present during implantation and DB regression, whereas TGF-b3 isoform is only present during DB and parturition. We have also provided evidence that distinct TGF-b isoforms can activate distinct signaling pathways in endometrial cells, since only TGF-b3 induces phosphorylation/activation of Akt in endometrial epithelial cells. In the pregnant rat uterus, multiple TGF-b isoforms are often co-expressed: how distinct TGF-b isoform-activated pathways integrate, and shift the balance towards cell survival or cell death in the pregnant uterus, is poorly understood. The overall and long term objective of the proposed research program is to examine and understand the regulation of expression as well as the endocrine, paracrine and autocrine activity of the TGF-b isoforms in the endometrium during the three important phases of pregnancy: 1) implantation, 2) DB regression, and 3) parturition. The short term objectives of the current proposal are to characterize the involvement, the mechanisms of action and interactions of TGF-b isoforms in the (i) regulation of endometrial epithelial cell death at the time of embryo implantation, (ii) stromal cell-induced apoptosis during decidua DB and (iii) prostaglandins regulation and secretion at the time of parturition. Information gained from these studies will help to understand the importance of TGF-b isoforms during these critical reproductive situations and will provide important clues for successful establishment, maintenance and termination of pregnancy.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Integrative Animal Biology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Wireless technologies have seen tremendous success over the years and wireless networks have now become increasingly popular due to their fast and inexpensive deployment and their capabilities of providing flexible and ubiquitous Internet access. While the majority of existing wireless networks are still exclusively confined to single hop access, it is the ability of these networks to forward packets over multihop wireless paths which enabled them to easily extend the coverage area. This convenience has led the IEEE 802.11 to emerge from individual homes to large scale deployments in environments covering medium to large enterprises, apartment complexes and housing developments, as well as public area hot spots (e.g., airports, highway rest areas, coffee shops, etc.). As more users depend on such networks as their primary source for Internet access, there is an increasing expectation that these networks should provide reliable and high end-to-end throughput. Unfortunately, achieving good multihop throughput has been challenging due to factors, such as lossy wireless links caused by interference from concurrent transmissions, and intra-path interference caused by transmissions on successive hops along a single path.  The proposed work will provide a fundamental understanding of the capabilities and limitations of multihop and wireless mesh networks and will present solutions to improving their capacity through improving the spectrum spatial reuse and using smart antennas. We will therefore develop practical algorithms with strong theoretical foundation which will achieve significant performance improvements for multihop and wireless mesh networks that are essential for providing reliable wireless access to the Internet.

"The integrity of the human musculoskeletal system can be compromised with excessive and/or abnormal loading during dynamic activities. Knee osteoarthritis (OA), the progressive degeneration of the knee joint, has been particularly associated with mechanical factors during gait and is one of the main causes of disability across the world. Modern gait analysis is an established method of measuring the mechanical and neuromuscular factors of knee OA, but commonly used inverse dynamics modeling with gait data calculates only net resultant forces and moments at a joint, not accounting for force contributions from muscles spanning the joint. Reported joint forces are therefore conceptual quantities that are not necessarily physically present in any single joint structure. To understand the destructive pathways of knee OA and other diseases of the musculoskeletal system, it is important to determine accurate joint contact forces. This can be achieved by combining gait and electromyography data with more sophisticated modeling and optimization techniques that incorporate behavioral muscle models and more specific joint anatomy. Further, subject-specific musculoskeletal modeling and simulation can combine variations in joint geometry, alignment, muscle activation patterns, and lower limb dynamics to determine the unique biomechanical response of an individual. This will allow biomechanical information to be presented in a more specific, clinically-relevant manner than commonly reported generalized patterns. Simulations of the effects of both conservative and surgical interventions on the models will also provide an efficient and ethical manner of tailoring treatment strategies to an individual.","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Mechanical Engineering - A",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Nova Scotia","Nouvelle-�cosse"

"Computational natural language processing has typically been caught between two complementary forces: 1. the desire for broad coverage, which is useful for natural language technologies like internet search, and 2. the desire for deep understanding, which is useful for natural language technologies like text summarization, translation and dialogue systems. Automated natural language understanding ultimately relies on the development of computational semantics. The work supported by this grant focuses on computational semantics for Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG), a constraint-based theory of natural language syntax. Constraint-based syntactic theories have formed the heart of the deep grammar engineering approach for nearly thirty years.



The LFG grammatical architecture provides a number of unique opportunities for pursuing both theoretical and computational issues about natural language syntax and semantics and the relationship between them. First, the architecture supports hybrid approaches that have the potential to combine advantages of two distinct traditions in how semantic representations are built. Second, LFG's syntactic representations use a rich vocabulary that encodes syntactic cues that are directly relevant to certain important semantic-pragmatic categories, such as presupposition and implicature. The computational treatment of these sorts of pragmatic effects is of growing importance, since they are pervasive in natural language and any system that aims for deep textual understanding must be able to handle them. Third, the long-standing Parallel Grammar and newer Parallel Semantics projects (http://www2.parc.com/isl/groups/nltt/pargram/) not only provide a broader natural community for the research, they also bring to the fore questions of cross-linguistic semantics, which relate the proposed work to machine translation.

"Bioprospecting of plants, based on ethnomedical knowledge, holds out the possibility for discovering new pharmaceuticals. For instance, combretastatins are a group of anti-mitotic agents isolated from the bark of the South African tree, Combretum caffrum. Paclitaxel (Taxol�), an anti-cancer drug, was isolated from the Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia. Enzymes play a significant role in performing various biochemical processes including metabolism, catabolism, cellular signal transduction, cell cycling and development. Any malfunction in these biochemical processes leads to diseases and discomforts. Malfunctioning of biochemical processes is due to the dysfunction of enzymes as well as overexpression or hyperactivation of enzymes. These malfunctions may be corrected by using appropriate enzyme inhibitors. Based on the importance of enzyme inhibitors in human's life, we are interested in discovering acetylcholinesterase, alpha-glucosidase and glutathione S-transferase inhibitors from medicinally important plants. Natural products with these biological activities might have applications in curing Alzhemier's disease, diabetic or improvements of anti-cancer/anti-parasitic chemotherapy. We have collected a number of plants including Artemisia absinthium, Solidogo rigida, Sorbus scopulina, Ribes americanum, Lilium tomentosa, Drypetes natalensis,  Combretum bracteosum, Vepris lanceolata, and Anastrabe integerima etc. from Manitoba and South Africa. All of these plant extracts exhibited enzyme inhibitory and antimicrobial activities in our bench top bioassays. The major objectives of the proposed research are: (i) bioassay-guided isolation of bioactive natural products from medicinally important plants (ii) structure determination of bioactive compounds with the aid NMR and mass spectroscopic methods (iii) structural modifications of bioactive natural products using chemical and microbial reactions to study their structure-activity relationships (iv) detailed in-vitro and in-vivo study of bioactivity of potent bioactive compounds.

"The objective of the proposed research is to develop innovative multifunctional products for acoustics, vibrations and thermal applications in a cost-effective way with recyclable thermoplastic porous/open-celled foams. The overall approach includes: (a) theoretical modeling and designing of acoustic foams with different cellular structure, (b) fabrication of prototype foams with extrusion technology and particulate leaching technique, (c) characterization of prototype foams on their cellular, mechanical, acoustical and thermal properties, (d) correlation of the foams' cellular morphology to their acoustic, vibration and thermal performance, (e) optimization of the design and processing parameters of the foams, and (f) fabrication and performance evaluation of the optimized foam product. The successful accomplishment of the proposed study is expected to have a significant impact on scientific advances and technology improvement on open-cell foaming. The experimental results and the models derived from the research will provide a deep understanding of the correlation between the cellular morphology of the foam and the acoustic and thermal behavior of the foam. Moreover, with the open-cell technologies developed in this project, our industrial partner, the Woodbridge Foam Corporation, will be able to add to their acoustical foam production from non-recyclable PU foams, recyclable thermoplastic foams. This will benefit Canada and the environment by reducing non-recyclable products. In addition, a total of three high quality personnel (HQP) will be trained over the course of the project; they will eventually serve in the Canadian plastics industry and in Canadian research institutions.

"Most adults spend a great deal of time anticipating, planning for, and contemplating the future. Many researchers argue that our capacity for future thought is an important factor that distinguishes us from other species. Yet, little is known about when this capacity develops, and the types of behaviours that reflect it. This research seeks to address these issues through a series of experiments that will test preschoolers' (3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds) ability to make choices in the present in anticipation of events that will unfold in the future. For example, children will encounter an object (e.g., locked box with toy inside) that is missing a necessary tool (e.g., a key). At a later time, children will be told that they will be re-encountering the object and will be given the opportunity to select a tool to bring with them. Of interest, is whether children show the necessary foresight to choose the correct tool (i.e., key). Based on existing developmental theory, I predict that, around age 4, children's choices will evidence an understanding of the future. I will also vary a number of factors to determine how they might influence children's growing awareness of the future. For example, how does children's memory for the original encounter with the object impact their capacity to think ahead? Or, does the amount of delay between when children choose the tool and when it will be used affect children's choices? The answers to these questions will contribute much-needed developmental information to existing theories about future thinking which, to date, have been largely based on data from adults and non-human animals. The results of this research will also be of practical importance. The young child's transition from being predominantly rooted in the here-and-now, to anticipating and planning for the future is of critical importance to healthy development and adaptation. As such, understanding when this capacity develops, and the factors that influence it, will be of direct benefit to parents, early childhood educators, and physicians.

"My research agenda concerns the areas of optimal and experimental design and survival analysis. In optimal design one determines where or when measurements should be taken in order to make the ""best"" inference possible from the data that will be collected. For the purpose of illustration, consider a clinical trial where 50 people are administered a blood pressure lowering treatment. Can we develop designs that will allow us to ""best"" estimate: (i) the proportion of people affected by the treatment, (ii) the timing of the treatment effect and/or, (iii) the before- and after-change average blood pressures. An interesting application of experimental design is in genomics. In the last 20 years many new technologies have been developed for studying our DNA and variations in our DNA that might suggest predisposition to diseases such as cancer. These experiments are often very costly hence their design is a key issue in ensuring that the best quality data possible can be collected. 



The area of survival analysis is concerned with observations of ""lifetimes"" that are incomplete in some way. For example, when following subjects from the onset of their disease some may be lost to follow-up. All that is known for such subjects is that they survived up until they were lost from the study. My proposed research in survival analysis is concerned with observed ""lifetimes"" that tend to be longer than expected because of the way the subjects were selected into the study group. Simply, longer survivors are observed, shorter ones are not, and adjustments in the analysis must be made to accommodate this selection bias. These adjustments help improve our inference and, hence, they have important implications when considering the natural history of a disease.

"The long term objective of the proposed research program is investigation of innovative building-integrated solar energy utilization systems in order to enable the development of energy-positive homes and ultimately commercial buildings. Integration refers to integration with the building envelope, with the heating-ventilation-air-conditioning (HVAC) systems and with lighting. It also refers to simultaneous consideration of electricity generation, solar heating and daylighting, and thermal storage integrated in the building envelope. Effective integration requires an innovative approach to building design and operation in which building envelope components perform several controlled functions such as generating solar heat and electricity in building-integrated photovoltaic-thermal (BIPV/T) systems or transmitting daylight and producing electricity in semitransparent photovoltaic fenestration systems. For both of these examples, there is a need for efficient design and control techniques to utilize effectively the energy produced or the transmitted daylight. The design of the building envelope as a solar energy conversion device will have profound implications on how HVAC systems are designed and controlled since the building itself will be part of the HVAC system and this system will now be an integral part of the solar energy utilization/conversion system. Integration reduces the cost of solar systems and makes them more affordable. The two short-term goals of the proposed research program are 1. For solar homes: investigation of combinations of new promising configurations of BIPV/T, a new concept of an attic-solarium, structural hollow core thermal storage with/without phase-change or other materials and a combination of radiant and convective heating with a small geothermal heat pump; 2. Investigation of innovative concepts for solar facades that combine semitransparent PV, heat recovery, motorized blinds driven by the PV and linked to a hybrid ventilation system.

"Errors in operational software significantly impact both users and software developers, in terms of rework to undo the effects of errors, extra work to avoid or mitigate errors, lost business due to shutdowns or delays in services, and increased customer support. Most of these errors are due to omissions, ambiguities, inconsistencies, or mistakes in the initial specification of what the software is to do, as opposed to design or coding errors introduced during development. Moreover, specification errors become more expensive to correct the later they are detected. 



 Much of my research focuses on modelling and analyzing software specifications to detect errors in the early phases of software development, when errors are cheaper and easier to fix. For the past few years, my research group has been working on developing semantically configurable tools that support multiple modelling notations.  We have developed a way of structuring the definition of a modelling notation such that the definition can be interpreted and used to configure modelling tools, such as model editors and model verifiers.



Continuing this research, I plan to study how to ease the task of configuring the definition of a new modelling notation.  I also intend to investigate whether our work can be adapted to accommodate heterogeneous models, thereby enabling specifiers to combine models written in different modelling notations.  In addition, I plan to explore ways of optimizing the performance of semantically configurable tools.



This research will enable software specifiers to create their own modelling notations - that match the problems they are modelling and that domain experts can read and validate - but still have access to traditional tools for editing, manipulating, and checking their models.  Such technology will ultimately lead to improved software.

"Chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are becoming mainstream, making parallel programming necessary to utilize computational power provided by many cores. However, the grand challenge is to make parallelism pervasive and make it accessible for average programmers. The main difficulty of parallel programming comes from synchronization; concurrent accesses to a memory location should be coordinated to ensure that they do not interfere. This research proposal aims at improving power- and performance-efficiency of synchronization in chip multiprocessors.

  Conventional lock-based programming can lead to deadlock, thread inversion, and other synchronization bugs which do not exist in sequential programs. These synchronization bugs are too challenging for most of programmers. A possible solution for lock-based synchronization is transactional memory (TM). With transactions, the programmer marks regions of a program that should execute atomically, and the runtime system ensures correctness of the application. While the programmer does not need to worry about synchronization bugs in TM, TM results in significant overhead in both hardware- and software-based implementation. Hardware transactional memory (HTM) needs special caches or buffers to keep track of speculative changes to data. These buffers and caches are new features that are not supported by existing hardware. On the other side, software transactional memory uses software support to manage speculative data within a transaction. While STM does not need any changes to existing hardware, it has significant performance overhead which is due to software support for implementation.  

  This research program contributes towards improving power and performance of locks and TMs in chip multiprocessors. While in short term, lock is the dominant synchronization method, TM is an attractive synchronization technique for future CMPs. Nevertheless, both locks and TMs incur significant power and performance overhead, and optimization techniques are required to reduce overhead of locks and TMs.

"Recently, due to the significant increase in various security threats, multimedia surveillance systems are being increasingly used at many public places to monitor/record people's activities and avoid any potential untoward incidents. Although the current-generation surveillance infrastructures have proved to be highly useful from a security perspective; there has been a major apprehension among people in regard to their privacy safeguards. Recent reports also suggests that the privacy concerns have increased. 



It is worth mentioning that although there has been a significant progress in the field of surveillance research, the issues related to people's privacy have often been overlooked in the past and have only begun to attract the attention of researchers very recently. Achieving the goals of security and privacy simultaneously is quite challenging as it requires a mechanism that can automatically determine in real time what to monitor/record for safety purpose and what not to monitor/record for privacy concerns. 



For the effective design and development of privacy-aware multimedia surveillance systems beyond today's state of the art, many interesting research questions related to privacy aware sensory data management, processing, analysis, fusion, and retrieval need to be answered. Building on the applicant's extensive expertise in multimedia surveillance, this research is aimed to investigate scientific solutions to perform effective and automated surveillance keeping the people privacy in tact.

"Computationally intensive computer programs often decompose their data into parts to enable concurrent execution on multiple computers. Many of these programs employ a graph data structure to describe the computation and communication requirements of an underlying mesh, such as for finite element solvers for partial differential equations (PDE). Graph partitioning is the technique used to produce a balanced decomposition of these graphs and achieve a minimization of the communication requirement when the

program is executed on a parallel computer. A number of graph partitioning techniques have been developed, including work by my research group which has created the PaGrid partitioner. This project will contribute new approaches to graph partitioning, both for traditional homogeneous parallel computers and for heterogeneous computer clusters and computational grids. It will also contribute tools to enable the comparative analysis of graph partitioners. 



Mesh-based parallel programs form a large part of the increasing role of simulation in science and engineering. Heterogeneous computational platforms are increasingly unavoidable, with the increasing hierarchical levels of computational resources, from multicore processors to clusters of multiprocessors and mini-grids (clusters of clusters). Heterogeneous graph partitioners such as PaGrid are vital in order to ensure the efficient execution of mesh-based programs on these platforms. This work will strengthen the work already accomplished on PaGrid, and will demonstrate its qualities using benchmark programs.

"Neurons, a specialized type of cells in the brain, fulfill a variety of roles, ranging from the control of movements to cognitive functions.



Our research focuses on fundamental events contributing to the development of a specific kind of neurons, termed cholinergic neurons. Cholinergic neurons release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain and they are involved in mediating critical functions such as learning and memory.



Evidence suggests that certain cell adhesion molecules regulate the development and function of cholinergic neurons. The main goals of our research are threefold. Firstly, we will assess the importance of specific cell adhesion molecules in the development of cholinergic neurons, from newborn cells to mature neurons. Secondly, we will elucidate whether the direct stimulation of given receptors by these cell adhesion molecules results in an increase in cholinergic activity in the brain. Thirdly, we will elucidate intracellular signaling mechanisms by which these cell adhesion molecules control the function of cholinergic neurons.



These studies are important to the basic understanding of cholinergic neuronal development, which requires an orchestration of cellular and molecular interactions to produce this specific type of neurons in the brain.

"The research program described in this proposal will address two topics aimed at solving wastes management problems encountered in the mining industry. The issues relate to the safe disposal of (A) waste rock in large piles following long term accumulation of moisture, and (B) tailings disposed in underground openings as cemented paste backfill.  

 Most of the work done on Topic A has been focussing on the hydrogeological and geochemical behaviour of waste rock piles; little has been done on their geotechnical stability.  The available observations have shown that water accumulation in piles can be potentially very dangerous. The problem needs to be better characterized and understood in order to develop design tools to prevent incidents.  This study will make use of laboratory and in situ data and of numerical tools to investigate the critical hydro-geotechnical conditions that can lead to pile instability; the program also includes the development of control methods. 

The need for a better understanding of the  backfill (Topic B), made with tailings, arises from the major increase in its use in underground mining operations in Canada in recent years.  The available solutions for stability assessment are unable to deal appropriately with major pending issues such as yielding of the fill material under varying degree of saturation when submitted to static and dynamic loadings, the behaviour of the backfill-rock wall interface, the time-dependent progressive strength gain due to cement hydration and curing, and the influence of the filling sequence and of rock mass wall convergence.  These issues will be investigated using tests on backfill samples and results from physical models in the laboratory, data from field measurements in underground stopes, and newly developed numerical and analytical solutions to assess the in situ behaviour of backfill in a more realistic manner.   The investigation will also focus on means to optimise backfilled stope design.

"Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis is a spinal pathology that induces a complex 3D deformity of the trunk, and bracing is the most widely used non-surgical treatment. Best practices of bracing and measurement of brace quality are still questioned. Although Computer Assisted Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software packages can assist with the fabrication of braces, designing a brace is still an empirical process and needs to be specified by a skilled orthotist or orthopaedist.

The objective of this research endeavour is to develop and experimentally assess new patient-specific tools for the optimal design of braces customized to the treatment needs of the patient. The general methodology is two-fold, involving the development of the patient-specific simulation and optimal brace design, and fabrication and experimental validation of the design. The originality of this research project remains the inclusion of an optimisation approach in the rational design of the brace using a patient-specific finite element model of patient's torso, as well as in the personalization of the model using 3D analysis tools allowing the in vivo evaluation of the stiffness of the spine.

We anticipate that optimizing brace treatment will have a direct and positive impact on patients in terms of better and effective brace designs, reducing the number of operated cases and decreasing complications as well. The technological advances will reduce the burden on the Canadian health care system and reduce overall treatment costs, and increase quality of life.

"Cellular membranes have many functions.  They define compartments of living cells and, more importantly, they determine the nature of all communications between the inside and the outside.  Also, membranes control trafficking of molecules, from small nutrients to macromolecules for proper maintenance of cellular functions.  Pathogens, such as viruses and bacterial toxins, must cross cellular membranes to carry out their function.  They have developed mechanisms to deliver molecules, for example genetic material (DNA, RNA) or cytotoxic proteins, inside cells.  Toxins such as diphtheria, tetanus, and botulinum, have been extensively studied, but to date, the mechanism by which their cytotoxic domain crosses the cellular membrane has not been elucidated.  Learning the specifics of protein translocation from these opportunistic molecules will contribute to the knowledge of protein-membrane interactions and will help design new vectors for protein delivery inside cells to investigate cellular function or for therapeutic use.

"Understanding how many and which types of genes and hormones are involved in shaping different behaviours in social organisms is a fundamental goal of behavioural biology. The long-term objective of my research program is to identify the molecular and endocrine mechanisms that underlie social behaviour in vertebrates to further our understanding of the proximate and ultimate causes of behaviour. I study males of Astatotilapia burtoni, a group-living African cichlid fish with strong dominance hierarchies. Goal 1. To study variation among individuals in stress coping styles, also called temperament, to characterize variation in temperament in this species and to invesitigate if bold (low stress response) and shy (high stress response) males also vary in aggressive behaviour and if temperament is stable over time. Moreover, I will explore how hormone levels vary between bold and shy males and which type of genes vary in expression in the brain of males of different temperaments. Goal 2. To uncover the function of genes that vary in expression with dominance in A. burtoni by the use of an integrative biology approach that combines genomics, endocrinology and behaviour biology techniques. I will chemically manipulate the products of these candidate genes and assess their individual and joint effects on behaviour, physiology, hormones, and gene expression. To achieve both goals, microarrays will be used to compare gene expression between samples (bold/shy, control/manipulated male), for thousands of genes at a time. These findings will significantly contribute to fundamental knowledge in the fields of molecular biology, endocrinology and behavioural biology and to applied knowledge in animal husbandry (aquaculture) and species conservation strategies. This research program will make a lasting contribution to Canada as in the long term my findings have the potential to be applied by researchers to the study of behaviour in other vertebrates, including humans in a medical context. It will contribute to training of Canadian highly qualified personnel in the latest molecular biology techniques and to the initiative to put innovative genomics-oriented research at the forefront of life sciences in Canada.

"The control of gene expression requires a task force of protein factors that function coordinately and in combinatorial fashion to turn specific genes on and off. Covalent modifications of these factors by phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation or addition of small proteins such as ubiquitin have long been known to enhance their functional potentials, providing dynamic plasticity to the trancriptional machinery. Sumoylation is an ubiquitine-like modification, which involves the covalent coupling of a small protein SUMO to target proteins and exhibits potential cross-talk with ubiquitin modification. Sumoylation has a role in the control of protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization and regulation of gene expression. We discovered that a so-called KRAB zinc finger protein, ZNF74, that we were studying as a candidate gene for a developmental disorder, the DiGeorge syndrome, and its protein partner called TIF1beta were sumoylated. TIF1 proteins(TIF1s) belong to a class of proteins called TRIM and are co-regulators of KRAB zinc finger proteins (~ 300 members in the human proteome) and nuclear receptors (e.g. retinoic acid receptors), which are transcription factors regulating gene expression. We hypothesize that sumoylation and ubiquitination modulates the transcriptional activity of TIF1s co-regulators and thus affects the regulation of the target genes for KRAB zinc finger proteins and nuclear receptors. Our main objectives are to: 1)Determine the role of sumoylation and ubiquitination on TIF1s gene regulation and 2) Identify and characterize regulatory mechanisms involved in TIF1s sumoylation and ubiquitination. For this second aim, we will take advantage of biophysical assays, called BRET, that we developed for quantitative real-time detection of sumoylation and ubiquitination in living cells. Our longer term objective is to decipher the dynamic interplay between sumoylation and other modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation that occur on TIF1s or other TRIM and are involved in controlling gene expression. This should allow us to better understand how these proteins contribute to initiation, maintenance and termination of silencing or transcriptional activation.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"Biocatalysts are enantio-, chemo-, and regio-selective across a wide range of reactions under mild conditions. Their use in synthesis is however limited in part by chemists' apprehension to handle enzymes. We propose to develop simple biocatalytic methods to generate novel aminoglycosides and hydroxylate inactivated C-H bonds. Aminoglycosides are clinically important broad spectrum antibiotics. Unfortunately, the emergence of resistance is increasingly restricting their use. A better understanding of resistance-causing mechanisms is critical to conquer this health threat. The synthesis of aminoglycoside derivatives is challenging because of solubility issues and of the complex protection schemes required. We have developed a novel methodology for selective N-6' acylation of aminoglycosides. This has allowed the one-pot synthesis of the first nanomolar inhibitors of resistance-causing aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase Ii. Our next goal is to prepare aminoglycosides able to escape resistance-causing enzymes while maintaining their antibacterial activity. To this end, we propose to develop new chemoenzymatic methodologies for the regioselective derivatization of aminoglycosides. Commercial enzymes and acetyltransferases will be used. In parallel, we propose to study P450 enzymes for their impressive ability to catalyze the insertion of oxygen into non-activated C-H bonds. Very few methods exist that directly hydroxylate aliphatic C-H bonds, and most of them are of limited scope. P450s represent a promising alternative; however, a number of limitations have restricted their use. These include substrate specificity, the need for 2 or 3 cofactors, incompatibility with organic solvents, low activity and poor stability. The very promiscuous P450s 3A4 and 2D6 were selected to overcome the substrate specificity issue. We have reported that some cheap chemicals can efficiently replace the natural cofactors. and recently found conditions to use these enzymes in the presence of organic solvents. Next we propose to develop a system of substrate tagging to allow prediction of the regio- and stereo-selectivity of P450s.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"Viruses are extraordinary biological entities containing genetic information that provide cells with instructions for virus replication. These instructions are generally given priority over other cellular functions, giving the virus control of the cell. Virus replication, however, does not occur naturally outside of a cell; therefore, viruses have evolved to efficiently enter cells and deliver their genetic material. These characteristics make a virus a formidable foe when trying to combat viral diseases. Viruses, however, can also be used as an ally. They can be used to ""prime"" the immune system and act as a vaccine, or through genetic manipulation, can be ""engineered"" to direct cells to produce a desired product. Baculovirus, a virus that only replicates in insects, can be genetically engineered to direct insect cells in culture to produce virus-like particles (viruses devoid of genetic information) that are highly sought as vaccines. Challenge. Current world-wide cell culture capacity is not sufficient to meet the needs of a sudden viral outbreak, making the response to such an outbreak impossible. There is therefore a need to develop strategies for process intensification using a flexible production platform. The baculovirus expression platform allows both the flexibility and scale-up potential needed; however, at high densities, the use of large amounts of virus and drops in specific production limit the full potential of this system. To address these concerns, novel strategies and tools are needed. Novel infection strategies require an in-depth understanding of the system to be able to relate viral genome replication and transcription to protein expression. The driving hypothesis is that protein expression is limited at high densities by both viral genome replication and transcription. Novel tools are also needed to provide a better description of the cell's state before and after infection. High throughput phenotype microarray technology and other ""fingerprinting"" techniques will be used to characterize the cells and media to optimize the productions at high cell densities. This research will help position Canada as a leader in the manufacturing of vaccines based on virus-like particles and will train highly qualified personnel able to strengthen Canada's bio-pharmaceutical industry.

"Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying cellular function is a major goal in science. Unfortunately natural cell populations obtained from the blood or from various tissues are often difficult to study, as they can only be obtained in heterogeneous mixtures. For instance, stem cells found in adult tissues have a great potential in medicine for replacing damaged or diseased tissues. However, they are rare and cannot be harvested or grown to the large numbers needed for conventional bulk biochemical assays. Thus, single cell assays are essential for studying and understanding cell behaviour and the development of stem cell-based technologies and therapies. Capillary electrophoresis (CE), performed in  fused-silica columns or on microchip channels, is a separation technology that is capable of high resolution separations of analytes based on size and charge from small volumes (< 10^-9 L). As such CE combined with the enhanced detection sensitivity of a laser-induced fluorescence detection scheme represents a powerful approach for the analysis of single mammalian cells.  The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and optimize strategies for the biochemical analysis of single-cell by capillary and microchip electrophoresis. The first specific objective is to maximize the recovery of analytes from specific cell compartments by optimizing the method of cell sampling and the fabrication of the separation column. The second objective is to demonstrate the utility of single-cell CE to analyse posttranslational modifications of a membrane-tethered transcription factor important in stem cell fate decision, Notch. Single-cell electrophoresis in capillaries or on microchips is emerging as the next revolution in tools for biological discovery. Improved sampling and the ability to estimate losses will allow more sensitive and precise quantitation of fluorescent analytes in cells. Furthermore, once optimized, single-cell CE will provide a powerful means to study proteins that have complex posttranslational regulation such as the Notch protein. Consequently, single-cell CE has the potential to become an essential tool in development of drug, gene or cellular therapies targeting Notch and stem cells in general.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"CMOS integrated circuits (ICs) are now prevailing in numerous electronic applications like computing, processing of images, video, music, and voice, wireless communication and sensors. The demand for low cost ICs with more functionality and greater processing speed forces designers to exploit state of the art CMOS technologies to their limits. Years ago, the microelectronic community identified metal wire used for interconnects in ICs as a key limiting factor for further speed  improvement of signal propagation in submicron CMOS processes. The resistivity and the capacitance associated with these wires, especially long buses used in digital circuits, degrades the high frequency switching signal transmitted on the bus.

In order to compensate for this limitation, researchers have proposed replacing metal wires with optical interconnects in which the signal is transmitted by photons instead of electrons. Photons do not have a charge and thus interact less with matter, allowing them to travel at high speed with minimum perturbation from external noise sources. Waveguides currently used in micro-optics can not be fabricated from standard CMOS processes, which presents a major barrier to the integration of optical interconnects in CMOS integrated systems. Recent work on the propagation of Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) on metal lines has provided another alternative for optical interconnects on CMOS integrated circuits. SPPs are electromagnetic waves propagated at the interface of a thin metal line and a dielectric. This research proposal aims to study SPPs propagation on metal lines and dielectric materials used in state of the art submicron CMOS processes. In the long term, integration of SPPs as signal carriers into CMOS technology is expected to fulfill the performance requirement of future integrated systems with minimal or no change required in the next generation of CMOS fabrication processes.

"Nanotechnology has progressed significantly over the past decade, based largely on the unique properties of carbon nanotubes. The development of biologically relevant nanomachines and their building blocks has, in general, focused on the addition of biological functionality to carbon nanotube scaffolds. However, despite the unique chemical properties of carbon nanotubes, their use in biological systems remains limited due to issues with direct and/or indirect toxicity. My research program focuses on identifying and engineering protein-based systems as an alternative approach to the development of biologically accepted nanostructures. This method has several advantages over the carbon nanotube adaptation, including access to modern protein engineering tools and the ready biological acceptance of a structure that is itself biotic in origin.  I recently discovered the assembly of a protein nanotube from an engineered form of the type IV pilin protein from the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which represents the first instance of the controlled generation of a nanotube from a soluble monomeric protein under physiological conditions. The current proposal aims at characterizing the assembly and structure of these novel protein nanotubes, adding specific functionalities to the protein nanotubes through protein engineering, and examining the oligomerization of protein nanotubes on conducting and semi-conducting surfaces. These studies will greatly increase our understanding into the assembly of these unique nanostructures and provide a significant step forward in the development of protein nanotubes for bionanotechnology applications.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"I will examine the interaction between stress and reward from with respect to behaviour and neural circuitry. Rewarding stimuli including food and drugs of abuse activate the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. Cessation of drug intake is associated with the emergence of a negative emotional state in human drug addicts. Furthermore, negative affect or stress is associated with drug-seeking behaviour in human addicts, a phenomena that has been successfully reproduced in animal models of drug seeking, particularly in the reinstatement model of drug seeking. I plan to apply recently developed animal models of cocaine and alcohol dependence to the identification of both pharmacological and environmental factors that predict persistent alterations in reward- and stres-related behavioural performance. Additionally, I will also seek to elucidate the neural mechanisms that accompany these behavioural alterations. These studies will involve both systemic and central administration of ligands into brain regions that have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of both stress and reward and will target novel neurotransmitter systems that are localized primarily in stress- and reward-related brain regions. These studies will focus on identification of the pharmacological mechanisms related to changes in stress and reward-related performance. The results will contribute to the reward and stress literatures and may also have important implications for drug addiction.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Manitoba,Manitoba
"    )	Feeding breadth in aggressive tree-killing bark beetles has implications to outbreak initiation and duration.  An outbreak of mountain pine beetle in western Canada currently covers an area approaching 10 million ha.  While the primary host of mountain pine beetle is lodgepole pine, its recent progression into Alberta has raised the prospect of expansion into jack pine of the boreal forest that stretches to the Maritimes.  In the interior of British Columbia, a shrinking supply of mature lodgepole pine has led to increased attacks on young lodgepole pine and mature spruce.  While phloem in young pine is generally too thin for viable brood development, little is known about potential development in mature spruce.  Preliminary studies in spruce indicate that brood development may be as successful as in mature lodgepole pine.  Such development, in concert with potential host fidelity (i.e., the propensity of progeny to reattack similar host species) could lead to host race formation, and, pending barriers to gene flow such as developmental asynchrony in different hosts, specialization.  The proposed research seeks to study potential costs and benefits to reproduction in a ""novel"" host in an aggressive, tree-killing bark beetle as a possible step in host-race formation and feeding specialization.",Environnement,Environnement,"Evolution & Ecology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"Nutrition is an important determinant of kidney physiology.  This proposal seeks to explore how nutrients affect important regulatory compounds called eicosanoids in the kidney.  Eicosanoids are biologically active compounds that are made from fatty acids in tissues.  These compounds are important in maintaining normal kidney function, especially when the kidneys are damaged.  The type and amount of eicosanoids that are made in the kidney is influenced by the types of fatty acids present in the kidney and the activity of the proteins (enzymes) which mediate the formation of these compounds.



In the past several years, we have shown that diet can not only affect progression of kidney disease, but also alter a small class of these eicosanoids.  We recently have established within our laboratory the ability to analyze these eicosanoids by mass spectrometry.  This technique allows the sensitive identification, separation and quantification of eicosanoids derived from different fatty acids.



Therefore we propose to further understand how dietary manipulations influence a wider range of these eicosanoids in the kidney, as well as the expression of genes for the proteins that make these eicosanoids, the levels of these proteins and their activity.  The dietary interventions include using soybean protein isolates and fish oil.  We propose to do this in the rat model so that the effects in the kidney can be examined in the context of the whole animal.  Specific inhibitors of key proteins in the formation of the eicosanoids will be used in combination with the diets to probe in more detail how diet affects the formation of eicosanoids.  To examine these effects in even more detail, we also propose to examine effects of specific fats in kidney cells grown on a dish.  These studies will help us understand how diet influences kidney physiology.

"Understanding development is a critical step in understanding how an organism functions. One of the key aspects of understanding animal development requires the ability to watch during development how proteins interact with each other and how they generate signals within and between cells that help coordinate development.  A powerful tool to do this is to use fluorescent tags attached to proteins with a live cell or tissue to study development.  These tags come in a wide range of colour from blue, green, orange, yellow, red and even far-red.  This means that researchers can study many proteins at the same time in a living cell to obtain a clear picture on how these proteins interact and what signals they generate.  For instance, during the development of the nervous system, how cells migrate or extend processes to their final positions in the nervous system can be investigated. By following how cells move and signal in real time (i.e. live) provides far more information about how development is controlled than traditional approaches that fixed the cell in place. For these approaches, imaging these proteins within developing cells or tissues is required. A specialized microscope that uses high magnification but can detect faint signals without killing the cells is essential. The Deltavision microscope is an excellent example of a system that allows live cells to be imaged for hours without any damage and allows many labels to be followed in the same cell. However this system needs a separate, fast, powerful computer to manipulate the images rapidly to allow for high resolution digital images to be processed efficiently.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Genes, Cells and Molecules",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Spermatogenesis is a cell differentiation process leading to the formation of the male gametes (spermatozoa). The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of sperm cells is associated with a set of highly basic proteins called protamines. This contrasts with the rest of the body, including eggs, in which the DNA is associated with a broad spectrum of nuclear proteins such as core histones, linker histones and non-histone proteins. In both instances, the resulting protein-DNA complexes are called chromatin.

    During spermatogenesis, histones of chromatin from the stem cells are replaced in the mature sperm by sperm-specific histones (H), protamines (P), or protamine-like proteins (PL), which have an intermediate chemical composition between H and P. This histone replacement process reverts during fertilization of the egg by the sperm.

    The molecular mechanisms involved in these chromatin rearrangements are poorly understood. The long-term objective of this research is to describe and understand the structural changes and factors involved in the chromatin modifications during spermatogenesis and after fertilization. To facilitate this, we have selected several invertebrate and vertebrate organisms, with high levels of gametes, for analysis.

    This research has a two-fold interest. From an applied perspective, the understanding of these chromatin transitions could enlighten society on human infertility problems, sperm competition, and speciation in other organisms. From an academic perspective, the analysis and characterization of the genes and corresponding proteins involved in these processes, in different organisms, provide a unique opportunity to study their evolution.

"I study the details of the internal structure of nuclei.  Nuclei are the very small cores which are all that is left over when all of the electrons are removed from an atom.  Excited nuclei can emit very high energy radiation, called gamma rays.  I observe gamma rays using a spectrometer called TIGRESS which lives at TRIUMF in Vancouver, BC.  



The gamma rays I observe can tell me about what it is that keeps the nucleus bound together.  I can learn more by observing gamma rays from nuclei that are not well bound together, or bound in an unusual way.  To find those nuclei, I use the unstable beams provided by the ISAC accelerator at TRIUMF.  



Gamma rays can also teach me about exploding stars.  The fuel in stars is nuclei and the way the nuclei burn is determined by their structure.  The more we can learn about the structure of nuclei that are involved in stellar explosions, the more we can learn about how stellar explosions create elements.

"The history of life has been marked by transitions involving the association of lower level units into higher levels of organization. Research in my laboratory focuses on the association of individuals into social groups, seeking to address its causes and consequences.  Using a combination of comparative, experimental, and theoretical approaches, and social spiders as a model system, specific topics of research include:



The ecology of social evolution.- In order to understand why organisms live in groups and cooperate we need to understand the environmental conditions that select for social living.  Social spiders are ideal to address this question given the number of times they have evolved sociality, their diverse social systems, and the fact that closely related species in different environments may differ in whether they are social or not.  We will investigate the environmental conditions associated with spider sociality and experimentally manipulate factors that we hypothesize to be directly responsible for their social systems.  



Sociality and species coexistence.- By virtue of group living and cooperation, social species are likely to enter new adaptive zones in which they are able to utilize resources not accessible to solitary or less social species (e.g., capture prey many times the body size of individual foragers). This effect may lead to differences in how closely related social and nonsocial species use resources, which may in turn facilitate their coexistence.  By studying the make up of multispecies communities and the patterns of resource use by species with different social systems, we will explore the role that sociality may play in biodiversity. 



Addressing these questions will allow us to better appreciate how nature works, why we and other animals are social, and how sociality may be important for biodiversity.

"I am proposing to work on polyhedral computation, and in particular, its applications in quantum information and discrete optimization.

Quantum Information.

In collaboration with researchers at ERATO and the University of Tokyo, we have made extensive advances in recent years in understanding Bell inequalities and, to a much lesser extent, quantum correlations. Our future goals are to provide efficient procedures (where possible) to compute maximum violations of Bell inequalities and to provide feasible quantum setups that give such violations. These setups are natural candidates for exploiting optimally the additional power given by quantum information processing. 

Discrete Optimization.

We are currently studying discrete optimization problems related to mining optimization, in particular the solution to the so-called ""optimum pit"" problem with additional knapsack like constraints. We are adopting a polyhedral approach, which eventually should yield strong cutting planes that can be used in a branch and cut solution (these problems are NP-hard). We will also study LP and semidefinite approximations. The related polyhedra are directed analogues of the well studied cut and semimetric polytopes.

Polyhedral Computation.

I will continue the development of the lrs library. This freely distributed and widely used code employs the reverse search technique and exact arithmetic to compute the vertices or facets of high dimensional polyhedra and related problems in polyhedral computation. New theoretical advances will be needed to improve the performance of the code on highly symmetric and highly degenerate combinatorial polytopes. Recent additions to the package includes a program to compute Nash Equilibria by means of two nested reverse searches on related polyhedra.

"The export to foreign markets of Canadian wood products or products with wood packaging will be restricted if Canadian and foreign regulatory agencies believe there is a phytosanitary risk, i.e. a risk that beetles/fungal associates and other pests are present in the wood. Exports of wood products from infested regions can be maintained by treatments like convective heating and fumigation with methyl bromide. Methyl bromide is being phased out under the Montreal Protocol as an ozone-depleting chemical. Heat treatment is not always economically feasible, especially for larger size material; for green wood products, which are exported with high moisture contents, it is impractical. Alternative treatments include other fumigants, chemical pressure impregnation, dielectric heating with microwave or radio frequency technology, and gamma irradiation. Before alternative methods can be used industrially for green wood products, they need to be further developed and optimized, and then approved by international phytosanitary control groups. We propose to evaluate radio frequency technology as an alternative treatment method for green wood products. Although this technology has already been recognized as a drying process for lumber, it has not been tested for eliminating pests in green dimensional wood. It may be an efficient way of introducing high temperatures for short times (e.g. 70oC for 2 minutes) that will result in keeping more moisture into the wood. If successful, the technology could be implemented rapidly at an industrial scale, could change how pest control is handled in international trade for large green dimensional timber and logs, and would give Canadian industry the opportunity to be a leader in this technology while maintaining and increasing export sales of green wood products.

"At its core, chemistry is the study of how substances are transformed by chemical reactions. Theoretical approaches to chemistry use mathematical and computational techniques to describe chemical reactions and molecular properties and are particularly important when experimental studies are impractical or experimental data are difficult to interpret. Within the purview of theoretical chemistry, no task is more fundamental than the reaction prediction problem: does a given choice of reagents react in a particular environment and, if so, what is the product? Furthermore, it is important to know the chemical reaction mechanism: the sequence of molecular changes between reactants and products that defines how the chemical reaction occurs. Knowledge of the reaction mechanism allows one to predict reaction rates and facilitates the design of new chemical processes that minimize wasteful side-reactions or maximize the reaction rate.

The second part of my research is developing quantitative tools for predicting which of the possible reaction mechanisms actually occurs. Typically, the most favorable reaction mechanism is the one that takes the least energy; this defines the minimum-energy reaction path. Thus, in order to predict reaction products and mechanisms, we need to compute the relative energy of different molecular conformations. The third part of my research is developing accurate and efficient methods for the electronic structure problem; these methods are used to compute the relative energy of different molecular structures.

"Photolysis of snow-bound nitrates has been identified as the source for intense photochemical NOx fluxes that have been observed to emanate for the sunlit snow pack in Antarctica, Greenland, the Canadian arctic and many other permanently or seasonally snow covered regions.  Numerical models have failed to provide an adequate interpretation for this phenomenon which controls the oxidative potential of the polar boundary layer.  This highlights our poor understanding of the mechanisms at the molecular level and the lack of appropriate physical parameters to describe the heterogeneous photolysis rates of nitrates in ice.  Furthermore, there are several indications that there might be a considerable bias favouring photoproducts from nitrates adsorbed or segregated to the surface of snow grains.  We propose to investigate the factors that control the photolysis rate at ice surfaces and quantify their surface specificity.  Using thin ice film surrogates, we will investigate the most important physical parameters in an attempt to provide a molecular-level mechanistic description of this phenomenon.  This will enable a quantitative evaluation of the photochemical fluxes and improve the interpretation of climate proxies from ice cores.  These quantitative laboratory-based investigations are important and timely at the dawn of the International Polar Year 2007-2008.

"New techniques have allowed in the past years to manufacture very small particles (~1 millionth of a millimetre) that are known as nano-particles. These particles have lead to new applications in various fields such as the environmental, oil, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Due to their very small size, such particles can be injected in media that have very small pores and used for important applications such as the enhanced recovery of oil in reservoirs or the remediation of contaminated soils. With these new applications came important issues related to how to follow and control the transport of such particles in the media. Today, there is a real need to optimize the use of such particles but also to prevent any possible uncontrollable migration of the nano-particles that may pose health problems.



This proposal aims at looking at the flow of a suspension of nano-particles in a liquid as it moves through micro-geometries. The main objective is to understand how the suspension interacts with a residing fluid such as groundwater or trapped oil. Due to the complexity and opacity of such systems, we propose to use mainly numerical modelling to analyze the flow. In particular, we will adopt a relatively new technique that allows to follow the particles and the fluids as they move through the geometry and to determine how the particles are transported and the effects on the stability of the displacement front. We will look at situations where the particles are either inert or carry chemical agents and interact with the surrounding fluids. Such complex interactions involve various mechanisms of fluid flow instabilities as well as chemical and thermal effects. It is anticipated that the results of this study will provide new conditions for an optimum and more efficient use and control of the flow of nano-particle suspensions.

"Economic prosperity is influenced by the exploration of new sources of energy and materials along with the development of existing reserves. The Canadian mining industry contributes $40 billion to the economy and accounts for about 4% of the Gross Domestic Product. This important activity is associated with large volumes of ever increasing mine wastes of variable nature and extent. The mine tailings (slurries generated during ore processing) are particularly challenging because of their slow settling rates and high standing toxic waters in the waste containment facilities. Several tailings dam failures around the world resulted in massive contamination causing acute public distress over the conventional practice of tailings disposal. The industry has been proactive in developing novel waste management methods to minimize its environmental footprint. The proposed research will devise sustainable (cost effective, environmentally friendly, and socially viable) engineering solutions for base-metal mining operations by investigating the innovative method of slurry thickening. The specific goals include the following: (a) design of nonsegregating thickener feed to maximize the effectiveness of flocculation; (b) improve tailings dewatering during thickening to increase the efficiency of gravity thickeners; and (c) predict the long-term behavior of thickener underflow to evaluate subaqueous disposal in tailings ponds. This research will help produce nonsegregating tailings streams with bulk of the process water removed and recycled back for ore beneficiation. The low water content engineered materials will occupy a much smaller disposal area that can be reclaimed as a useful landscape in a relatively short time. In addition to an increased storage capacity of the tailings impoundments, the new tailings management solutions will help decrease environmental liabilities due to reduced acid rock drainage and metal leaching.","D�chets, gestion des d�chets et recyclage","Services commerciaux","Civil Engineering - B",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan
"Given the unquestionable scientific and technological interest in strengthening research and training in the increasingly important area of Ultrafast Photonics in Canada, the three co-applicants have recently established at INRS-EMT a vigorous research program focused on a fundamental technology development, namely the proposal and demonstration of simple and practical fiber-optics techniques for ultrafast optical pulse shaping capable of providing the stringent performance specifications that are required for many relevant applications in a variety of fields, including (1) ultrahigh-speed fiber-optics telecommunications; (2) biomedical imaging; (3) ultrafast all-optical computing; and (4) ultra-wideband (UWB) microwave signal generation and processing. The two main distinctive features of the target fiber-optics pulse shaping techniques are: (i) they will enable synthesizing arbitrary pulse waveforms with time features down to the sub-picosecond range, a regime that is well beyond the reach of present all-fiber pulse shaping technologies; and (ii) they will provide full shape-to-shape reconfigurability at unprecedented switching speeds, in the GHz range (several orders of magnitude faster than with present solutions). The newly proposed fiber-optics pulse shaping toolset will be constructed using two alternative approaches based on the use of optical fiber dispersion combined with electro-optic modulation: (A) Temporal imaging; and (B) Time-domain linear optical filtering.

The present grant application will complement funding from other sources with the aim of acquiring state-of-the-art instrumentation that is absolutely critical for the successful implementation of the proposed reconfigurable fiber-optics ultrafast pulse-shaping methods, namely a GHz-bandwidth programmable electronic arbitrary waveform generator. Direct benefits associated with our proposed research projects include (i) they will foster focused research activities in innovative fundamental photonics technologies , consistently with the specific needs of the high-technology Canadian industry, and (iii) they will promote the training of highly qualified personnel in response to the scientific and technological challenges of our modern society.

"The ultimate goal of this project is to commercialize a highly-performing and cost-effective laser range finder (LRF) system based on a novel coherent interferometry concept , namely 'Cross-chirped interferometry (XCI)', which has been recently invented by the involved research team. 



The proposed LRF technology is of particular interest for high-resolution, dynamic (real-time) 2D/3D imaging and ranging applications and it would allow overcoming the key limitations and performance trade-offs of the presently used technological approaches, i.e. time-of-flight method or conventional interferometry techniques. Our preliminary proof-of-concept experiments have proved the potential of the XCI concept to achieve an unprecedented combination of performance specifications, significantly outperforming any of the presently commercialized LRF solutions, using a relatively simpler and lower cost fiber-optics implementation. Our next objective is to develop an optimized experimental prototype with the aim of providing a demonstration and full evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of the XCI technology for real-time, high-resolution short to mid-range imaging, positioning and ranging applications.  



The development of the proposed LRF technology will have a very positive impact in the Canadian economy both by providing a solution with a very strong commercial potential and by directly improving the competitiveness of our industry across many different industrial, scientific and biomedical fields and sectors.

"One of the most promising recent developments in the wireless world is the move towards ultrawide-band (UWB) pulse-based communication, spurred on by recent steps being taken to enable the unlicensed use of the required frequency band around the world. The proposed three year project oversees the development of several novel passive microwave structures tailored to the needs of emerging UWB systems. This theoretical and experimental research will allow the two university teams from INRS-EMT and McGill Univ., in collaboration with their industrial partner Apollo Microwaves, to lead Canadian and worldwide efforts in developing cost-effective, high-performance solutions for the emerging UWB market. Specifically, our research is directed toward solving the problem of generating UWB pulses WITH ARBITRARILY DEFINED SHAPES, which is of fundamental importance for the future development of UWB-based applications. Our approach is based on a new class of microwave filters featuring electromagnetic bandgaps (EBGs), which are simple to implement in a wide variety of well-established microwave technologies and offer unprecedented design flexibility. Research effort will be directed as follows: (i) Accurate and general synthesis tools will be developed for the design of customized UWB-oriented passive structures; (ii) Simple and practical static UWB arbitrary pulse-shaping filters based on EBGs in coaxial-line and ridge waveguide technologies will be designed, fabricated and characterized; (iii) Fully-reconfigurable UWB arbitrary pulse generators will be designed, implemented and tested. This will have a dramatic impact in such diverse UWB-candidate applications as wireless telecom, military radar, sensing networks and biomedical imaging. The flexibility of our approach and the maturity of the microwave technologies in which our concepts can be implemented will yield cost-efficient, mass-producible structures amenable to commercialization. Finally, the new knowledge generated from this project and the training of highly qualified personnel associated to the different stages of this work will certainly contribute to enhance Canada's global competitiveness in high-technology sectors.","Syst�mes d'information et technologie de l'information","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"Advantages of processing the information in the all-optical domain include the tremendous available bandwidth and the parallelism intrinsic to the optical approach, which translate into ultrahigh processing speeds well above the reach of present, more conventional electronic-based solutions. The research program described here will focus on the development of a set of all-optical time-domain signal processing devices, either currently unavailable or presently based on impractical solutions, which are of critical importance in various applied fields, including ultrahigh-bit-rate optical telecommunications, ultrafast pulse shaping and metrology, and all-optical information processing. The targeted devices will be implemented using all-fiber technologies, particularly ""fiber gratings"", which are attractive due to their simplicity and compactness, low insertion losses, potential for low cost, and compatibility with fiber-optics systems. My research will be directed towards two fundamental developments: (a) All-fiber sub-picosecond optical pulse shaping devices, our main target being the realization of devices enabling the synthesis of arbitrary pulse shapes with temporal resolutions down to the sub-picosecond range, a regime that cannot be generally reached with present fiber technologies; and (b) Basic ultrafast all-fiber signal processors, targeting the design, experimental realization and application of various fundamental building blocks for future all-optical processing circuits, including photonic temporal differentiators and integrators. The fiber-optics concepts to be investigated could be easily migrated into integrated waveguide implementations, which would open a range of new, exciting application perspectives for the targeted technologies. Besides the mentioned short-term applications, the proposed research will allow the acquisition of a fundamental know-how for a multitude of other technological and scientific applications in such diverse fields as ultrafast all-optical computing, biomedical imaging and quantum optics. The new knowledge generated from this program and the training of highly qualified personnel in the targeted strategic areas will contribute to enhance Canada's global competitiveness in high-technology sectors.

"Recent years have witnessed an enormous interest in the emerging technology of organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) for flat panel display applications.  Compared to alternative technologies (e.g. liquid crystal displays or plasma displays),  OLEDs promise higher efficiency (hence lower power consumption), more vivid emission colors (hence better image quality),  and a unique potential for realizing mechanically flexible displays for  ""foldable"", ""roll-able"", ""wearable"" and ""unbreakable"" or ruggedized electronics (hence new products and market opportunities).   However, the relatively poor device stability, especially that of blue-emitting OLEDs (which, alongside red and green-emitting OLEDs, are necessary for full color displays) limits wider technology commercialization. Developing more stable blue OLEDs is essential for expanding their range of applications, especially in high value-added products (e.g. laptop displays).   However, the realization of more stable blue OLEDs has been hampered by the lack of a clear understanding of the underlying degradation factors. The proposed research aims at identifying and understanding the factors behind the EL degradation in blue OLEDs.  The investigation will proceed along three distinct yet complementary thrusts that will provide useful information on different aspects of device EL degradation processes.  The thrusts utilize a number of experimental techniques pioneered by the applicant from his previous studies on green OLEDs.  The research results will be critical for future development of more stable blue OLEDs, which will be pursued in collaboration with Canadian industrial partners (e.g. Canadian displays companies and others in related sectors). It will, therefore, provide those partners with a competitive edge in an area of high relevance to their core business (flat panel displays industry).  The research will also allow training of a new ""breed"" of Canadian researchers who will acquire expertise in an emerging technology that has the potential to enable new products and market opportunities.","Machinerie et �quipement �lectriques et �lectroniques (y compris mat�riel informatique)","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Condensed Matter Physics",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"As ""easy oil"" reserves are depleted, recovery of heavy/ultra-heavy oil becomes more crucial for world's future energy demand.  Oil recovery from heavy oil reservoirs by its natural energy is a very slow process, if not impossible like in the cases of oil sands/bitumen, and the residual oil left behind is generally beyond the economic limits.  Therefore, additional support of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques such as steam, gas (typically miscible), or chemical injections are must in many circumstances.  Although increasing oil prices enable us to inject such expensive materials into oil reservoirs, the efficiency of the injection processes has always been a critical issue.  This project proposes investigations on the ways to increase the efficiency of EOR techniques applied to heavy-oil reservoirs.  



Several different approaches, as listed below, will be tested and analyzed in terms of increasing the efficiency of in-situ heavy-oil/bitumen recovery:



(1) ""Hybrid application"" of steam and solvent (hydrocarbon and CO2) injection 



(2) Oil displacement characteristics during ultrasonic aided thermal techniques, and



(3) Pure or steam aided CO2 injection in oil/heavy-oil recovery from sandstone and fracured carbonate reservoirs.

"The proposed research program aims to study the problem of data exchange from a B2B e-commerce perspective. In order for two enterprises to conduct business electronically, they must exchange data. For these exchanges to occur, both enterprise information systems must be compatible. This can only occur if there is a shared, common understanding. Should no such understanding be available, some mediation must be done for the exchange to be successful.



Building on previous results, this research program will study the problem of adaptable mediators, i.e., software that will act as an interface between information systems. In particular, we are interested in the automatic adaptability of these mediators, without human intervention. We seek to answer questions pertaining to change detection in information systems and knowledge management.



The results should enable the development of mediators to support the deployment of the Service Oriented Architecture, minimizing the adaptation costs between systems to integrate. They will also help identify what knowledge is required, nice to have or useful for adaptability to occur, hence providing some requirements to enterprise knowledge management.","Syst�mes d'information et technologie de l'information","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computing and Information Sciences - A",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Groups and clusters of galaxies are truly remarkable structures.  With masses equivalent to anywhere from 10,000 billion suns to a mind-boggling million billion suns, these systems are the largest, most massive gravitationally bound objects in the Universe.  Moreover, having formed relatively recently, these systems still bear the imprints of the processes that led to their formation.  Studying these cosmic colossi, therefore, offers a unique window into the very processes that have shaped cosmic structure formation.



Recent observational studies of galaxy groups and clusters are revealing a perplexing range of properties and characteristics that cannot be easily accounted for within the currently accepted theoretical models.  This growing chasm between theory and observations has exposed critical gaps in our understanding of the intricate web of gravitational, radiative and gas-dynamical processes at play in these systems. At present, a detailed understanding of each of these processes and how they couple together - reinforcing, amplifying or even suppressing each other through feedback loops - remains sketchy at best.  



Building upon my recent, highly successful efforts,  I propose a concerted theoretical study aimed at developing a realistic, self-consistent, physically-motivated framework for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxy groups and clusters, and for interpreting the observed characteristics.  The principal challenge involved lies in identifying all the physical processes at play, ascertaining the inter-relationships between them, and assessing their importance.   In pursuit of this goal, the proposed program will take advantage of a variety of approaches, ranging from explorations involving simple but physically intuitive analytic models to the use of highly sophisticated numerical simulations designed to capture the full richness of the interplay between the processes.

"Nearly every eukaryotic mRNA possesses a 3' adenosine (A) tail. This stretch of poly(A) plays key roles in the physiology of an mRNA, including nuclear export, stability, and translation. As yet, however, the molecular mechanism by which poly(A) tail length is determined during de novo synthesis remains elusive. This is an important problem, because without such knowledge a detailed understanding of how poly(A) tail length controls mRNA metabolism, and accordingly gene regulation, is highly unlikely. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the mechanism by which poly(A) tail length control is determined and regulated. It is our hypothesis that the nuclear poly(A) binding protein plays a critical role in the determination of poly(A) tail length. We have recently cloned and characterized a functional homolog of the mammalian nuclear poly(A)-binding protein in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Because there is a significant degree of conservation from yeast to mammals among the components required for polyadenylation, these studies in yeast allow us to rapidly obtain experimental insights applicable to all eukaryotes. Elucidation of the mechanism by which the nuclear poly(A) binding protein regulates mRNA polyadenylation and a better understanding of poly(A) tail length control are anticipated from our research program.

"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are playing an increasingly important role in ocean observations and sea floor mapping. In particular, autonomous underwater gliders have seen a dramatic increase in usage. 

Gliders move through the water column in a saw-tooth pattern. By changing their weight in water from positively to negatively buoyant they can reverse their direction of motion from upward to downward. A set of fixed wings generates, similar to a soaring plane, lift and drag that propel the vehicle not only in the vertical but also in the horizontal direction, generating the characteristic saw-tooth motion pattern. 

In this research I am proposing to develop algorithms and sensing solutions for gliders, that help them (a) to navigate more accurately while they are submerged and (b) will be able to estimate the water currents they are flying in. 

These objectives will be achieved by a developing a highly accurate mathematical model of the gliders' dynamics. One of the inputs into this model will be the external flow conditions. The output of the model will consist of position and attitude as well as the associated velocities. Since the physical gliders are instrumented with depth and attitude sensors these measurements potentially can be used to extract the unknown flow conditions using an inverse model.

The extracted flow information is of great importance to physical oceanographers in itself but it also can be used to improve the navigation accuracy of the glider while submerged.  

The long-term objectives of this research program are to achieve long duration missions, potentially under the ice, without the need for frequent surfacings for position updates. Together with a to-be developed acoustic long-range underwater navigation system, the above described short-term goals will help to achieve this objective and will give access to areas that are permanently or seasonally ice-covered. This enabling technology will give scientists access to these regions and provide them with data previously unavailable.

"Ovarian cancer (OC) accounts for 4% of all cancers in women and is the leading cause of death from gynaecologic malignancies. The molecular basis of OC initiation and progression is still poorly understood. To establish novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies against this deadly disease, it is essential to understand its molecular pathology.   One of the key pathogenic elements underlying human cancer is disruption of normal gene regulation. Recently, the importance of epigenetic perturbation of gene regulation in cancer linked with aberrant DNA methylation has begun to be more fully appreciated. Our project aims to identify novel genes with aberrant DNA methylation that might be implicated in OC etiology. The proposed research represents a systematic approach for the identification of novel OC epigenetic targets, starting with genome-wide discovery, quantitative and robust methylation analysis and proceeding with epigenetic marker validation across many OC samples. We also propose to develop and implement post-processing software needed for the quantitative methylation analyses, as well as novel primer-design software, which could considerably improve the targeted amplification of specific bisulfite-treated DNA promoter sites.  A cost-effective, high-throughput DNA methylation analysis tool would help tremendously to understand the relationship between the status of the tens of thousands of potential methylation sites and disease and might provide novel biomarkers for improved diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of OC. The innovative technologies and methodological approaches proposed could be ultimately applied for epigenetic target discovery and validation in other cancer types.","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel",2,"CHRPJ ","Collaborative Health Research Projects","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"Our work is in the area of synthetic organic chemistry, generally directed toward the synthesis of biologically interesting molecules, and frequently based on novel aspects of organosulfur and selenium chemistry. Our program includes:

1) New cyclization protocols based on unsaturated sulfones are being developed that provide efficient new routes to a variety of alkaloids and related heterocycles, including several dendrobatid alkaloids that have cardiotonic and neurochemical activities, the anticancer agents motuporamine A and B, and others that are in progress. 2) We are investigating a new variation of the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction, which is a valuable method for constructing strategic carbon-carbon bonds. We have coupled this process with other reactions that provide convenient access to substituted piperidines and pyridines, common structures among medicinal compounds. 3) Glutathione peroxidase is a selenoenzyme that protects higher organisms from oxidative stress by catalytically destroying harmful peroxides that cause inflammation, cardiovascular damage and other deleterious effects. We are developing novel small-molecule selenium compounds with unusual structural motifs that mimic the activity of the enzyme, and we are investigating the mechanisms by which they function. Several  compounds that we have discovered are more effective catalysts than ebselen, a compound being tested in Phase III clinical trials for treating cardiovascular disease by the Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. in Japan. 4) We recently completed the enantioselective synthesis of virantmycin, a rare natural product with powerful antiviral activity. Methodology that was developed for this purpose is being investigated for new applications, mainly as an approach to novel unnatural amino acids that are potentially useful in peptidomimetic drugs and as building blocks for the synthesis of other types of alkaloids.

"In recent years, non-invasive laser-based diagnostic and imaging techniques have been proposed and developed. Photoacoustic signal generation is a technique which has demonstrated great potential for visualization of the internal structures and function of soft tissue. With this technique, a short-pulsed laser

source is used to irradiate the sample. The energy absorbed produces a small temperature rise which induces a pressure inside the sample through thermal expansion. This pressure acts as an acoustic source and generates

further acoustic waves which can be detected by ultrasound transducers positioned outside the sample.  



Photoacoustic tomography has so far been based on pulsed laser excitation. This leads to a simpler theory but also has inherent limitations due to restrictions on laser power and sampling rates. To overcome this, a Fourier-Domain photothermoacoustic imaging methodology has been proposed.  However, the longer pulse implies that new analytical tools are needed -- which is what this project aims to address.



The goal of research into bio-acoustophotonics of tissues is the development of methodologies which hold the promise for sensitive diagnostics of cancerous lesions in, e.g., a human breast. The benefits of any advances in soft tissue imaging are obvious. The objective is to design instruments that are accurate, non-invasive and yet remain cost-effective. Improved computational and analytical approaches, alongside complementary experimental techniques are both required to achieve these goals.



This project also presents an excellent opportunity for the training of Highly Qualified Personnel.  Students will gain exposure to various aspects of modelling, simulation and computation, as well as improving their writing and presentation skills.  These valuable skills can then be applied to other projects in their future career.

"Experimental determination of interactions between cellular components, such as biochemical reactions, protein-protein and genetic interactions, charts a map of the cell. The interaction network map defines gene function and forms the basis for our models of biological processes. This knowledge will eventually enable us to predict phenotype from genotype, understand the genetic basis of disease and engineer new biological systems for industrial applications.



Recent biotechnology advances and the availability of completely sequenced genomes for hundreds of organisms has led to genome-scale mapping of networks of interacting proteins, genes and molecules. For instance, over 80,000 protein-protein, protein-DNA and genetic interactions for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been mapped using techniques such as yeast two-hybrid, chromatin immunoprecipitation on microarrays and immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry, with a significant contribution by Canadian research groups. Further, molecular profiling methods, such as RNA level measurement by microarray or protein quantitation by mass spectrometry, provide insight into the dynamic levels of cellular pathway components.



This extensive information about the cellular network demands the development of powerful computational tools to facilitate interpretation outside of the direct capacity of the human brain. I aim to address this by developing novel biological network analysis methods to discover new protein complexes, summarize dependency or buffering relationships between biological processes and find pathways that are active at specific life cycle states of the cell. Network analysis methods will help us, as biologists, effectively navigate the cell map at multiple levels of detail and use it to make new discoveries.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"The accurate modeling of financial objects is crucial for pricing and hedging various derivatives. Ideally one wants to find a model as simple as possible, which can capture most of the stylized features exhibited by the market data. There has been an extensive literature in the past decade, in both discrete and continuous time, trying to identify the 'right' model which then can be further used for dealing with the three pillars of finance: valuation, asset allocation, and risk management.



The main goal of this research is to address some important issues in two different research topics from financial mathematics. The first set of problems to be investigated  covers some general and specific topics in discrete and continuous time incomplete markets. For example, I will investigate the pricing performance of some new classes of non-normal GARCH models relative to the observed market quotes and analyze the connections between discrete and continuous time p-optimal martingale measures. The second direction is dedicated to pricing and hedging credit risk derivatives. For example, Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO) are one of the most interesting innovations of the securitization market in the recent years. They create new asset classes by allowing investors to share the risk and return of an underlying pool of debt obligation. Among some interesting problems I intend to address, also very important for practitioners, is hedging CDO tranches when the mark-to-market values of the tranches are modeled by various multivariate GARCH models.

 

This proposal highlights an interdisciplinary research program requiring nontrivial results from statistics, econometrics, probability, stochastic calculus, mathematical finance and actuarial science.

"Collective risk theory, as a part of insurance, deals with stochastic models of an insurance business. In such a model, the occurrence of the claims is described by a point process and the amount of money that an insurer has to pay due to a claim, as a random variable. Within this stochastic rather that deterministic view of the world, risk is a key concept. The probability of ruin, the surplus prior to ruin and the deficit at the time of ruin are just some of the quantities that measure the risk of an insurance business. 



In most of the real situations, it is of interest to be able to predict the outcome of some future events. In insurance, it is of huge importance to be able to predict the frequency of the claims and also the claim costs. Mathematical models are needed to help making these predictions, and as anticipated, the more realistic the model is, the more difficult is to analyze it. In particular, this research will focus on the analysis of several dependence structures that can be assumed within the framework of a risk model. The techniques involved may be applied in several applied probability areas, such as queuing theory, dams etc. Consequently, some of the results from other areas of research may be applied in Risk Theory as well.



The approach that I will apply is mainly based on matrix-analytic methods that developed considerably in the last few years. Comparison with the existing analytical approaches will be carried out, the differences being illustrated via numerical analysis primarily through computer-intensive calculations. The Gerber-Shiu discounted penalty function place the leading role in this analysis, possible extensions of this crucial quantity being one of the main goals of the proposed project.

"The proposed research program is aimed at the development of new approaches to producing organic interfaces that are laterally structured on the nanometer-to-micrometer length scales over macroscopic  areas. The spatially-directed assembly of nanostructures onto and patterning of surfaces is a subject of increasing interest because it is central to the continued progression in the miniaturization of electronic devices and to the development of novel nanoscale device concepts. Current top-down lithographic and printing methods each have limitations in terms of cost and accessibility, lateral feature size, parallel fabrication capability (throughput) or the type of materials that can be patterned. There is thus a real need for alternative methods that allow simple large-scale patterning of nanometer-to-micrometer size features. We are addressing this need by using the Langmuir-Blodgett film deposition technique, stereo- and chemoselective enzymatic surface transformations, and charge transfer interactions to assemble amphiphilic molecules (phospholipids, ionic surfactants, polyelectrolytes) and nanoparticles at solid/liquid interfaces in a controlled fashion. The research carried out within the time frame of the Discovery Grant is expected to have an impact in the fields of nanofabrication, membrane biophysics, colloidal chemistry, and materials science.","Sciences des mat�riaux","Avancement des connaissances","Anal. & Phys.

"In the next 25 years, the world will see unprecedented growth in the number of senior citizens, many of whom will have age-related impairments in memory and cognition like Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). These often result in people having difficulty remembering names of relatives and friends, and can lead to more severe cases of memory loss. While the health care system is gearing up to address this situation, resources will be strained. It is essential that Canada develop and study the effectiveness of assistive technologies designed to promote autonomous living. 



Towards this end, a research team from the University of Toronto and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center is developing a context-aware cell phone supported by wireless services that will permit seniors to organize and present information about people in their social network to help them better recall names. This collaborative effort includes computer scientists and medical and mental health professionals, as well as Bell Canada, whose technology will be used to develop the software system. The research team will then test the usefulness of this system for individuals with MCI.  We shall also survey a broader spectrum of the population to understand the more general utility of this technology, and carry out a pilot study of its use by business professionals.



If this research is successful, we expect to improve the productivity and quality of life of hundreds of thousands of Canadians and their family members and caregivers, and to identify the usefulness of using modern technologies to assist normally aging individuals who do not have cognitive impairments. This, in turn, may help governmental and health care professionals select and develop more appropriate assistive devices.   Bell Canada will benefit because these insights will inform the development and commercialization of wireless services for senior citizens and for other Canadians.

"Many food borne illnesses are caused by the pathogenic bacterium, Campylobacter jejuni.  In humans, infection with this organism can lead to severe abdominal cramping, headache, diarrhea and in extreme cases death.  C. jejuni infects 1% of the United States population annually.  Some of those affected can also develop an autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system that results in weakening of muscles and, in some cases, neurological problems.  



We are interested in developing therapeutic approaches to control and/or treat infections caused by the pathogen, Campylobacter jejuni.  In this proposal, we focus on a protein that resides on the surface of this pathogen, called CfrA.  Proper functioning of CfrA is essential for Campylobacter survival in the human intestine.  We have developed a system for expressing and purifying CfrA in the lab.  We now want to study the structure of CfrA and elucidate its functional properties.  We hope to identify unique structural and functional features that can be exploited to design pharmaceutical products that inhibit CfrA function, and thus kill the target pathogen, while leaving other beneficial micro-organisms untouched.

"Foodwebs in most ecosystems are sustained by plants. Consumption of living plant material is often minimal, and the bulk of the plant production enters the detrital, or non-living, carbon pool. Fungi and bacteria initiate incorporation of this detritus into food webs. Microbial decomposition is therefore a key process both for plants (through release of nutrients) and animals (by making plant litter more nutritious to consumers). 

In many streams, a specialized group of higher fungi, aquatic hyphomycetes, dominates decomposition of the most important source of plant remains, i.e., autumn-shed leaves. Invisible to the naked eye, they nevertheless make a major contribution to the nutrition of stream invertebrates and therefore indirectly to fish. In my proposed research, I intend to apply molecular techniques to more accurately determine which fungal species occur in various streams, and how their occurrence is influenced by the riparian vegetation, by water chemistry, and by geography.  

There is a growing concern that accelerating species extinction rates due to anthropogenic stresses jeopardizes functions and services of ecosystems. Aquatic fungal diversity is threatened by increased deposition of nitrogen, rising temperature, and pollutants such as heavy metals. Our proposed research will investigate the effects of such changes on fungal diversity and functions in streams, and potential consequences for the upper levels of the aquatic  food webs.

"Single cellular Fungi like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly known as baker's or brewing yeast, must respond to a myriad of environmental challenges in order to survive in the wild.  These challenges included changes in food/nutrient supplies and seasonal changes in weather.  Remarkably, fungi genomes (cellular DNA) are small and encode a limited number of proteins, yet fungi are able to successful deal with environmental changes.  Therefore a fundamental question of biology is how organism like yeast has adapted a limited number of proteins to perform multiple roles?  Using a high tech genomics and proteomics tools, which allow us to sort through thousands of yeast genes and proteins quickly; we aim to shed light on this fundamental question.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"The building codes in Canada and elsewhere are traditionally prescriptive in nature. A prescriptive code is one that specifies the design solutions and construction requirements according to particular materials and methods, rather than to performance criteria. As a result, the design process becomes highly regulated and complex. Performance Based Design (PBD) format has been evolving as an alternative to the current practice. PBD is expected to offer a more flexible framework for design to ensure safety and performance, and foster innovation in design by allowing the application of any acceptable and verifiable solution to achieve a given level of performance. The new edition of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC 2005) has made some progress in that direction and provided an objective-based format for design. However, the full framework for PBD of buildings is not yet available. The proposed research focuses on the performance-based seismic design (PBSD) of buildings. PBSD generally defines the target performance in terms of displacement and damage under specified levels of seismic hazard. While much research has been carried out in the recent past on PBSD, a number of issues, such as, availability of a robust mechanism for achieving PBSD within the constraints of the current building codes, and reliable and simplified methods for PBSD and seismic performance evaluation of buildings, remained unresolved. The proposed research will address these issues, and begin by evaluating the seismic provisions of NBCC 2005 to determine the seismic performance of the new buildings, and developing methods by which the performance of such buildings can be optimized. Reliable and simplified methods for PBSD of buildings will be developed for performance analysis under multiple levels of seismic hazard. Apart from the design of new buildings, the methods developed herein can also be potentially used for performance-based seismic upgrade of existing buildings. There is a significant potential for innovation in the proposed research which aims at enhancing the fundamental knowledge on earthquake resistant design and developing methodologies for designing economical and safer building structures.","G�nie des charpentes","Construction, urbanisme et am�nagement rural","Civil Engineering",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The successful developjment of efficient and reliable energy conversion for lithium-ion polymer-based battery systems is crucial for the next generation fo hybrid electric vehicles. The proposed research project will establish a collaborative relationship between Dr. Bahrami at SFU and Future Vehicle Technologies Inc. (FVT), a young R&D company that specializes in developing electric vehicles (EV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), and other electric drive train technologies.  FVT's engineers have now road-tested their 3rd generation high performance HEV prototype, the ""eVaro."" Powered by lithium-ion polymer-based batteries, the eVaro has achieved outstanding fuel efficiency averaging 250 mpge (miles per gallon equivalent) in city driving and 165 mpge on the highway. The eVaro also has sports car performance with a top speed of 135 mph. However, during high acceleration driving conditions, excessive currents pass through the battery electrode-collector bar junction. In extreme cases, these high currents can result in a meltdown of the entire electrode-collector assembly of the HEV prototype. Our preliminary investigation suggests that electrical contact resistance (ECR) at the interface between teh battery electrode and collector bar is the cause of this meltdown. In addition, the Ohmic nature of the ECR problem has a negative impact on the energy conversion in the battery system that reduces the vehicle's overall efficiency.  The funds requested will enable Dr. Bahrami and FVT to conduct a systematic investigation of the electrical (and thermal) contact resistance with the goal of minimizing the ECR.

FVT already plans to manufacture electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and related technologies in BC, Canada. This study will speed a solution to teh ECR problem that results in huge economic gains to BC and Canada because targeted high-efficiency energy storage technology is fully scalable. Therefore, innovations in this area will reduce our carbon footprint and transform all of our transportation industries (automotive, trains, marines, light aviation), sustainable energy systems (storage, integration to the grid), and the mining industry.","Autres ressources d'�nergie","Ressources d'�nergie","Pacific Internal Decision Committee",1,"EGP   ","Engage Grants Program                                                                               ","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Due to an intensive research thrust over the past 15 years, Micro-ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) have replaced, or can replace, many macro-scale transducers. These micromachined transducers use a variety of transduction mechanisms to convert different physical quantities to each other in order to provide the main system with the necessary data. However, fabrication techniques for micromachined devices are mainly optimized around a specific transduction mechanism. As a consequence, the growing number of systems that require multiple transducers need to use several individually fabricated devices.

   The objective of this research is to reduce the cost, size, complexity, and power consumption of a sensory system and improve its performance and reliability by integrating several of the necessary transducers on one chip. The challenges at the design, fabrication, and interfacing steps for these Integrated Multi-Transducer Systems (IMuTS) will be addressed with an emphasis on the integration of resonant transducers. The research will include the development of versatile fabrication process flows and their characterization. Several transducers will be designed and tested for given applications of IMuTS and their thermal responses will be characterized. The electrical, mechanical, and thermal behaviour of these devices will be modelled in order to facilitate the optimization of transducer designs. Moreover, resonant transducers will be designed with the aim of using a single resonator to infer information about more than one physical parameter by exploiting either the material anisotropies or the difference in the responses of various resonant modes of the structure. Interface circuits will be developed in standard CMOS processes with emphasis on low power design.

   This research plan, in addition to advancing the technological forefront, provides a learning framework for training of PhD and MSc students. These students will conduct the ground breaking research that will directly benefit numerous scientific and technological fields such as wireless sensor networks, implanted biomedical devices, structural health monitoring, and automotive safety.","Machinerie et �quipement �lectriques et �lectroniques (y compris mat�riel informatique)","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Electrical and Computer Engineering",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"We continue to use various techniques to study gradings on algebras: associative, Lie, Jordan and respective superalgebras. Most of these techniques are connected to Hopf algebras, hyperalgebras and group schemes, and work effectively in the case of finite-dimensional algebras over fields of arbitrary characteristic. We will continue using functional identities, which are an effective tool in the case, where the algebras of sufficiently large dimension, and the coefficients need not be in a field. We will pay more attention to various classes of nonassociative algebras which will help us in the study of gradings on exceptional Lie algebras. We plan to continue studying graded identities on associative and Lie algebras since they turn out to be an effective sustitute of ordinary polynomial identities which are very hard to determine even in the simplest cases of matrix algebras. We will continue our research of the growth of various algebraic objects, like groups, associative and Lie algebras, their actions and modules, with the goal of constructing the objects close to free by their growth and still satisfying interesting finiteness conditions. This is important for the constructions arising in the study of Burnside-type problems. We will continue working in the area of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and superalgebras, in particular, locally finite algebras, having in mind infinite-dimensional simple Lie algebras, their structure and representations.

"Gap junction channels are specialized membrane pore structures between cells, allowing ions and small signalling molecules in one cell to pass on to the neighbour cells. The building blocks for gap junction channels are a group of transmembrane proteins called connexins (Cx). 20 different types of connexins are identified in rodents. Six identical connexins or different connexins form a cylinder-shaped half channel known as a hemichannel. Back-to-back linking of two hemichannels forms a complete gap junction channel. Communication through gap junction channels is essential for synchronized, coordinated cellular activities and exchanging small molecules between cells in tissues. The gap junction channel pore size, the switch control for opening/closing, and the chemical sensitivities are different depending on the connexin subtypes that organize the channel. This proposal aims to reveal which part of the connexin molecule is responsible for the distinct functional properties of the neuronal connexin, Cx36. We plan to engineer several parts of Cx36 into Cx50, an eye lens connexin, to form chimera proteins. These chimera proteins will be expressed into cells for functional test of gap junction channel properties. Further subdivision of positively identified parts will be used to track down the minimum amino acid residue(s) required to display unique functional properties. The proposed research will assist us in understanding the molecular mechanisms in the control of opening/closing of these important channels and the molecular determinants for the ability of the channel to conduct ions. A comprehensive knowledge of structure-function relationships for gap junction molecules in neurons is critical in understanding the functions of these channels in synchronized brain activities.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Podophyllotoxin and saponins are natural medicinal compounds which have anticancer activity as well as other important pharmacological functions. Considering continuously growing demands for medicinal and nutraceutical products including podophyllotoxin and saponins in North America, the development of more efficient extraction processes would meet an urgent commercial demand.

We propose that the extraction of natural medicinal compounds (i.e. podophyllotoxin and saponins) can be significantly improved with the aid of radio frequency (RF) heating and pulsed electric field (PEF) assisted extraction resulting in higher product yields at reduced extraction time and solvent consumption with high energy efficiency. RF heating is an emerging heating technology which provides uniform volumetric internal heating within a packed-bed solvent extraction unit at commercial scales (up to meters in diameter). Uniform internal heating of all particles and the solvent in the packed-bed extraction unit results in uniform solubility of the solute in the solvent. RF heating might improve mass diffusion because mass diffusivity increase with extraction temperature exponentially. In PEF-assisted extraction, the differential electric pressure between the cell interior and the exterior of the cell membranes is so large that the cell membranes are damaged. Therefore the most important resistance to solute transfer, the cell wall, becomes permeable to the solute and then the difrusivity and solubility increase. A combinational approach of RF-PEF assisted extraction can synergistically enhance the solvent extraction of natural medicinal compounds, including podophyllotoxin and saponins. To achieve high efficiencies in RF-PEF assisted packed-bed solvent extraction of bio-components (i.e. podophyllotoxin and saponins) the research project will involve experimental apparatus development, characterization of RF and PEF extraction processes, characterization of hinm^teriql properti^ experimental procedures for RF-PEF assisted packed-bed solvent extraction techniques, comparison with other extraction methods, and modeling, simulation and optimization of RF-PEF process.

"Radio Frequency (RF) heating is an emerging heating technology which provides uniform volumetric internal heating within large volume food and biomaterials (up to meters in diameter) and high energy efficiency. RF has not been comprehensively investigated in the food/bioprocessing domain compared to others such as textile, plastic and wood processing. The objective of this research program is to apply extensive engineering studies and obtain meaningful experimental data, and so to enable the reliable design of RF heating processes and systems which provide improved quality of product and reduced operating costs. 

RF dielectric properties of food and biomaterials will be measured and analysed with different levels of sample temperature, chemical composition (water, salts and fat) and porosity. Mathematical models for RF heating, the simultaneous ""multi-physics"" problem will be developed and numerically simulated on a personal computer platform. The experimental data on transport phenomena will be gathered for the validation of the developed model. After modeling, the effects of independent parameters will be examined with sensitivity analysis for reliable design of processes and equipment for optimum RF heating. Dynamic color, viscoelastic behaviour, and textural parameters will be measured with different RF heating rates. The experimental data will be used for the estimation of the kinetic parameters during RF heating. The order of reaction, reaction-rate constant and activation energy will be determined using a Genetic Algorithm. Hybrid applications will be tested with simultaneous treatment and multi-step treatment. The simultaneous treatment will be conducted with forced convection-RF and vacuum-RF. For multi-step treatment, RF preheat (beginning), RF boost (middle), and RF finish (late) depending on the stage at which RF heating is introduced to the process. For each combination, quality parameters, transport phenomena, and energy consumption will be studied. Then optimized processes for specific products could be suggested.

"Les gam�tes porcins sont particuli�rement sensibles au refroidissement, donc la conservation de la semence et des ovocytes aux basses temp�ratures ne s'applique pas � la production porcine actuelle. Notre hypoth�se g�n�rale est que les mol�cules uniques augmenteraient la r�sistance des gam�tes porcins au froid et m�neraient au d�veloppement de nouvelles techniques pour les conserver.

Notre premi�re hypoth�se sp�cifique est que modifier la composition de la membrane plasmique stabiliserait les spermatozo�des et les ovocytes contre les changements de temp�rature. Les gam�tes porcins sont sensibles au froid parce que leur membrane plasmique est compos�e d'un faible ratio de cholest�rol par rapport aux phospholipides. On utilisera la cyclodextrine, un oligom�re de glucose, pour livrer du cholest�rol exog�ne aux membranes des spermatozo�des et des ovocytes afin d'augmenter leur r�sistance aux temp�ratures froides.

Notre deuxi�me hypoth�se sp�cifique est que le tr�halose prot�gerait les spermatozo�des et les ovocytes durant la cryoconservation. Le tr�halose est un disaccharide naturel compos� de deux mol�cules de glucose synth�tis� par les bact�ries et par les levures afin de se prot�ger contre le choc au froid. Les mammif�res n'en fabriquent pas, cependant ce sucre a d�j� �t� utilis� comme cryoprotecteur de cellules de mammif�res. On incorporera le tr�halose (ou un autre disaccharide, le sucrose, comme contr�le) dans un dilueur de semence pour mieux cryoconserver les spermatozo�des porcins. Dans une autre s�rie d'exp�riences, on �valuera l'impact de tr�halose intra- et extracellulaire sur la tol�rance des ovocytes porcins � la cong�lation.

Le but ultime du projet est d'offrir � l'industrie porcine canadienne des protocoles pour entreposer � long terme

"Long term cryogenic storage facilities are an essential resource for short term and long term storage of our C. elegans strains, large collection of fosmids, cosmids, a C. elegans ORFeome library, and an effectively complete C. elegans RNAi library.  C. elegans can be stored for many years (at least 30 years) and recovered for further analysis, which has been a key reason why C. elegans has been widely used in important biomedical research projects and major biological discoveries.  In addition, frozen strains do not undergo DNA replication thereby lowering a probability of accumulating unwanted mutations as can happen when strains are maintained for long periods on plates.  The number of strains generated and stored by the three applicants is on the order of 13,000 with new strains being generated continuously.  The large collection of strains, which has been established since the nematode C. elegans was identified as a model organism in the early 1970s, by itself represents a precious resource for research and discovery for the applicants, as well as C. elegans researchers in Canada and abroad. Maintaining these strains without adequate cryogenic storage would be expensive, formidable, and risky since many precious strains could be lost. We three research groups together request funds for an ultra-low temperature refrigerator and two liquid Nitrogen storage tanks to replace our ultra-low temperature refrigerators, which are approaching the end of their expected life-spans, and to store newly generated C. elegans strains and many thousands of molecular DNA constructs.  The current cryogenic storage facilities for all three laboratories are filled close to their capacities and in addition, the loss of an ultra-low temperature freezer without a storage facility to move strains to would result in the loss of a large number of valuable strains accumulated over many years.

"Packera, a genus of 50+ species in the Asteraceae (Daisy) family, is an ideal group for studies aimed at understanding the evolutionary history of the North American flora because (i) it is widespread in North America, with species occurring in all the major biomes (ii) many of the species are poorly defined due to apparent hybridization and introgression so that patterns of hybridization and resulting gene flow can both be examined in a range of historical and geographical contexts and (iii) high levels of intrapopulational chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) haplotype diversity provide a source of molecular markers than can be analyzed in a phylogenetic context. Packera originated in Mexico and has diversified there, in the Great Plains, the arctic and along the North American west coast. We will examine evolutionary patterns in all these regions to better assess the role of geographical isolation, natural selection, hybridization, refugial survival and species migration in the evolution of the flora. We will examine molecular divergence of both nuclear and cpDNA from the two Mexican mountain ranges where Packera diverged to determine whether this, followed by northern migration and widespread hybridization would explain the basis for the cpDNA diversity observed in many northern taxa. In the arctic, we will assess the importance of refugial survival followed by migration and recent hybridization, while in the Great Plains, we believe widespread species show patterns of high haplotype diversity that may be interpretable in the context of post-glacial migration patterns and resultant hybridization among newly overlapping species. Along the west coast two factors appear important; (i) serpentine soils have shaped the evolution of numerous plant groups including Packera by exerting selection for edaphic tolerance among colonizers and (ii) various coastal refugia may have provided a source of genetic diversity for post-glacial colonizing species throughout this region.  Our phylogeographic studies of Packera over the next five years, will improve our understanding of the evolutionary importance of all of these factors and thereby greatly improve our understanding of factors affecting the evolution of the North American flora.

"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the single most effective analytical tool used by synthetic chemists for the determination of molecular structure. In this proposal, we seek to replace the autosampler for the introduction of routine samples to a Mercury 400 MHz NMR spectrometer located in the NMR Facility at the University of Western Ontario.  The autosampler is critical to the efficient operation of the spectrometer and supports the research of approximately 100 highly qualified personnel. The autosampler enables the operation of the instrument 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is essential for the research programs to operate at a world class level.

"For this CC/NSERC New Media Initiative, choreographer/media artist Henry Daniel, mathematician Peter Borwein, and engineers Ivan Bajic and lie Liang will collaborate on the development of systems and algorithms for advanced video coding and processing that will reduce both delay and bandwidth required for distributed dance performance, while improving the overall experience for performing artists using 3-D scene acquisition and representation. Concurrent with these activities, two major contemporary dance works and several smaller projects will be created, working collaboratively with partners in the UK, North and South America, and Asia utilizing the ADAPT network (Association of Dance and Performance Telematics). The overall goal is to push the level of the telepresence experience and interactivity beyond what is currently offered by even the most sophisticated collaboration environments, while exploring the cultural implications of these activities as content within the works themselves.

This proposal builds on the findings of a two-year (2003-2005) Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) sponsored Research Development Initiative (RDI), which established Transnet (Transdisciplinary Network for Performance and Technology) as an international network of researchers interested in exploring intersections between disciplines, especially between the arts and sciences, using dance, performance, and new technologies.","Syst�mes et services de communications (planification, organisation et services)","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","New Media Initiative",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"The current loss of biodiversity on the planet and the need for conservation of life forms depends on having a stable classification of living organisms based on their evolutionary relationships.  Although birds are thought to be well studied taxonomically, the base of the avian tree of life remains unresolved despite attempts with large DNA and morphological data sets. The cause of this problem is that some time after the K/T extinction event 65 Mya the major clades underwent rapid radiations that make it extremely difficult to reconstruct their branching order, and how they are related by shared common ancestry. Thus it is impossible to elucidate fundamental evolutionary properties of birds such as rates of evolution through time, tempo and mode of lineage diversification and speciation, historical biogeography, evolution of genome size, and ecology and evolutionary biology. A completely new approach is called for to resolve higher relationships among orders and families of birds, and create a stable classification in which the basic units of evolution (species) can be placed and studied in a comparative framework. Retroposon insertions have proved spectacularly successful in resolving the hotly debated deeper branches in the mammal tree of life, mostly because of the number of complete genome sequences that can be scanned for phylogenetically informative insertions. Only the chicken genome sequence is available in birds, severely limiting the application of retroposons in bird phylogeny. Using an innovative new technique of retroposon enrichment and genome walking pioneered in my laboratory we have overcome this difficulty in birds without having to resort to prohibitively expensive genome sequencing. In the past 18 months we have detected and used unique retroposon insertions to resolve difficult relationships in the basal paleognath birds (ratites and tinamous) thus providing proof-of-concept. We therefore propose to resolve the problematic branching pattern at the base of the entire bird tree of life using unique insertions because they are almost error-free markers of phylogenetic relationships. Not only will this be a world first but it will enable comparative evolutionary studies of birds highly relevant to their conservation.

"The research program addresses two areas. One is the synthesis of zeolite films on conductive electrodes. Zeolites are mineral-like materials  with a honeycombed network of tiny cavities. This may have applications in the development of new types of chemical sensors. Thes are devices that can sense a particular chemical (like your nose does). The second research project is directed toward the develoment of a chemical sensor for Arsenic. Arsenic poisoning is rampant in the third world (particulary Bangladesh) where geological deposits of Arsenic are leaching into drinking water supplies. We are examining various materials with a view to developing an on-chip portable sensor.

"Organofluorine compounds are useful as anesthetics, refrigerants, propellants for drug delivery, foam-blowing agents, water- and stain-repellants, lubricants and non-flammable solvents. While many of these compounds are non-toxic, they tend to persist in the environment and their manufacturing processes often involve significant quantities of toxic reagents such as chloro-alkenes and heavy metals such as antimony. In this research program, new metal organo-fluorine chemistry will be investigated with an eye to developing 'green' catalyzed routes to these important compounds. The chemistry will focus on easily prepared complexes of earth-abundant metals such as iron and nickel to mediate reactions of hydrofluoroalkenes generated by in situ reduction of non-toxic precursors. The resulting range of hydrofluorocarbon products will share many of the useful properties of perfluorocarbons but the reactive C-H bonds will guarantee their more rapid environmental degradation. Fluoropolymers such as Teflon and Viton also have many important uses such as non-stick coatings, heat- and wear-resistant seals and gaskets, fireproof insulation and 'breathable' clothing. These polymers are currently prepared using radical initiators either at high pressures or as aqueous emulsions using environmentally problematic surfactants such as perfluorooctanoic acid. This research program will conduct an in-depth study of the generation and reactivity of metal fluoro- and organo-fluorocarbene complexes (M=CHR, R = F, fluoroalkyl) to identify new catalysts for preparation of fluoropolymers with stereodefined microstructure. Exciting technical and intellectual challenges for the students include synthesis of air- and water-sensitive materials, sometimes at low temperatures, and hands-on access to rapid throughput experimentation, electrochemistry and computational chemistry facilities within the Centre for Catalysis Research and Innovation.

"Laboratory scale smooth open channel flow can be considered to be the simplest flow field in hydraulic engineering.  However, this flow exhibits many of the phenomena that occur in complex turbulent flows. To understand complex flow fields, researchers have studied the response of the standard smooth bed flow to changing boundary conditions which are imposed in many different forms (such as change in bed roughness).  It is also noteworthy that empirical relations established from very simple flows at laboratory scales are often employed far beyond their established range of validity in the more complex flow fields.  This is particularly disconcerting as there has been a proliferation in the use of commercial computational codes which use the empirical relations.  For e.g., there is considerable work which attempts to relate river bed form roughness to sand grain roughness employed in classical experiments. Most practical open channel flows occur on rough (mobile/immobile) beds with or without seepage (suction/injection).  While the distribution of the mean velocities and shear stress is well documented, the role of turbulent structures is less known.  Several critical questions arise while modeling practical flows.  These include: How does roughness geometry (height, spacing, density etc.) determine the size and frequency of the larger turbulent eddies responsible for bulk of the transport?  How are the conventional laws and role of coherent structures modified in the presence of seepage and bed mobility?  The present proposal will systematically address these and other important questions by conducting numerical simulation and laboratory experiments on selected roughness geometry with well defined flow conditions including seepage effects.   The goal of this proposal is to study the instantaneous, time-evolving coherent structures and how they are affected by the proximity of the bed/free surface.  The velocity fields will be examined using proper-orthogonal decomposition, momentum analysis, and conditional quadrant analysis.  The study is made possible by the availability of state-of-the-art experimental facilities and numerical codes at the University of Windsor.

"Our computing environments are increasingly diversifying to include displays with a variety of sizes, resolutions, and form-factors. In terms of size and resolution, these range from tiny low-resolution displays found on watches to gigantic high-resolution wall-size displays driven by multiple tiled projectors. Form factors are also increasingly varied, ranging from highly portable displays that can be used in any location, position and orientation, to more static displays used in either a horizontal (e.g., tabletop) or vertical format. In addition, projectors are getting increasingly smaller, allowing users to create dynamic displays of variable size at any location. Despite this diversity in displays, the user interfaces we currently use differ very little regardless of the display's characteristics, and tend to rely on one or at most two channels of input (e.g., keyboard and mouse/pen) with limited degrees-of-freedom. Furthermore, current user interfaces do not support the seamless use of multiple heterogeneous displays in a coherent holistic manner. The net result is that users are unable to utilize the multiple displays in their computing environment to their fullest potential. The proposed research intends to develop multi channel and multi degree-of-freedom user input and interaction techniques to allow users to work effectively in computational environments consisting of a variety heterogeneous displays. The research will investigate user interfaces for single person use, as well as interfaces to support multiple people working collaboratively in such environments. In addition to explicit interaction, we also intend to focus on techniques for more ambient and subtle interaction in these spaces.

"Canada's water supply is under threat due to diminishing quantities of clean, non-toxic water for supporting wildlife and also for domestic livestock such as cattle. In some parts of Canada, high concentrations of sulphur compounds are responsible for creating environments toxic to many species. These include mine affected environments such as mine pit lakes and tailing ponds. In other areas, such as the Okanagan, BC, there is a shortage of drinking water for cattle due to naturally high sulphate concentrations. In addition, some stratified lakes high in sulphide have very low diversities and are uninhabitable by fish. Thus, our work is directed at studying biological and other environmental factors that regulate sulphur cycling in these systems with a view to developing in situ bioremediation strategies for improving water quality. 

In our previous work, we have adopted genomic tools for studying the microbiology in high-sulphate systems. These include the use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction to estimate sulphate-reducing bacteria abundance, and small subunit ribosomal RNA clone libraries for determining the most ecologically important species present. This information is correlated to water chemistry and the availability of organic matter in order to understand what environmental factors lead to high sulphate and sulphide environments. 

In our proposed work, we will study these environmental factors in stratified lakes, such as mine pit lakes, and high sulphate ponds, such as are found in the Okanagan, BC. We will determine the main metabolic processes in these high sulphate and sulphide environments and will compare and contrast them with low sulphate systems that are in close proximity so as to understand why they are so different. We will identify bacterial species present and bring samples back to the laboratory where we can perform experiments to test out different strategies for reducing sulphate and sulphide. In the long term, we propose to test in situ bioremediation strategies in the field.

"The research involves complementary numerical and experimental investigations of fluid flow and heat transfer phenomena in energy conversion, exchange, and storage systems. Five projects are proposed: (1) Control-Volume Finite Element Methods (CVFEMs); (2) Loop Heat Pipes; (3) Convective Heat Transfer with Slurries of Microencapsulated Phase-Change Materials (MCPCMs); (4) Flow and Heat Transfer in Interrupted-Surface Ducts; and (5) Transport Phenomena in Porous Media.

     The computational investigations will emphasize novel aspects related to the following phenomena and/or techniques: (i) higher-order schemes and adaptive grids for CVFEMs; (ii) optimization; (iii) integration of network and detailed local thermofluid models; (iv) convective heat transfer with MCPCM slurries; (v) temporally- and spatially-periodic flows; (vi) fluid flow and heat transfer in adjacent open and porous domains; and (vii) steady solid-liquid phase change in porous media. In the complementary experimental work, a mix of the following instrumentation and/or techniques will be employed: (i) computer-based data acquisition; (ii) thermocouples; (iii) pressure transducers; (iv) thermal anemometry; (v) shadowgraphy; (vi) surface streamline, dye and particle injection; (vii) semitransparent thin-film heaters and liquid crystal sheets; and (viii) digital photography and image processing.

     The inspiration and guidance for the proposed research are derived from the following applications: solar, wind, and geothermal energy systems; solid-liquid latent-heat energy storage and thermal control devices; industrial gas turbine engines; heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems; materials processing systems; and electronics cooling systems. The underlying themes in each of the proposed projects are practically viable mathematical models, cost-effective numerical solution methods, and thermal performance optimization. The long-range goal of this work is to contribute to the development of cleaner and more efficient energy conversion, exchange, and storage systems.

"Individuals with little or no functional speech, gesture, or writing

due to underlying physical disorder may instead use a computational

device, called a Voice Output Communication Aid (VOCA), to produce

synthetic speech (synthesized or digitized).  This device affords

another, albeit aided, mode of communication.  Empirical evidence

shows that this mode is a complement to, and not a replacement for,

the other, unaided modes, such as vocalization, facial expression and

gaze, and gestures of the hand, head and torso.  Thus, the evaluation

and design of VOCAs must take into consideration not only the issue of

rate of output (e.g., words-per-minute) but also issues that relate to

the utility of the individual's entire repertoire of mode strategies,

of which synthesized speech is but one component.



The goal of this program of research is to develop better VOCAs

through the development of software techniques and modelling tools

that take into account this ""global"" context.  The research will focus

on the contrastive evaluation of unimodal and multimodal interface

variants, and the use of design principles based on information

theory.  The formal and theoretical analyses will be validated by

empirical studies.

"The purpose of this research program is to identify the factors that are responsible for the survival of injured cells in the retina of the eye.  The overall aim is to identify basic mechanisms inside injured cells and in their surrounding environment that limit their survival and regeneration after injury.  Injection of endothelin-1 (ET-1) into the rat eye results in the specific injury of retinal ganglion cells, leading to progressive blindness.  Whether a retinal ganglion cell lives or dies in response to such stress depends on a delicate balance of survival factors inside the cell as well as influences from neighboring cells.  Our first specific aim is to demonstrate that the protein optineurin is critical for proper signaling of the survival factor Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).  It is our hypothesis that impaired BDNF signaling will decrease the ability of retinal ganglion cells to cope with ET-1 induced stress.  Our second specific aim is to examine the influences of microglial cells on retinal ganglion cell survival after ET-1 injury.  Previously thought to function as pro-inflammatory mediators of cell death, microglia are now thought to protect nerve cells soon after injury.  We will examine retinal ganglion cell survival after ET-1 injury in retinas where microglia have been alternatively stimulated or inhibited.  These two aims will identify new therapeutic targets for improving nerve cell survival after injury in the central nervous system, as well as the retina.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Integrative Animal Biology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Within the realm of particle physics the description of nature on the submicroscopic scale has evolved into the so-called Standard Model.  This is a set of rules which specifies the basic constituents of our Universe and the forces that act between them.  At ISAC, studies of the decay of radioactive isotopes are being pursued to obtain a better understanding of these fundamental forces in nature.  Most radioactive isotopes decay by the simultaneous emission of two energetic particles a beta (i.e. an electron) and a neutrino.  Our present understanding of the weak interaction (the force that causes nuclear beta decay) predicts that for a very few special isotopes the decay properties should be identical and related in a simple way to the vector component of the weak force.  Precision measurements of the decay rate for these so-called superallowed Fermi beta decays can be used to test this hypothesis and to determine the strength of the force.  The current world data on superallowed Fermi beta decay leads to a result that provides one of the most precise tests of the Standard model.   However, this result also depends on small but very important corrections that must be computed before the test can be applied.  The TRIUMF-ISAC facility provides beams of these special radioactive isotopes over a wider mass range than was previously available.  This allows us to further test the model and to validate the corrections that must be applied.

"Les propri�t�s m�caniques du contact b�ton-rocher sont g�n�ralement le facteur dominant dans l'�tude de stabilit� d'un barrage poids en b�ton.

"This proposal covers a broad range of topics involving the mathematical and experimental modelling of fluid flow, with applications in the geosciences, engineering and elsewhere. Three specific examples are:

(1) ""Viscoplastic fluids"" possess an extensive microscopic structure that generates a macroscopic internal strength; only when forced sufficiently strongly will the structure yield to allow the material to flow like a fluid. Such materials are widespread in fields ranging from the oil and gas industries, to food processing and geophysics. Problems of current interest include how viscoplastic fluids flow and come to rest under gravity (as in a dam break experiment), and how the classical problems of hydrodynamic stability are modified by viscoplasticity (e.g. the onset of convection in a heated fluid). The proposed research aims to build state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical tools for these problems and more.

(2) Although the mathematical techniques of geophysical fluid dynamics are traditionally applied in oceanography and atmospheric science, many other problems in the geosciences can be attacked using those methods, such as magma and lava flow.  Outstanding issues include what is the mechanism behind volcanic tremor (the ground vibrations that are linked to magma flow and sometimes precede eruptions), how do crystals affect convection in magma chambers (which affects volcanic activity), and how can one model the interaction between flowing lava and its solidified skin?

(3) For almost a hundred years it was thought that the tides were dissipated chiefly in shallow seas. Recent satellite observations, however, have show conclusively that tides are also damped in the deep ocean, above topography on the ocean floor, where the tide is converted into internal gravity waves. Key issues that are not yet fully resolved are how much energy is thereby extracted from the tide, and what subsequently happens to the waves? Can the waves break down into turbulence to provide the mixing needed to explain observations of tracer diffusion, to maintain the ocean's stratification, and to energize its large-scale circulation?

"The bewildering variety of structure in the Universe around us today is one of the biggest mysteries in astronomy.  How did a Universe that started off so simply, as smoothly distributed hydrogen gas, produce galaxies with such a wide range of shapes, sizes and ages, arranged in a complex, web-like structure?  More specifically puzzling is the fact that some unknown agent has been acting to prevent stars and galaxies from forming. This mechanism must not be equally efficient everywhere, or at all times, in order to give rise to the variety of galaxies we see today.  As time goes on, galaxies gather together into groups, and evidence is mounting that it is within this group environment that galaxies undergo the profound change that renders them unable to form new stars.  My research is aimed at improving our understanding of these poorly studied systems, to help identify and quantify the interesting astrophysics that we know must be present.   Through careful observations and theoretical modeling I expect to be able to characterise the timescale over which star formation activity is shut off in groups, and how this might depend on the group mass or surrounding environment.  As galaxy groups are the most common environment today, and as their abundance changes greatly with time, the results of this research will have profound consequences for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in general.

"Plant species distributions are the product of a variety of factors including local environmental conditions,  regional processes, historical events, and climatic conditions. Specific plant traits (e.g., resource use  efficiencies, metabolic costs, tissue turnover, etc.) have been linked to species distributions along single  resource gradients repeatedly and play a crucial role in determining species success as a function of abiotic  resource availability. Despite extensive work in this area, our knowledge is limited with respect to potential  trade-offs underlying the ability to tolerate scarcity or excess of one resource versus that of another. Likewise,  it is not clear whether similar traits and tradeoffs dictate species distributions across spatial scales. The main  objective of the proposed research will be the determination of plant traits that contribute to species  distributions both locally and geographically and the relationships among relevant traits and trade-offs at these  two scales in three main systems: tropical and temperate forests and coastal marshlands. Research will fall into  two main topics: (1) Determination of mechanistic bases of local distribution (i.e., habitat preference) vs.  geographic distribution (i.e., range size); and (2) Quantification of multiple resource tolerance trade-off  surfaces. For each component of the study detailed investigation of trait plasticity and performance in relation  to a variety of resource gradients will be monitored. This will allow for a cross-system examination of local and regional distributions as a function of plasticity of traits and therefore result in more broadly applicable results.  Quantification of resistance trade-offs and relationships between local and geographic species distributions will provide the framework for assessing species suitability for restoration efforts in degraded systems such as the  Acadian forests of Eastern Canada. Finally, understanding determinants of range size may provide new insights into mechanisms enabling the spread of invasive species.",Environnement,"D�veloppement du nord","Evolution & Ecology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","New Brunswick",Nouveau-Brunswick

"Organic electronic and optoelectronic devices are of great interest and promise because of flexibility of

depositing organic films on various substrates and the relative ease of processing of organic compounds that

are being engineered in numerous research labs. Significant progress has been made in realizing different

functions by using organic materials for low-cost devices, such as organic field-effect transistors, organic

light-emitting diodes and displays, and thin film organic photovoltaic cells, to name a few. The integration of

organic materials with inorganic materials to make hybrid devices is one of several options that are thought to

offer hope for not only extending performance but increasing functionality as well as lowering cost. This new

device scheme can bring in the vast capabilities of synthetic chemistry into the realm of novel electronic/

optoelectronic devices and take advantage of the rich phenomena of self-organization, self-assembly and

area-specific growth of organic materials. The objectives of this proposal are (1) to develop organic/inorganic

hybrid devices for infrared to visible light optical upconversion applications through direct tandem integration;

(2) to develop a comprehensive knowledge on the underlying physics of the organic/inorganic

hetero-integration, including the interfacial states and carrier injection at the interfaces between organic

molecular layers and inorganic semiconductor and between organic molecular layers and metal contact layers;

and (3) to design and prototype infrared imaging devices based on optical upconversion for practical

applications. The proposed project will provide a broad base of new knowledge on organic-inorganic

hetero-integration that could lead to new functionalities and applications of organic materials and devices, such

as night vision for military/civilian applications, covert surveillance, range finding, and semiconductor wafer

inspection. This research will have profound technological impacts in the areas of information acquisition,

safety, security and medical imaging. The intellectual property stemming from this research will benefit the

knowledge-based economy of Canada and is expected to have critical impacts on start-up companies.","Technologie de l'instrumentation","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Safety and Security",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario

2. Methods - i) supercomputer simulations beyond Born-Oppenheimer approximation of electron-nuclear dynamics in intense laser fields.  ii) Analytic semiclassical models in strong fields, and optimum control algorithms of augmented Lagrangean type.  iii) Maxwell-Schroedinger numerical algorithms on parallel supercomputers for pulse propagation in molecular media.

3. Objectives - Exploring via large scale computations and simulations new applications of ultrashort intense laser pulses to controlling and imaging electron and nuclear dynamics in chemical reactions, to laser control and manipulation of molecules.

4. Summary - The nonlinear nonperturbative interaction of molecules with ultrashort intense laser pulses requires large scale simulations due to the nonseparability of electron-nuclear motion in this regime.  Furthermore there is overlap of time-scales of electron-nuclear dynamics, from femto to attoseconds especially for the case of proton motion.  Algorithms and models will be developped for parallel supercomputers to investigate the interaction of molecules with intense-ultrashort laser pulses leading to new applications of the current advanced laser technology under the above extreme conditions for :

i) generation and application of high order harmonics; ii) attosecond pulse generation and applications to electron control; iii) light manipulation and strong field molecular control of photochemical processes; iv) adaptive molecular control; v) relativistic effects in future ultrastrong fields.

"Optical networks use interconnections of high-speed broadband fibers to transmit information using optical transmitters and receivers. Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) allows multiple communication

channels to operate at different carrier frequencies on a single fiber. The rapidly growing WWW is crucially dependant on fast and reliable communication. The growing complexity of WDM networks makes the possibility of faults in networks a very important problem. Even brief interruption of data communication represents the loss of a huge amount of data.  In this investigation, we will look at the following problems on network survivability and the design of optical networks:



- When designing a network, how to ensure that any single fault can be handled using as little additional resources as possible?



- How to design networks in such a way that, when a fault occurs, communication using an backup path can be resumed very fast?



- What is an economical way to allot low-speed user requests for communication to the high-speed capability of optical communication?

"As demand for minerals, metals, and petroleum from emerging economies in Asia and Eastern Europe cause world prices to soar, increased emphasis is being placed on Earth sciences for the exploration of natural resources. Canada is positioned to be a leader in providing these commodities to world markets. Over the last decade, it has become increasingly apparent that there is an immediate pressure for the discovery and development of new energy sources to meet the demands of our changing world. Uranium is an important natural resource that is abundant in Canada that can be utilized to our advantage. With vast reserves in the Canadian North, it is crucial that exploration, research, and development of uranium deposits are carried out to aid development of the Canadian economy.  The proposed research project aims to:

     1.   Document and quantify the genesis and processes controlling the geological and hydrothermal formation of the historical Lac Cinquante uranium deposit located in Nunavut.

     2.  Develop a 3D subsurface model of the Lac Cinquante deposit to understand the genetic relationship to hydrothermal circulation systems responsible for its formation.

     3.  Understand the controls on hydrothermal fluid flow associated with the Lac Cinquante and other Beaverlodge style uranium deposits in Canada and worldwide to develop new geochemical exploration tools for application in Canada's north.

     Canada must continue to strengthen its knowledge base, encourage world-class research, and encourage industry-academic partnerships investigating important natural resources in order to become a world leader in alternative energy sources.  This project aims to increase exploration in the Canadian North, train and guide highly qualified personnel (HQP), and create jobs for these Canadian HQPs at exploration and mining camps in Northern Canada.","Ressources d'�nergie (production, exploration, traitement, distribution et utilisation de l'�nergie)","Ressources d'�nergie","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Ontario,Ontario
"Picture a world before the dinosaurs when plants and animals hadn't evolved yet. Where volcanoes gave birth to new land and spewed toxic gases into an oxygen free atmosphere. Where the continents were just being born and where the oceans were almost free of life except for tiny single celled organisms. But what was there to eat? Look a little deeper. In the cracks and crevices of the rocks deep beneath the seafloor seawater seeps down into the rocks and acts like a nutrient highway. In these deep, dark, watery places microbes have been found that colonize glassy lavas and can extract nutrients from this unlikely food source. The lavas are continuously erupted at undersea volcanoes that form mountain chains beneath the sea like seams on a baseball. These mid-ocean ridges are dynamic environments where globally significant chemical, biological, and heat fluxes occur between the Earth's crust, overlying oceans, and atmosphere. Chemical exchange between heated circulating fluids and the oceanic crust leads to major changes in the chemical composition of the oceanic basement. The formation of new oceanic crust at ridge axes and the reincorporation of aged crust into the mantle at subduction zones are perhaps the most fundamental components of the plate tectonic cycle. These processes control the physiography of the Earth and the chemical and thermal evolution of the crust and mantle. The guiding principle of the proposed research is the investigation of water-rock-microbial alteration of oceanic crust through billions of years of Earth history. This is an emerging field that has only been recognized in the last decade. The temperature and depth limits of microbiological activity deep beneath the seafloor have yet to be explored, but microbial activity occurring in the submarine deep biosphere may have a profound impact on chemical fluxes during water-rock reactions and possibly hold the key to the development of life on the Earth and other planets.","Sciences de la terre","Avancement des connaissances","Solid Earth Sciences",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"During the past six years my research has focused on developing power and performance optimization techniques for modern processors. I have introduced several power and performance optimization techniques for both high-performance and embedded processors.

My future research includes both short-term and long-term goals. In the short-term, I will continue investigating eliminating redundant instructions and the potential power reduction benefits.  I will investigate methods that eliminate unnecessary computations and study their effect on power dissipation. In addition, I will extend our previous work and investigate the effect of eliminating redundant operations in simultaneous multithreaded (SMT) processors. My second short-term goal is to extend our previous work on dynamic resource allocation and investigate reconfigurable cache structures. My goal is to predict cache utilization and code behavior and to reconfigure the cache dynamically and according to the program requirements. I will evaluate our solutions for single thread and multithreaded processors.

My first long-term goal is to investigate power and performance optimization techniques in the area of chip multiprocessors (CMPs). I will investigate techniques aiming at reducing power dissipation in both interconnect and memory units in CMPs. My second long-term goal is to investigate temperature-aware architectures. As cooling solutions continue to become more expensive finding new solutions to reduce temperature has become a major design concern. In addition higher temperatures increase chip failure rate and impact reliability. Power-aware design alone has failed to address these issues. As a result, temperature-aware design at all system levels, including the microarchitecture has become a necessity. I will investigate solutions to improve temperature by focusing on both localized heating and chip-wide heating.

"Error correction coding is an essential part of any communication system. It allows reliable transmission of information over communication channels such as Internet, wireless, cellular, optical and satellite links. It also allows for reliable retrieval of information from storage devices such as hard drives, CDs and DVDs. To evaluate the error rate performance of a coding scheme, Monte Carlo simulations based on software are often used. For a reliable estimation of error rates, the reach of such simulations however is limited to rather high error rates of about 10^(-7). To reach error rates of order 10^(-10), even with the state-of-the-art computers, would take days. This is while for some applications such as optical communications and storage devices, error rates down to 10^(-15) are required. This is simply out of the reach of software Monte Carlo simulations. In such cases, hardware simulations have to be used.



This proposal is for a hardware prototyping system that will be used to analyze the error rate performance of the state-of-the-art coding schemes, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, at very low error rates. The system will support our on-going research on the design, analysis and implementation of high-performance LDPC codes in applications where low error rates are required. The outcome of this research will give Canada a competitive edge in providing advanced error correction solutions for a variety of applications.

This speed is more than an order of magnitude higher than the current state-of-the-art, and is aimed at very

high-speed applications such as optical networks. The results of this project can also be tailored towards

wireless and mobile applications where speeds of up to 1 Gb/s and very low power are desirable. In daily life,

the outcome of this research would allow service providers to deliver more information over the same optical

fiber with less cost and better quality. This in turn translates to lower cost for broadband communication

services for the consumers. If utilized in a mobile device, in addition to providing better quality of service and

higher speed, the codec devoloped in this project can significantly reduce the consumed energy per information

"Anthracnose caused by the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum truncatum is a major disease of lentil in the Canadian Prairies, control of which is costing lentil producers a significant amount of money through fungicide applications, yield loss and downgrading of seed due to poor quality. Use of cultivars resistant to the two identified races is considered to be the most economical and environmentally safe way of controlling the disease. Long-term success in resistance breeding has been hampered by a lack of knowledge of the pathogenic diversity of the fungus in the field, the potential of the pathogen to adapt to resistant cultivars, and factors that govern virulence in the fungus to specific resistance genes(s) in lentil. Using isolates with known race identity, we will identify molecular markers for virulence and use those to determine the distribution of races in lentil fields. Isolates collected for that purpose will also be used for a molecular population study to determine whether the fungus is outbreeding in nature and thus could develop new races through sexual recombination. With the help of a progeny population from a cross of the two races, we will conduct a genetic study to determine inheritance of virulence in this fungus. A genetic linkage map for Colletrotrichum truncatum will be developed. We also intend to investigate the infection biology of the two races on susceptible and resistant lentil genotypes by microscopy and with molecular tools to identify critical points in the interaction, and to determine virulence mechanisms in the pathogen. In doing so we will develop a cDNA library from infected lentil leaves that will allow us to identify genes involved in virulence in the pathogen, and in future those involved in resistance. Potential function of targeted genes will be confirmed by gene-disrupted mutants. The results of this project will allow the industry partner, together with plant breeders and pathologists, to develop a long-term strategy for the development of durable resistance to anthracnose, and to monitor the pathogen in an efficient way in future using technology and research tools developed in this project.","Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",4,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan

"The goal of the proposed research program is to study the relation between a particular method in the area of Evolutionary Computation, namely Genetic Programming (GP) , and the field of Self-Organization. The need for such a study comes from the realization that GP in its traditional form has reached a plateau of development. The technique is presently being exploited in many fields of Science and Engineering, yet its limitations become clearer every day. One key obstacle for GP is the problem of scalability, i.e. the difficulty to evolve large programs using present-day representations of programs. Another difficulty is the interaction of various non-intended, emergent phenomena of evolutionary runs with the primary goal of the artificial evolution.



We aim at studying the relationship between GP and self-organization by introducing various innovative representations of programs (together with corresponding operators producing new variants of programs). Some will be non-sequential (like in our recent work on random sequences), some will be self-evolving representations, some will be otherwise complex. A representation with considerable promise is one consisting of a genome with regulatory elements (like regulatory networks in nature). Other representations will have elements of development added.



The research proposed here will contribute to a vibrant research field of Computer Science, including Evolutionary Computation. In applications, the areas of Bioinformatics  and Computational Finance hold many problems that are suitable for exploitation with Genetic Programming, with substantial benefits to Canada.

"This proposal aims to acquire an optical detection system for establishing the first sound velocity meter with ultrahigh spatial resolution in waveguide structures. This includes a) 40Gs/s high-speed digitizers (only in market a few months ago) to record the location of the acoustic wave and b) a high power tunable laser providing the energy to the acoustic wave at a measurable distance. By optically measuring the sound velocity on different modes of the waveguide materials, we can calculate the refractive index via the Brillouin frequency shift and dispersion at different wavelengths.  

 Because of the mode structural information is associated with acoustic modes and birefringence properties, the requested optical detection system will have a pivotal impact on 1) designing the high threshold stimulated Billouin scattering (SBS) fiber to reduce nonlinear effects; 2) dispersion measurement and 3) designing the low birefringence fiber to reduce the polarization mode dispersion (PMD) and polarization dependent loss (PDL). These three outcomes are the limiting factors for high speed fiber communication systems. In addition, the distributed sound velocity and birefringence information provides material characterization leading to high quality composite materials for aerospace industry; to fuel cell monitoring, and to non-destructive detection of the health conditions of civil and aerospace structures. Optical fiber sound velocity meter can also be used as pulse squeezer, trapping the pulse as delay element for optical signal processing. The new system will enhance international collaboration with Europe, Japan and US through HQP exchange and will improve training in two of the directions of my research program.

"The research program described in this application covers two main directions. 

(1) The threats of the terrorism, climate change, pollution, and communications are an increasing concern for both government and citizens. The distributed fibre sensor is idea candidate for addressing this kind of problems due to its large area coverage ability, and combining multi-parameters for sensing. Through the research performed so far, the applicant has been successful in developing distributed temperature and strain sensors for health monitoring of civil structures, and use this sensor for crack and deformation of bridges, pipes. This program relies on a deep understanding of nonlinear effects in fibers and civil structural mechanism to predict the potential problems. The applicant intends to build upon the previous successful work and, furthermore, to add the chemical and biomedical functions into the sensing system through micro-spheres and micro-rings. The new combined static and dynamic sensor for strain and impact waves, as well as chemical detection will better meet the needs for public safety and security protection. The impact of this research will lead to prevention of potential problems to our buildings, bridges, energy supply chains, and pipelines. It will also contribute to address the country's environmental challenges. 

(2) With the new trends of multimedia, for education and entertainment, and Internet, as communication tool, more bandwidth is required on fibers. This means channels are needed at high speed communications, which pushes for high costs. The applicant proposes developing a compact mode locked fiber laser source based on the ""Kerr Lens"", and then using micro-structural fibers and nonlinear effects in fibers to make super-continuum source with the new novel source. This single source can replace many conventional sources to make a cost effective communication system.  The new knowledge generated from this program and the training of highly qualified personnel will have a strong scientific impact. It will stimulate the development and applications relevant to Canada high-technology sectors.

"This projects aims to improve the technology for surveillance, early detection and identification of disastrous events so that measures can be taken to reduce or eliminate dangerous consequences. This objective will be addressed by developing the first distributed Brillouin sensor for vibration wave, acoustic wave and strain detection in large infrastructures such as airports, bridges, buildings, railways, power lines and water/energy pipelines. Acoustic wave and vibration detection are important to provide the internal condition of civil structures, such as cracks, defects and corrosion. Strain detection can contribute to ice load monitoring. It can also be an elegant and invisible way to monitorany unauthorized entry into a restricted area by a person or a vehicle.  The traditional vibration and acoustic wave sensors are point sensors. In order to cover an entire bridge structure or an airport security area, many sensors, wires and display units are needed which makes monitoring

system complicated and expensive. The demand for reliable, easy to install, accurate and cost effective sensors is obvious.

The specific objectives of the project are: 1. To develop the distributed static strain and acoustic wave sensing for ice load and sudden current change of power lines; 2. To develop the distributed dynamic and static strain sensor for structural damage monitoring and intrusion sensing. The dynamic sensing through acoustic and vibration wave detection will provide a good standard for structures monitoring in terms of public safety, comfort and convenience. This is very important to protect and prolong the useful life of structures, to prevent potential disaster and to estimate rehabilitation and maintenance needs.","Ressources d'�nergie (production, exploration, traitement, distribution et utilisation de l'�nergie)","Ressources d'�nergie","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Safety and Security",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario

"My NSERC-supported research program concerns the metabolism of protein and amino acids, and protein and amino acid nutrition. Amino acids are a complex set of nutrients, of which many (the essential amino acids) cannot be formed in the body. These amino acids must be provided from a dietary source, although protein reserves within the body act as a limited term resource when dietary supplies are limiting.



Ongoing research in my laboratory concerns how amino acids are used by the body, how they are stored and released again in times of need, and what forms of amino acid nutrition are optimal during different stress states, that affect many species of animals and humans. Two stress states typified by high demand for amino acids, lactation and inflammation, will be studied.

"Reactions involving the catalytic conversion of nitrogen oxide (NOx), hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide are of major environmental importance for the removal of toxic emissions from both stationary and automotive sources. Toxic compounds can be converted to harmless non-pollutants using heterogeneous catalysis. The reduction of nitrogen oxides by light hydrocarbons in the presence of excess of oxygen, typical of the exhaust of lean-burn and Diesel engines, presents a great technological challenge. Conventional catalysts show several disadvantages, such as high cost, short life time, and fail to control their activity during the catalytic process. The recently discovered phenomenon of Electrochemical Promotion of Catalysis (EPOC) combined with classical heterogeneous catalysis could be applied in order to overcome some of the above mentioned problems. The controlled variation in the catalyst-electrode potential of metal or metal oxide films supported on solid electrolytes is responsible for considerable changes in catalytic activity and selectivity. It has been demonstrated that electrochemical promotion is not limited to any particular electrolyte, conductive catalyst, or type of reaction. The major obstacles towards commercialization of EPOC are the lack of efficient catalysts and reactor design. The objective of the proposed research program is to develop efficient system devices for the removal of the toxic pollutants (NOx, hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, etc.) from Diesel and lean-burn automobile exhausts using electrochemical promotion. The overall goal in the short to medium term is to design nano-structured catalysts of defined size and structure, and their application to NOx reduction. The long term objective is to establish a comprehensive understanding of the electrochemical promotion with nano-structured catalysts. The significant output of this interdisciplinary research will answer many fundamental questions in heterogeneous catalysis and lead to a new stage of nano-sized catalytic systems for air pollution prevention.

"Canada has traditionally been at the forefront of the metals industry in supplying technology and value-added products. It ranks third in production of aluminum and nickel and is a major producer of other metals such as copper and steel. In most of the metal production and refining processes, gas injection into liquid baths at high temperature is a common practice. The intention of this operation is to thermally/chemically homogenize the bath and/or introduce reactive gasses into the liquid for refining of the melt. Understanding the intensity of the mixing of the liquid bath is of crucial importance in increasing productivity, reducing production costs, and lowering environmental emissions. However, because of the hostile environment in the metallurgical furnaces, it is extremely difficult to obtain information on details of the process in the actual operation. Instead, laboratory scale simulation of the process at low temperature has frequently been employed to understand the behavior of the actual systems.

The scientific objectives of this project are to study, in bottom blown gas stirred metallurgical baths, effects of presence of a thick slag layer two phenomena: (a) mixing in the lower liquid and (b) emulsiflcation and interfacial area increase between slag and metal. In both studies, low temperature liquids (e.g. aqueous and organic) will be used to simulate behaviors of the systems of the interest.

The project will provide an excellent opportunity for training of highly qualified personnel who have a good foundation of knowledge and technical expertise for chemical and metallurgical industries. The other long term benefit of the project is increasing the knowledge pool within the Canadian industry and academia in this critical area which will further enhance the Canada's global position in the metals industry.

"Canadian mining and metals industry makes a significant contribution to the nation's economical growth. Also, the industry holds a high global position in the production of a variety of metals and metallic products. Majority of metals and alloys are produced through pyrometallurgical routes, which bring the metal to liquid state by consuming substantial amounts of energy.  The non-metallic parts of the raw materials are generally accumulated in a layer, known as slag, on the top surface of the metal bath. Quantity and properties of the slag phase significantly influence the quality of the metal/alloy and the efficiency parameters of the process such as energy consumption, productivity, and the production cost. 

Slag foaming is an important phenomenon that is intentionally induced or inherently occurs in many metallurgical processes such as electric steelmaking, direct smelting of iron ores, and slag cleaning stage of copper making. The foaming is essentially expansion of liquid slag by gas bubbles that are generated either though a reaction or gases externally injected into the slag.  In most cases, the reaction responsible for gas generation is the reduction of iron oxide by carbon (dissolved in liquid metal or solid form) and generation of carbon monoxide. Considerable attention has been paid to foaming properties of metallurgical slags due to importance of this phenomenon in energy efficiency of process, metals recovery from slag, and its effect on extending refectory life. For improved control and optimization of the foaming in pyrometallurgical operations, a model of the process will be very beneficial. Development of such model that is essentially capable of predicting foam conditions (height, gas fraction) as a function of the process parameters is the main scientific goal of the proposed research. Another objective of the project is training highly qualified personnel in the area of process metallurgy, and  

The model will be developed first by theoretical treatment of gas generation and foam evolution. The theoretical model will then be tested and verified against experimental data and/or industrial data. Such model would be extremely beneficial in optimizing slag foaming operations in both ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical operations. Optimization of these processes in turn translates into direct economical and environmental benefits for the related Canadian industries. In addition, several highly qualified personnel will be trained in the course of this project that are well qualified to take key positions as process engineers or scientists within the Canadian industry and the academia.

"The human genome harbours sequences, which originate from viruses known as retroviruses. It has been estimated that about 8% of human DNA is composed of these retroviral sequences. These sequences have been integrated in the genome of primates 25 million years ago. Although most of these DNA regions are no longer capable of producing viruses, some have been reported to have retained the capacity to generate viruses, which, although non-infectious, can be observed in the extracellular milieu. These viruses are termed Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERV). The presence of HERVs in the human organism has been rarely associated with biological phenomena, although tentative links have been suggested between their presence and various forms of cancers, arthritis, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. Interestingly, proteins derived from HERV-related genes, termed syncytin 1, syncytin 2 and envP(b) representing the envelope proteins of ancient retroviruses could be important for the development of the placenta. Based on our preliminary results, we are interested in testing their involvement in placenta development through the study of the expression of their respective genes in trophoblast cells (placenta-derived cells), their localisation inside the cell and by analysing their impact on cell fusion steps occurring during placenta formation by the use of specific inhibitors. Several tools (including cell fusion assays, specific antibodies and RNA interference-based RNA molecules) will be herein generated or optimized and then used in this study to understand the implication of these retrovirus-related proteins on cell fusion. These results will bring a new light on how these HERV genes are turned on in trophoblast cells and how they affect the important biological processes occurring during the development of the placenta. This research project should also permit to reach a better understanding of disorders related to pregnancy and anomalies in the placenta development such as preeclampsia.  As a more long term objective, we plan to look at the role played by HERV genes in other normal biological processes or in diseases such as multiple sclerosis and cancer.

"This project is about high speed wireless networks, such as the WiMax/802.16 mesh networks. They are of growing importance for emergency communications, Internet wireless access, and wireless voice over IP. They are growing in scale and complexity to a stage where management automation is required. Because they feature ad hoc mechanisms, network management needs to be distributed and result from the cooperation of the participating nodes, in contrast to an infrastructure type of network management predominated by the manager-managed node relationship. The manager function is a feature present in every participating node.

In this research, the focus is on network security management and network topology management. Our work on security is guided by the analysis of threats. We don't aim at absolute security, which is in a utopia and extremely costly to come close. We look instead at the possible attacks. They are prioritized according to an evaluation of their risk. The level of risk is determined by looking at the factors of potential attacker motivation, level of difficulty, and eventual impact. For instance, in practice a good number of critical risk threats tend to be related with rogue devices. To approach this problem, we dig into wireless network protocol and system descriptions to find data sources that can used to detect anomalies. Geometric and statistical techniques are used to create anomaly detection tests. The effectiveness of the tests is measured in simulation and real network settings.

Our work on network topology management is rooted in the area of distributed algorithms for the resolution of graph problems. Such algorithms do address aspects such as cluster formation or dominating node selection. Because of their distributed character, these algorithms potentially address practical ad hoc network topology management issues, such as sponsor node selection in WiMax/802.16. We refine distributed algorithm specifications into protocol descriptions and conducting actual evaluations on simulated and real networks. The performance is evaluated using metrics that are meaningful to network managers.","Syst�mes et services de communications (planification, organisation et services)","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computing and Information Sciences - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"Our proposed research falls within the scope of understanding factors augmenting or limiting healthy ecosystems. The Bay of Fundy is a very productive and dynamic ecosystem that is economically important.  Strong tidal currents in the bay erode surrounding cliffs of soft siltstone and shale, leading to the establishment of extensive mudflats in the upper bay. These mudflats are rich habitats, densely inhabited by an amphipod, Corophium volutator (hereafter Corophium). These amphipods appear to consolidate sediments by their burrow-building activities and so stabilize the mudflats. Also, they are rich in fatty acids and are a major food of fish and migratory shorebirds. Given its worth and uniqueness, the upper Bay of Fundy has been designated part of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network, as well as a biosphere reserve in UNESCO's Man

and the Biosphere network. Our proposed research is timely in that planned short-term changes in use of tidal barrier causeways located near the mudflats and longer-term changes brought about by global warming will likely affect water flows and sedimentation rates, and increase temperatures and sea levels. Any natural or anthropogenic factors that threaten the health of Corophium populations also threaten the productivity of the coastal regions in which they reside, and biodiversity found therein. We will model the interactions between Corophium and other species (parasites, competitors, predators) and abiotic processes (sedimentation rates, temperature changes). We are interested in how such interactions observed today will be affected by global climate change and regional management decisions concerning the fate of causeways. We will assess

connectivity between Corophium populations in the upper bay, whether demographic rescue is possible when/if local Corophium populations crash, and the extent to which dietary needs of migratory shorebirds may be affected by changing Corophium populations. We will also identify productive sites that would become the focus of conservation activities by federal, provincial or non-profit agencies (Environment Canada, Nova Scotia Dept. Natural Resources, New Brunswick Dept. Natural Resources, Nature Conservancy of Canada).",Environnement,"D�veloppement du nord","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","New Brunswick",Nouveau-Brunswick

"Many avian species are socially monogamous; a female pairs and raises a brood with a male, yet may have young that are not sired by the resident male. These extra-pair young result from fertilizations obtained by females outside the pair bond. In socially monogamous passerines, extra-pair fertilizations are typically not forced by males, but are due to females seeking them out. Obtaining good genes for the offspring is one of several possibilities why females mate outside the pair bond. The good genes hypothesis predicts that some males are of higher quality than others; females paired to high-quality males would remain genetically monogamous, while females paired to lower-quality males would obtain extra-pair fertilizations from higher quality males, resulting in large variances in male reproductive success. Females would need to assess males by one or more variable cues that are condition-dependent such that males advertise their quality honestly. Recent reviews have shown plumage colouration to be important in mate attraction and/or male-male competition. Both American robins and European starlings have extra-pair young in their broods. The objectives of the studies I am proposing are to determine in American robins and European starlings: 1) the role of plumage/bill colouration, body size, condition, and blood parasite loads in relation to mate choice, 2) whether assortative mating with respect to plumage colouration exists, 3) whether the good parent hypothesis (a positive relationship exists between ornamental expression and level of parental care) or the differential allocation hypothesis (a negative relationship exists between these two variables), holds true for nestling provisioning by adults, 4) the role of song in social and genetic mate choice by females, and 5) paternity and offspring sex ratios between first and second broods. This research is important because it is novel; none of these components have been examined together in each of these species. Publication of this research will make valuable contributions to the areas of avian mate choice, sexual selection, and parental investment. The proposed studies are also beneficial to Canadians in providing us with insights into the natural world.

"The Web has become a vast, dynamic repository of information about virtually every topic, including people, their opinions, and their connections to one another. Recent developments in Web technology have led to easier ways with which users can produce, annotate, and consume data. Managing all this data, and in such a heterogeneous environment, is a daunting task and a major challenge embraced by many, in several areas of computer science, including databases. In this proposal, we are interested in data management problems that arise in the context of the Web as well as in exploiting the latent knowledge in the Web for solving traditional data management problems. 



More specifically, we are interested in the efficient management of XML data, which are the preferred format for representing and exchanging data on the Web, as well as the underlying foundation of Web services and the Semantic Web. We propose to continue our work on efficient XML management, as well as to address the need for notions of Information Theory that are suited for XML content. We are also interested in exploiting Semantic Web documents, particularly ontologies, for helping in solving data exchange and integration problems. In particular, we are interested in exploiting domain knowledge to build wrappers for deep Web sites, which contain valuable information not accessible through search engines. Moreover, we intend to exploit domain knowledge to help in the understanding mappings between schemas, and for evaluating their quality. We are interested in developing distributed search algorithms that exploit both the structure and the content of nodes in a network for efficiently routing queries in the system.



Our goal is to develop algorithms, tools and systems based on solid theoretical foundations, while providing opportunities for the training of HQP at the University of Calgary.","Technologie de l'information, des ordinateurs et des r�seaux de communications","Avancement des connaissances","Computing and Information Sciences - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"As part of my research program on the implications of flight on the behavioural and physiological ecology and life histories of bats, I will conduct several projects in the Yukon. The unique northern environments will allow me to test predictions regarding the evolution and diversity of life histories, how nocturnal animals deal with no night, and the potential impacts of climate change on northern ecosystems. For example, the northern limit of bats may be determined by environmental conditions such as temperature. Climate change may allow populations to expand northward, but if the short nights at high latitudes preclude individuals from feeding for long enough to obtain energy for reproduction, their northward expansion may be limited. We will determine how bats in the Yukon adjust their feeding behaviour to cool temperatures and short nights. We will also determine how they select roosts so as to minimize the costs of staying warm in a cold environment, and how the combination of feeding and roosting behaviours influence growth and reproduction. A second area of research in the Yukon will examine the effects of spruce beetle infestations on bat feeding behaviour and small mammal populations. Spruce beetles have caused extensive changes to forests and we will determine how those changes compare to those caused by other disturbances, both natural (fire) and man-made (logging).

"Studies of people with memory impairments (from Alzheimer's disease, dementia, stroke, viral infection, alcohol abuse, or normal aging) have shown that a specific set of brain structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is vital for memory function.  The textbook account of memory function is that the MTL is made up of several structures that work together as a single ""module"" to support our conscious memory.  This module is thought to be independent of other brain functions.  However, recent research suggests that there may be a division of labour between the different structures in the MTL, and that these structures may play a role in perception as well as memory.  The proposed research seeks to develop a new theoretical framework for understanding human amnesia and the organization of memory in the healthy brain.  This research aims to demonstrate that the current approach of assigning psychological labels, such as ""short term memory"" ""long term memory"" or ""perception"", to individual brain regions is misguided, as these neatly segregated parcels of cognitive function do not map onto discrete cortical areas in the brain.

"The NASA/JPL Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) have shown the benefit of providing exploration robots with a degree of self-governance, or autonomy, to overcome limited communications. As a result of using these ground-breaking tools, humankind has learned more about the geology, mineralogy, and meteorology of Mars in the last three years than in all of previous history. A key building block to enable robotic autonomy is the ability to self-localize, or determine position and orientation using on-board sensors.

From an engineering perspective, localization is necessary to keep a rover on course. From a scientific perspective, it is important to know where data have been collected. This project will create core localization methods for planetary rovers and test them through rigorous field trials. This preparation will pave the way for the use of these critical techniques on a future Canadian surface exploration mission.","A�rospatial","Services et syst�mes de transport","Mechanical Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Who would not want to know the basic constituents of our world and the way they interact? Nuclear and particle physics studies exactly that. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, there are six types of quarks, six types of leptons, and corresponding anti-particles connected by four interactions.  For decades it was believed that a lepton called a neutrino should have neither charge nor mass.  However, new measurements from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, a world-class Canadian facility, have clearly shown that solar neutrinos change their type in transit to the Earth, which can only be explained by small mass. Does this mean that the Standard Model of Particle Physics is incorrect, or just an approximation of a larger, more global model? The neutrinos are being detected via weak interaction. That alone would make weak interaction worth studying more closely. In addition, it violates parity! We can conduct experiments of parity-violating electron-nucleon scattering to study the distribution and dynamics of ""strange"" quarks in the nucleon, using ""strange"" quark as a key to the overall understanding of quark-antiquark sea properties.

     My role is to provide theoretical input for these experiments by calculating corresponding radiative corrections. Few people are working in this area, even though high-precision electroweak radiative corrections are crucial for nucleon parameters extraction from the measured asymmetry of electron-nucleon scattering cross sections. The research project I am proposing can be a crucial contribution to cutting-edge Canadian science in the coming decade, and it would also allow me to train a new generation of researchers who would enable Canada to maintain its position at the very forefront of world-class research for years to come. 

     It is never clear where the next major breakthrough in theoretical physics might come from. I have strong reasons to believe that the fundamental mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking, neutrino physics and strangeness content of the nucleon could be just such an area.

"Considerable debate discusses the interactions of sea lice and wild and farmed salmon in British Columbia. Within this debate, the role of ectoparasitic sea lice in disease propagation (as a vector) or progression (impacts on the host's immunology) has not been described. Many models examine vector-pathogen relationships (e.g., pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks). However, these models focus on humans or agriculture animals and none exist for a marine ecosystem using fish. Few reports have isolated viral and bacterial pathogens from sea lice, but pathogen transmission has never been tested; thus, the role of sea lice as a vector remains undefined. In other words, when (seasonally) and where (geographically), could sea lice carry important pathogens of salmon? Such information is critical to the salmon farming industry. In a pilot study in British Columbia, Canada, we repeatedly isolated three pathogenic bacterial species from sea lice and their farmed

Atlantic salmon hosts. Such results partly support the vector hypothesis but certainly warrant a comprehensive, long-term study. Thus, the proposed research will be conducted in two phases: (1.) we will experimentally test the vector transmission potential of sea lice in a controlled setting to examine their role in disease propagation. (2a.) If transmission occurs, we will analyse seasonal and geographic patterns in pathogen abundance on sea lice from farmed and wild salmonids within an ecological context. Ultimately, we hope to use sea lice as a sentinel species to indicate the presence of pathogens and thereby identify high risk zones. (2b.) If there is no transmission, we will study the effect of sea lice feeding at the microhabitat of the fish's skin. In these experiments, we will test the hypothesis that the feeding activities of lice promote small, localised patches of reduced immune response, thus serving as portals of pathogen entry and replication. This research is topical,

yet novel, in that it presents a unique opportunity to study the direct and indirect contribution to disease progression by a commercially important parasite of salmon. It is anticipated that our results will directly assist salmon farmers in the development of effective disease prevention strategies at netpens.",Aquiculture,"Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Fishery Industry","2 & 3","STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"A Privacy Preserving Database Management System (DBMS) provides the core functions expected of any DBMS while guaranteeing data provided by a supplier is only used for its intended purpose. This research will develop a DBMS that includes privacy as a core feature rather than as an ""add-on"" to an existing non-privacy aware DBMS. The goal is to develop a system where data providers supply information with explicit privacy requirements, possibly different requirements for different kinds of data, while the DBMS itself can collect the data at any level but only use it in concordance with the privacy specified by the provider. Thus, the data provider's privacy is preserved by the DBMS.



Once the privacy model is developed and demonstrated to be correct and complete, the approach is to take an existing DBMS, probably open source, and add these privacy features by wrapping an existing DBMS with them. This will not require changes to the DBMS engine itself and will provide insights into how to add privacy retroactively to legacy systems. Based on the lessons learned from this extension, the model will be incorporated directly into an open source DBMS engine to create a privacy-preserving one that is native in that all features are implemented within the engine itself. Thus, the native PP-DBMS will incorporate the privacy model in all components of a DBMS engine including the user interface, query processor, and transaction manager. This will ultimately lead to a system that can provide stronger security and provide users with increased privacy protection. 



The work will be undertaken in collaboration with several other academic researchers and industrial partners will be sought to develop commericialization possibilities.

"Galaxies are the largest luminous objects in the universe, and understanding how galaxies (including our own) came to be the way they are is a major focus of modern astronomy. Questions we want to answer include the following: how did galaxies assemble their stars and gas? How did they assume their present shapes? What controls the rate at which they form new stars? The lifetime of a galaxy is very long compared to a human lifetime, so astronomers need to reconstruct the past from observations of the present, somewhat like archaeologists.



The intent of this research is to study the star-forming process in detail within several nearby galaxies. A major advantage to studying these galaxies is that we can see fine details, but also see the ""big picture"", which is difficult in our own Milky Way. We will work towards understanding the physical conditions that lead to star formation today, and determining how stars, particularly those within star clusters, formed in the past. This will enable the construction of star formation histories which can be compared to computer simulations of the galaxy formation process.



This is a golden age in astronomy. New observational facilities and more sophisticated computer simulations allow the exploration of our fascinating universe in greater detail. Understanding how galaxies formed is an important part of knowing where we came from.

Cette transition est possible avec des biotechnologies et des bioproduits capables de biotransformer des biomasses foresti�res, fra�ches ou r�siduelles, en bio�nergie, biocarburants et autres produits. Id�alement, l'obtention des produits devrait se faire sur place � partir de r�sidus papetiers comme les boues issues du traitement des eaux us�es.

Neither is it due to the difficulty in figuring out that 9,465,438 is 2x3x1,577,573. The true reason is that the whole numbers are surprisingly deep, and the study of whole numbers, also known as ""number theory"", forced us to better understand, and indeed develop, many other useful and beautiful techniques, concepts and ideas.

"OBJECTIVE: My discovery grant will concentrate on understanding the processes leading to the formation of magmatic platinum-group element (PGE) and nickel (Ni) deposits.  In particular I would like to consider the processes leading to the formation of the phases hosting these elements.   

METHODOLOGY:  The following projects are proposed: 

a) The classical model suggests that these elements are collected from mafic magma by a base metal sulphide (BMS) liquid and that saturation of the magma in BMS liquid is brought about by contamination with a sulphur-bearing sediment.  We would like to look for evidence of the sediments by looking at trace elements in BMS. b) Saturation of mafic magmas with an Fe-sulphide liquid has been investigated, but whether Ni and Cu concentrations in mafic magmas affect how much sulphur is required to saturate a magma has not.  We would like to carry out experiments to investigate this.  c) Some workers propose that in PGE-deposits BMS is not the main collector of PGE and that PGE were collected or redistributed by late magmatic or metamorphic processes.  We wish to investigate this idea by determining which minerals host PGE in Ni- and PGE- deposits and what the textural relationships of these minerals are in deposits that have undergone different degrees of metamorphism and high temperature alteration. d) Investigate the influence of metamorphism and high temperature alteration using S/Se ratios  e)  Some models suggest that magma mixing is important in the formation of PGE deposits.  We will look for evidence of magma mixing by considering the trace element contents of silicate minerals associated with the deposits.

INNOVATION: These projects will apply the newly developed LA-ICP-MS and micro petrographic techniques that have to date been largely reserved for fundamental research to the realm of ore-deposit formation.

"The long-term objective of our research program is to understand the molecular basis of the interactions between alpha-proteobacteria and eukaryotic cells. This group of bacteria comprises animal and human pathogens (Bartonella, Brucella, Ochrobactrum), plant pathogens (Agrobacterium) and plant symbionts (Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium) as well as free-living bacteria. The genomic sequences of many alpha-proteobacteria became available in recent years. Based on this wealth of information, post-genomic studies are now possible that are aimed at understanding the different survival strategies of this group of bacteria. We have chosen the genus Ochrobactrum for our research program as its different species reflect a broad spectrum of life styles from free-living soil bacteria to plant symbionts and opportunistic human pathogens. The principal model for our work during the next funding period will be the opportunistic pathogen Ochrobactrum anthropi. This organism lives in soil, but the number of reports on its isolation from immuno-suppressed patients in hospitals has been increasing, suggesting that it has significant pathogenic potential. As the pathogenicity for humans is modest, O. anthropi can be studied under biosafety level 2 conditions, which is an important pre-requisite for our long-term research plans. In the next funding period, we will characterize the intracellular trafficking of O. anthropi and the regulation of its virulence genes. This work will set the stage for a comprehensive systems approach, which will use fusions to genes regulated during intracellular growth to characterize the metabolic responses of the pathogen. In the context of our long-term research program we will extend our research to plant symbiotic and free-living members of the genus Ochrobactrum. This analysis will provide fascinating novel insights into the different survival strategies that enable closely related bacteria to live in very different environments.

"The objectives of this proposal are to contribute to the knowledge on effectively and efficiently manage the service industry and to improve the practices in the management of these operations.  I inspire to provide insight that is relevant to the operations considered and their managers.  

For this, I will combine a theoretical and a practical component.  On the theoretical side I will pursue three areas: queueing models and their applications (focusing on call centers staffing), facility location, and inventory-control-and-pricing.  This last area, which involves demand management, is related to the practical research component: capacity allocation and demand management (CADM) problems. 

CADM problems are faced by many businesses that face variable demand.  Three examples are: (i) A Movies Rental Chain needs to allocate a number of copies from a new movie among its stores to satisfy as much demand as possible within the first weeks following the movie's release.  (ii) A Concrete Supplying Company needs to allocate demand among its limited trucks in the high building season (i.e., light hours of the spring and summer time).  (iii) Some Wholesalers receive bonuses from suppliers for achieving sales above a pre-specified quota during a period.  Thus, near the end of the period such wholesalers aspire to allocate their sales force to different items and clients in order to maximize profit.

I see my research as a viable extension to the current literature and practice in these research areas.  These extensions can improve the solutions to these problems and, in the long run, allow businesses to improve their decision processes via the use of quantitative methods.  Moreover, I believe that finding applicable solutions to CADM problems in different Canadian industries is an important mean to apply university research in businesses.  I hope that the combination of the theoretical and practical parts of my work would improve resources usage and profitability and achieve the objectives of this proposal.","Production et gestion des op�rations","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Industrial Engineering",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"There is currently no effective treatment available to managing vertebral compression fractures (VCF), which are the most common complication of osteoporosis. Since the incidence is expected to continue escalating as the population ages, it is essential to find a solution.

Vertebroplasty (VP) is a minimally invasive procedure to treat VCF. In it, medical cement is injected into the vertebral porous structure to augment the bone weakened by osteoporosis. The main benefit is that patients experience pain relief almost immediately after the procedure at a fraction of the cost of other treatments. Some of the principal challenges in inhibiting the widespread use of VP is cement extravasation and embolism due to leakage where the cement leaks out of the vertebra and into surrounding tissue and can lead to serious complications such as nerve damage, pulmonary embolism and even death.

The objective of this application is to develop a research program for safe VP instrumentation, whose aim is to assist physicians in exerting more control on the procedure for the patient's safety. 

Both computational and experimental methods will be combined to enhance the quality of the research program and develop safe instrumentation. The interdisciplinary nature of this research provides a unique opportunity highly qualified personnel.

The expected outcomes are guidelines and devices to control the cement filling and to apply it in a more consistent and predictable manner. The prime beneficiaries are Canadian patients suffering from VCF. The wider socio-economic impacts of these developments are potential health care savings and commercial exploitation of devices by the medical industry.

"The basic protein units that form the permeable channels on the cell surface are called connexins. The opening of connexin channels allow for biological particles to circulate between the interior and the exterior of a cell or between the interiors of two attached cells. In the present study, we are interested in a specific variant of connexins called connexin43 (Cx43). The gating (opening and closing) of Cx43 channels can be regulated. Like many other channels on the cell surface, the primary mean of regulation is achieved by phosphorylation of the channel units.  An enzyme, called protein kinase C (PKC), mediates the phosphorylation of Cx43. It acts at precise sites on the Cx43 unit and induces the closure of Cx43-formed channels. There are, at least, twelve identified isoforms of PKC so far. However, the characterization of the functional role of these various isoforms in the regulation of Cx43 channels has largely been limited by the lack of isoform-selective activators and inhibitors. Here, we use a matrix of newly developed PKC isoforms-selective activator and inhibitor peptides, in combination of the state-of-the-art patch clamp technique, to study the effect that various PKC isoforms exert in the regulation of Cx43 channels. This will be achieved by measuring electrical currents recorded from cells expressing Cx43 channels in the presence of various peptides. We will also use molecular biology techniques to eliminate potential phosphorylation sites on Cx43 in order to evaluate their involvement in the regulation of Cx43 channels by PKC. Finally, we will synthesize small protein fragments that mimic the phosphorylation sites on Cx43 and investigate their effects on Cx43 channel properties following activation of PKC.

"In the central nervous system, brain cells (neurons) communicate with each other by means of release of chemical neurotransmitters. This occurs mainly at specialized parts of the neuron, known as ""synapses"". The process of  neurotransmission requires a unique set of molecules on either side of the synapse; one of the three core proteins needed for release of neurotransmitter is SNAP-25. The molecular mechanism that enables SNAP-25 to regulate neurotransmission is well described in cell culture work, but the functional significance of the protein in intact organisms is not well understood. The current research project will examine how SNAP-25 plays a role in the physiology of monoamine neurons in the rat brain. The monoamine neurons include the serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic projections to the forebrain. This class of neurons is essential for most forms of preconscious and conscious attentional processing. In the first phase of the project, we will use microscopy and specialized lesion techniques to confirm that SNAP-25 is present in the

presynaptic regions of monoamine neurons: this will be undertaken in brain regions where monoamines play a critical role in modifying attention. We will then use a selective neurotoxin for SNAP-25 and mRNA modifying techniques to decrease levels of the protein. The effects of reduced levels of SNAP-25 will be determined with regards to release of monoamine neurotransmitters and monoamine-dependent mediated attentional processing. This research will provide critical insight into the functional relevance of SNAP-25 to many of the most basic forms of mammalian behavior.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"This strategic research project funded by NSERC is a collaborative effort between one of Canada's top

Universities - McGill and a leading Canadian internal fixation device manufacturer - Terray Corporation.

It has been known for a century that magnesium and its biological corrosion products are non toxic, enhance

bone formation and support osteoblast differentiation and function, yet no commercial product based on this

well established technology exist. The reason for this is that the previous aim was to create degradable load

bearing bone fixation plates which was highly ambitious and fraught with difficulties stemming from a lack of

knowledge concerning the inorganic phosphate degradation products and biological responses to these

materials (about which the PI specialises). Our aim is to build on the wealth of knowledge accumulated in

these prior studies to develop new osteoconductive coatings for bone fixation plates, matrices for delivery of

therapeutic molecules from these coatings and to examine more systematically the role that these phosphate

corrosion products have in controlling the rate of biological degradation of magnesium based devices.

This research will help to maintain Terray's position as a global leader in biomedical engineering innovation.

Improved fracture fixation and reduced patient recovery times are the main anticipated benefits of this research.","Appareils et instruments m�dicaux","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Biomedical Technologies",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"The ability of an animal host to mount effective immune responses requires the exquisite cross-regulation of innate and adaptive arms of immunity. Deviation from the seamless integration of these responses forms the basis for autoimmune diseases and has serious implications for the susceptibility of the host to pathogenic microorganisms. The current dogma states that evolutionary pressures led to the development of the adaptive arm of the immune response, which had to carefully overlay onto already well-established innate mechanisms of immunity. Our long-term goal is to understand how these bridges were formed. 

        My research program will use a combined molecular and cell biology approach, employing animal models and cell culture techniques to achieve this goal. Because FcR (antibody-mediated) phagocytosis is known to regulate antimicrobial responses at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity, we will characterize the biology of this system in a lower vertebrate model. This will give us an excellent vantage point to examine the early formation of these bridges, at a critical time in evolution where primordial mechanisms of innate immunity gained additional adaptive tools to defend against incoming pathogens. We have recently shown that teleost fish have functional FcR phagocytosis. However, it is unclear if this internalization process leads to the activation of the complex array of downstream responses that is characteristic of mammals. Therefore, the specific aims of this project are: 1) to dissect the FcR phagocytosis signaling mechanisms of bony fish macrophages; 2) to examine the cross-talk between teleost FcR phagocytosis, parallel innate mechanisms of immunity, and downstream adaptive responses; and 3) to compare FcR phagocytic responses in classical monocyte-derived macrophages and a novel macrophage population that we originally identified and characterized in teleost fish, which appears to represent one of the earliest evolutionary derivatives of the macrophage lineage. The availability of unique reagents in our laboratory coupled to our expertise in every technique that we propose to use will ensure the timely success of this research.

"Cell interactions on surfaces have attracted much recent attention from many materials chemists and physicists, since powerful tools are now available to probe these delicate structures in their native environment at the smallest scales, and many questions can now be framed in chemical terms.  Understanding the surface conditions that permit cells to live and function, then permits biomedical engineering advances in regenerative medicine, and tissue repair and replacement.  In addition to the chemistry of molecular groups exposed on a surface to a cell, growing cells are also very sensitive to the softness of the surface material, the thickness, the water content, - or + charge, and ion concentrations and gradients.   In general, the more 'biological' the artificial surface can be made to appear (wet, soft, charged, warm, and rich in ions and specific functional groups), the more biocompatible it will be with respect to cell adhesion, survival, and function.  In order to control the biological interface then, one needs to be able both to measure all of these properties in situ in a true biological environment, and to have the power to manipulate and tune these properties over a wide range with simple preparation protocols.



The goals of this research proposal lie in the development of new bio-mimetic materials that can be self-assembled from aqueous solution and interact with light, understanding how they interact with the biological interface, and then exploring control of this interface for biomedical applications.  From a practical standpoint these new materials are of interest as 'smart' surfaces for sensing, signaling, and controlling biological activity, due to the combination of soft photochemical functionalities, and their biocompatibility.  From the standpoint of fundamental science, these materials enable us to contribute to our basic understanding of biological function at the interface between living cells and artificial growth/regeneration media, from a chemical and materials perspective.

"Intense sociality is a defining feature of humanity, and one that we share with monkeys and apes. The demands of social life are thought to have shaped the size and structure of the brain and the particular way in which we think about the world. To date, work in this area has considered cognition as an abstract, internal process that takes place solely inside the head. Recent work in neurobiology, robotics and cognitive science, however, emphasises that physical, bodily engagement with the world, and with other individuals, should be considered as part and parcel of cognition, and that cognition can, therefore, be both visible and social, and not just invisible and private. From this perspective, development is the key to understanding how animals, including ourselves, come to understand and participate in the social world - development is a process that, by definition, requires physical action and interaction with other individuals. 

The proposed research aims to compare and contrast the socio-cognitive development of juvenile baboons, vervet monkeys and human children from this kind of ""embodied"" and ""distributed"" perspective. Using observational and experimental approaches, we will test predictions concerning the manner in which social interactions both scaffold and shape cognitive development, and assess the influence of emotional and perceptual mechanisms on social understanding. We will also extend the approach to adult humans, where these processes will be investigated in relation to the collaborative forms of problem-solving that have helped humans build and sustain our distinctive cultures over the course of our recent evolutionary history.

As well as providing training and research opportunities for students, this work will offer important insights into the evolution of human cognitive capacities, and has application within educational and occupational settings.

"Smokers and non-smokers differ across a number of domains that are relevant to the ways they perceive and respond to potential reinforcers. Although certain ingredients found in tobacco smoke are known to affect brain systems that are involved in regulating reinforcement, little is currently known about the degree such actions lead to changes to the way smokers perceive and respond to reinforcers. In the proposed research will examine the acute and longer-term effects  nicotine, the non-nicotinic constitutes of tobacco smoke and tobacco withdrawal on various indices of reinforcement sensitivity. It is expected that this work will help delineate the pathogenesis of the various differences between smokers and non-smokers as well as enhance our understanding of basic human reinforcement processes.

"Immobility, hermaphroditism, modularity, and reliance on pollen vectors shape the evolution of plant reproductive diversity. Understanding the evolutionary processes governing transitions in reproductive systems is recognized as a central problem in evolutionary biology since Darwin's pioneering work on plants. Studies of plant reproduction provide some of the best examples of the evolution of adaptation by natural selection and of the maintenance of polymorphisms by frequency-dependent selection. Today, the study of plant reproduction is critical for advances in a range of applied fields, including plant breeding and biotechnology, conservation and invasion biology, and assessment of the environmental consequences of genetically modified organisms. The goal of my research is to understand how and why transitions occur between plant reproductive systems. To achieve this my laboratory exploits the striking intra and interspecific variation in pollination and mating systems evident in many flowering plant groups. We employ diverse approaches to test theoretical models concerned with the evolution and functional significance of sexual diversity. These include phylogeny reconstruction, comparative biology, functional morphology, molecular ecology and the tools of ecological and evolutionary genetics. This grant addresses four general questions concerned with evolutionary transitions. Two are logical extensions of previously funded NSERC projects whereas the other two represent new directions. The research aims at answering the following questions: 1) What selective forces account for variation in gender strategies and sex-ratio variation in dioecious plants? 2) What are the genomic consequences and genetic architecture responsible for the evolution of selfing from outcrossing? 3) In heterostylous plants, what mechanisms cause biased morph ratios and transitions between sexual systems? 4) Why does wind pollination evolve from animal pollination? This research should provide new insights into the evolutionary processes responsible for the spectacular sexual diversity of flowering plants. It will also result in the training of high caliber graduate students & PDFs with broad expertise in ecology & evolutionary biology.",Environnement,Environnement,"Evolution & Ecology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"My main research interest is the study of nucleus-nucleus collisions at relativistic energies. The primary goal of this research is the study of the equation of state of hot hadronic matter and the phase transition to the new phase of matter, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). One of the important finding at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) is that instead of behaving like a gas of free quarks and gluons, as was expected, the hot matter created in high energy heavy-ion collisions appears to be more like a liquid, i.e. a strongly coupled plasma (sQGP) characterized by short mean free path and collective flow.

In the last few years, my main effort has been devoted to the development of a new version of a nuclear collision model called HIJING/BB. The results of this model indicate that the conditions for particle production at RHIC are radically different than at lower energies. The particle production is large and dominated by quark-antiquark and gluon pair production and the energy density appears to exceed the one required for formation of a QGP. Using this model we are studying the modifications of the strong color interaction in the dense nuclear medium produced in these collisions. We have shown that RHIC results are consistent with an average increase of the string tension from its vacuum value 1GeV/fm to an ""in-medium"" value of 2-3 GeV/fm. This is equivalent to a reduction of the effective quark mass in the hot nuclear matter produced at RHIC due to chiral symmetry restoration. In addition we have shown that these modification should lead to a strong enhancement of the production of strange particles (i.e particles containing one or more strange quark). 

We have begun to apply our model to the higher energies that will be available at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN where the strong coupling (sQGP) seen in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC is likely to reduce to a more weakly interacting plasma due to changes in initial conditions of the partonic phase. Finally, we have begun to study the more fundamental nucleon-nucleon collisions at ultra-high energy (Tevatron) where we believe that SCF effects should also be considered

"As long term objective, this research develops sustainable technologies for recycling organic waste and wastewaters, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GGE). Besides other related projects, the objectives of the two main upcoming projects are to improve: composting feasibility to divert 100% of the organic waste from landfills, and; biofilters for CH4 oxidizing to increase their use by livestock enterprises and old landfills. The first main project will investigate the advantages of source separating food waste (SS-FW) compared to mechanically sorting the organic fraction from municipal solid wastes (OF-MSW), within the collaboration started: in 2000 with the Tournesol composting centre of the Montreal Plateau, training 3 undergraduate and 1 M. Sc. students, and; in 2004 with the Rennes Cemagref, France, hosting 1 M. Sc. and 1 Ph. D. student from 2007-09. The Ph. D. student will return to McGill to research SS-FW and OF-MSW for contamination levels and for composting feasibility (treatment time, ventilation requirements, GGE, product quality and stabilization) under controlled laboratory conditions. Thus, municipalities can select the best type of separation method to improve the feasibility of costly composting facilities. Continuing the 2004-06 collaboration with Agriculture and Agro-Food Canada (AAC), the second main project involves biofilters for CH4 oxidation and their improvement by studying the rate of CH4 transfer from the air stream to the biofilter water films, a limiting process. This rate will be investigated in the laboratory under various conditions and using an inert medium of known surface area simulating the biofilter. This gas transfer function will be added to an existing methane biofiltration microbial model, to be calibrated and validated with field data collected in 2004-06 with AAC. The results will be used to optimize the CH4 oxidation of biofilters and lower its application cost. The two main priorities of the 2009-14 program will help reduce GGE from two important sources, agriculture and landfill sites, responsible for 1 and 3% of all Canadian emissions. The project targets a world wide priority aimed at slowing earth warming trends and allowing more time for adaptation measures.

"Computer processing power, processing speed, and memory requirements have increased dramatically in the last ten years. This is due to the ability to construct smaller and higher quality microelectronic devices. In order to maintain this improvement in microelectronics performance, devices must continue to decrease in size while maintaining or improving the quality of the devices. Control over device creation and thus device quality has been greatly enhanced by thin film deposition techniques. The ability to deposit very thin, extremely uniform, and highly reproducible films is a necessity in microelectronic device fabrication. One of the main techniques used in microchip manufacturing today is chemical vapour deposition (CVD), where a vapour of a precursor compound is allowed to thermally react at a substrate surface to deposit a target material while releasing volatile, non-reactive side products. This method has several advantages, the foremost being the deposition of uniform films on complex geometries. The major drawbacks of this technique are inclusion of impurities in the growing film, and control of film thickness, particularly for nanoscale thicknesses. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an innovation of CVD where the initial precursor does not thermally decompose on the substrate. The principal benefit of ALD is the ability to grow films one atom layer at a time. This technique is presently being integrated into microelectronics production to form very thin (~4 atoms in thickness) oxide films in microelectronic transistors. Although control of the thickness of a film is of paramount importance, control of the area of deposition will allow definable, nanoscale features to be formed. This research project proposes to design deposition precursors that will selectively deposit specific target films. The ability to control nanoscale thicknesses of a variety of target films will provide a versatile and powerful method to enable key research and development sectors such as nanotechnology, photonics and microelectronics.  Research in this area will develop the necessary highly qualified personnel to integrate ALD technology into Canadian research and industry","Sciences des mat�riaux","Avancement des connaissances","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Many of apicomplexan parasites (such as malaria, Toxoplasma and coccidia) are of serious veterinary, agricultural and medical importance. Eimeria are continuing and serious challenges to profitable rearing of commercial poultry (especially chickens). Medication costs and production losses from coccidiosis cost the poultry industry several $100 million each year in Canada. Live vaccines against coccidia are possible but are complicated by immunologically distinct strains of many Eimeria species and alteration to the intestinal tract that can predispose chickens to bacterial disease (esp. necrotic enteritis). We have distinct lines of E. maxima that are similar to one another but do not cross-immunize birds (they do not protect against challenge with the second strain despite their similarity). The few differences that exist between these E. maxima strains must be important targets of a protective immune response. The strains will continue to be dissected at the molecular level to identify unique molecules in each strain that may represent immunologically important antigens that the chickens use to protect themselves against challenge; this hypothesis will be tested once the unique molecules have been isolated. This is critical for the generation of non-viable vaccines against coccidia.  Second, the immune responses of birds will be examined when infected with one strain of the parasite and then challenged with the second strain. To address the limitations of live vaccines in broiler chickens (because of an altered gut environment that promotes serious bacterial enteritis), probiotic bacteria (harmless, beneficial commensal bacteria isolated from chickens) will be tested for their ability to protect the intestinal tract of birds during live coccidial vaccination. If proven, this method could radically reduce our reliance on in-feed drugs currently employed to control these parasites in meat birds. Finally, in other work, we hope to better understand the evolutionary relationships that exist among all parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa. In addition to better understanding our biological world, characterizing poorly known parasites will give us a way to predict likely life cycles, potential hosts and possible drug sensitivities for agents of emerging parasitic disease.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"The requested funds are for the study of geophysical fluid turbulence employing high-resolution numerical simulations and analytical techniques.  It goes without saying that our attempts to understand scientifically the big environmental questions of the day are extremely dependent on numerical models of the atmosphere - ocean - cryosphere - land surface system. Yet these are faced with the enormous complication of the true system. In order to account for all important physical effects, numerical shortcuts have to be made. Most important of these is that the simulated range of length and time scales, as determined by model resolution, is extremely reduced compared to reality.  The victim of this brutal simplification is the turbulent mixing of all of the quantities of interest.  In order to know anything about the future distributions of such vital things as carbon dioxide, ozone, pollution, etc, one needs to know their sources, their sinks and how the atmosphere-ocean system mixes them. The focus of this research is on the latter with the view that understanding turbulent mixing is a necessary first step to being able to account for it when it is not explicitly resolved.   Specifically, the influence of aspects of the atmospheric and oceanic setting, such as rotation and stratification, will continue to be identified.  For example, the nonlinear interactions between the resulting wave motion and the vortices, ubiquitous in turbulent flows, will be a primary focus.  A number of detailed topics are presented below.  They include a heightened focus on the anisotropy of passive tracer mixing, the effect of condensation and evaporation of water in this setting, the change of predictability caused by moisture, the challenging limit of stably-stratified turbulence when rotation is weak (at the heart of mesoscale meteorology and the most difficult limit in boundary-layer turbulence), the breakdown of higher-order balance and the role of small-scale vortex tube stretching in extreme events. The dependence of this work on numerical simulation implies that it is a rapidly-evolving field and research on numerical methods will continue to be undertaken in parallel.  My group has been at the forefront of this type of research and has a proven track record of being useful in this regard.

"The systematic introduction of personal armors in theatres of war has decreased soldier mortality. However, due to their weight and rigidity, typical protection systems only cover the torso. As a result, while the occurrence of chest injuries has been significantly reduced, the rates of injuries to the limbs, head and neck are still high. This project is part of a research effort towards lighter and more effective individual armor systems. A novel hybrid composite material consisting of alumina and boron carbide inclusions in a CrS-Cr cermet (ceramic-metal) matrix will be developed. This lightweight material will be designed using numerical models and multiscale optimization to resist ballistic and blast wave threats. In particular, mechanisms such as projectile tip defeat, energy dissipation and stress wave mitigation will be sought at the design stage. The hybrid composite will be fabricated using a Self-propagating High-temperature Synthesis (SHS) process. Sulfur powder, mixed with chromium powder, is first melted and cast in a graphite mold. After solidification, a gasless combustion wave is initiated to convert the precursor mixture into an extremely hard and light cermet. High-purity ceramic inclusions will be incorporated in the cermet matrix to further enhance the ballistic properties. SHS is extremely versatile and offers multiple advantages over existing techniques: it is highly flexible in terms of the article shape, composition and bonding to other materials, it requires a minimum of raw materials and energy input, and it produces a minimum amount of waste. The materials produced will be tested in quasi-static, ballistic and blast-loading conditions in order to validate the numerical models and to assess the performance of the optimized product. This novel armor system has the potential to greatly benefit Canadian

soldiers and law enforcement officers. In addition, the modeling and optimization techniques developed here can be used for the development of other types of hybrid composites. Finally, SHS is an extremely efficient technique which can be adapted and scaled for applications in a wide variety of industrial sectors.","C�ramique, verre et autres produits min�raux industriels","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Manufacturing",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"Billions of years of evolution have produced extremely efficient natural materials, which are increasingly becoming a source of inspiration for engineers. In materials science, biomimetics (the science of imitating nature) is now starting to inspire novel materials with extraordinary mechanical properties. This research focuses on the mechanical performance of hard biological tissues (seashells, teeth), and on the development of novel ""bio-inspired"" structures and materials. For example nacre, found inside many species of seashells, is 3000 times tougher than the fragile ceramic of which it is made (aragonite). This degree of improvement is currently not matched by man-made composite materials, but nature demonstrates that it is possible. Tooth enamel and dentin are other examples of tough materials combined to withstand intense mechanical and thermal loading over many years. The goal of this research is to understand how the microstructure of these materials controls their mechanical performance. We use experiments and computer simulations to study mechanisms at the macroscale, at the microscale and at the nanoscale (one billionth of a meter). More specifically, our investigations focus on: (i) the deformation and fracture of nacreous shells and teeth, focusing on the micromechanisms which prevent cracks from propagating; (ii) the nanoscale mechanics that control the behavior of the interfaces between the mineral inclusions; (iii) how these materials perform as structural systems (for example: enamel and dentin in tooth); and (iv) establishing design rules enabling the duplication of key mechanisms into artificial materials. In the context of long-term objectives, we will fabricate novel bio-inspired materials: large scale model materials to demonstrate key concepts, high performance composites for aerospace and armor systems, or ceramic coatings with enhanced adhesion.

"Although Canadians own a huge inventory of existing infrastructure, very little guidance is available to engineers designing its rehabilitation.  The proposed research program will (1) develop, and validate by physical testing, design methodology for concrete highway bridge rehabilitation, (2) support development of a landmark new American Concrete Institute Committee 562 Standard for evaluation and rehabilitation of concrete structures, and (3) determine, using numerical modeling and full-scale experimental investigation at a new CFI-funded laboratory, the load paths in typical wood-frame houses to develop evidence-based code criteria for improving the robustness of houses subjected to extreme winds.

   The bridge rehabilitation work will include analytical methods, validated by experimental studies, for two difficult issues routinely encountered in practice: the impact of restrained shrinkage in new concrete that is cast against existing concrete and the mechanics of concrete members with reinforcement that is temporarily exposed, and so unbonded, during the rehabilitation.

   The research for the ACI Standard will derive load combinations to check the safety of concrete structures during and after rehabilitation based on the consequence of failure of the component being rehabilitated.

   The experimental investigation of wood-frame housing will take place at the Insurance Research Lab for Better Homes, a new $7 M laboratory capable of subjecting full-scale houses to the temporally and spatially varying loads of an extreme wind storm.  Load cells within and beneath the test house specimen will capture the load paths within the structure, investigate how they change as damage occurs, and validate analytical predictions obtained using finite element software.  Rehabilitation procedures can then be developed based on a clear understanding of how the house responds to load.

   The funds requested will train 6 PhD and 3 MESc students to become the next generation of stewards of Canada's infrastructure.

"Reproductive tissue cancers are of primary concern for biomedical research, with prostate and breast cancers being the most frequent forms seen in men and women, respectively. Ovarian cancers continue to be a leading gynaecological cause of death in North American women. As conventional cancer therapy has proven less than ideal, the search for a more selective type of treatment has lead to the development of conjugated lytic peptides. The conjugated lytic peptides consist of small, cell-disrupting peptides linked to the fragments of gonadotropin hormones, allowing them to target cancer tissue specifically expressing the lutropin/choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor. A distinct advantage of targeting breast, prostate and ovarian cancers with the lytic peptide conjugated to the fragment of CG molecule is that reproductive tissues and reproductive tissue cancers express the LH/CG receptor in much greater abundance than other tissues throughout the body. In mice, conjugated lytic peptides have been able to effectively destroy cancer cells and reduce the tumour burden while reportedly causing little damage to healthy organs. However, there is a lack of information on their effects on normal ovarian structures during different stages of the ovulatory cycle. Thus, the aim of the proposed studies is to determine the effects of one such conjugate, Phor21-�CG(ala) and its enantiomer �CG(ala)-Phor21, on the ovarian processes governed by endogenous LH. As an initial approach, ultrasound images and reproductive hormone measurements will be used for real-time assessment of antral follicular development, ovulation and luteal structures, using sheep as an experimental model. It is predicted that the dense expression of LH receptors on the preovulatory follicle and corpus luteum (CL) will present an appropriate target the conjugates, and disrupt normal ovarian function. As these drugs move towards human clinical trials, it is of great importance to have evidence indicating their effects on the dynamic processes in the ovaries, in a large mammalian animal model. This may have important bearing on the use of Phor21-�CG(ala) and �CG(ala)-Phor21 as therapeutic agents, or potentially in a contraceptive role or as a research tool in the future.

"Faces are some of the most complex visual stimuli that the human brain processes. An important question in research on object recognition is how the visual system organizes and accesses neural representations of faces. Adaptation is a powerful experimental technique: by examining how responses to different faces are affected by preview of a particular face, we can understand what the system encodes about faces, how these are represented, and how these representations interact. We have developed a new adaptation technique that asks how the amount of contrast needed to perceive a specific face is affected by preview of the same or other faces. Our technique has shown that a short preview facilitates perception of the same face, but inhibits perception of other faces. We can use this effect to ask a series of key questions. Does the degree of inhibition depend upon the similarity of the other face to the adapting face? Is there a distinct segregation of face space by gender? How do representations of the identity of the face and representations of facial expression interact? Is the organization of these representations dependent on face-expert mechanisms that are not available when faces are seen upside-down? Our plan is to test the hypotheses driving these questions and use computational models of neural networks to simulate the findings and to suggest how the neural representations of these complex visual stimuli might be organized and interact. This type of knowledge will advance our understanding of the storage of object information and the mechanisms that contribute to the rapid and effortless recognition performance of the human visual system.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"This interdisciplinary art/science research collaboration explores how motion can express meaningful and

semantically rich information. Motion has a rich capacity to evoke sophisticated affect and express certain

qualities that evoke the impression of emotion, personality and attitude. We propose to explore the

development of semantics of motion that can be used to convey meaning in the abstract representations

expressed through interaction and information visualization in the context of science as well as art. Our

collaboration involves developing innovative interdisciplinary methodologies informing the creation of new

technologies and new artistic practice and the application ofthese new approaches to enhancing user

experience in the digital environments used in performance, visualization and games. The artistic research will

inform the scientific model-building process by providing knowledge in movement experience, expression and

analysis used in the domains of dance, choreography and theatre. Tools, techniques and models evolved in the

collaborative research workshops will be used to prototype and test art-installations that explore motion as

content and as interaction.

From the scientific perspective we seek to develop an experimentally validated, computationally realizable

semantics ofmotion that models both meaning and expressive interaction. The scientific goals are twofold 1)

to mine creative disciplines ofmovement and expression for a deeper understanding ofthe communicative

"A high spatial resolution optical microscopic imaging modality will be developed for non-invasive deep tissue imaging in living organisms. The laser scanning microscope will be designed to image cells in biological tissue based on back scattered second harmonic generation and third harmonic generation signals. The harmonic generation image contrast is obtained without staining allowing noninvasive detection of the cells in living tissue. The advanced pulse shaping technology will be employed to coherently control the excitation and compensate for distortions of the laser pulses occurring during the beam propagation in the sample. The beam distortion correction will enable researchers to visualize cells buried hundreds of microns deep into the tissue. The new concept of the locked reference position scanning will be implemented. This laser scanning method will eliminate the image blurring occurring during investigation of moving biological tissue in whole organism imaging.

The microscope will be applied for cancer diagnostics in patients. The recommendations will be deduced for designing a clinical microscope and endoscope as well as portable femtosecond laser needed for the microscopic imaging. The new imaging modality will assist researchers in visualizing the cells in tissue of a whole organism. The nonlinear excitation microscope will speed up tremendously the clinical diagnostic procedures for detection of cancer cells. Canadian companies will obtain benefit from the microscopy technology transfer and generate revenues by commercializing the microscope and supplying it to the hospitals. Most importantly, the nonlinear microscopic imaging modality will help doctors in diagnosing and treating patients, and will aid to save lives.

"Optical microscopy is among the most powerful tools that enable to investigate non-invasively living cells and biological tissue. The proposed new non-linear optical microscope features the shaping unit that is able to manipulate spectral and spatial profiles of the laser beam, as well as adjust the temporal phasing and polarization of different spectral components of the femtosecond pulse. The custom shaped femtosecond pulses will be used for coherent control excitation of fluorophores in the biological samples. The optimized laser pulses will enhance the efficiency of fluorophore excitation and reduce photobleaching. The femtosecond pulse chirp modulation will enable to image the pH distribution inside the cells. The coherent control microscope will be built on the basis of already existing state-of-the-art multimodal non-linear laser scanning microscope capable of simultaneously recording third and second harmonic generation, and multiphoton excitation fluorescence images. The unique instrument will be used to investigate bioenergetics of mitochondria during contraction of myocytes. The microscope will also be applied to elucidate regulation mechanisms of light harvesting in single isolated and in situ chloroplasts. The new microscope will serve as a platform for creation of new non-linear imaging modalities for non-invasive biological investigations.","Sciences physiques","Avancement des connaissances","General Physics",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"Subtilisin Kexin Isozyme-1 (SKI-1) also known as Site1Protease (S1P) is a proteolytic enzyme found within cellular compartments of various tissues of mammalian systems, including human. This enzyme cleaves larger, inactive protein molecules at specific sites, to generate functionally active smaller protein forms that play important roles in various health conditions and diseases, including viral infections and cholesterol synthesis. In all cases, an increase in enzyme activity of SKI-1 results in the formation of a higher level of biologically active cleaved product/s that eventually contribute to the initiation or progression of the disease. One way of managing the disease will be to lower down the activity of the enzyme via the application of chemical agents that interact and  bind with the enzyme, thereby blocking its activity. In fact this approach has been applied for intervention of many diseases including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, arthritis, asthma and AIDS. For more than a decade, our laboratory has been engaged in studying structure, function and activity of several enzymes including SKI-1. In this proposal we intend to develop compounds that are capable of inhibiting the ability of the SKI-1 enzyme to cleave large inactive proteins to their small functionally active forms. Thus, we will prepare several SKI-1 inhibitory compounds based on various strategies which can inactivate SKI-1 and make it less efficient in cutting large proteins. In theory these compounds are expected to find important applications, not only to study the function of the enzyme, but also in therapeutic interventions of diseases such as viral infections, hypercholesterolemia etc. This research will therefore contribute to a better understanding of the importance of SKI-1 in above diseases and could lead to novel compounds with important therapeutic values.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Northern forests and peatlands are exceptionally important in part because they store vast amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide as organic matter in soils, exchange methane with the atmosphere, and support forestry and peat natural resource industries. Canada is the world's largest exporter of forest products and contains the world's second largest peatland area. Soil microbial communities are responsible for the net release of greenhouse gasses from soils and simultaneously cycle nutrients that are essential for ecosystem productivity. Presently there is still a great deal unknown about the role of microbial communities in soil processes and this leads to uncertainties in our understanding of ecosystem behavior. The aim of this research is to use novel molecular and stable-isotope probing techniques, in conjunction with more classical approaches, to link soil microbial communities to ecosystem processes that have vast importance for climate change and sustainable resource management. Specifically this work will: 1) Compare and contrast microbial communities and ecosystem functioning across Canadian peatlands and forests that are hydrologically and biogeochemically connected. 2) Determine if silvicultural treatments including selection harvesting, thinning, forest fertilization, and clearcutting and new peat harvesting methods that will be used for extracting peat for alternative fuel in Ontario preserve important soil microbial diversity and functioning. 3) Identify specific microbial communities that, over time, transform plant material to soil organic matter and then to carbon dioxide and methane. Working across ecosystems, in applied settings with environmental disturbances, will be significant for both improving ecosystem and resource management in Canada and for providing a large gradient of environments to explore more fundamental principles of soil microbial ecology. The projects will train graduate and undergraduate students and provide them unique exposure to Canadian government researchers directly involved in natural resource management in Ontario and to national and international university research collaborators.",Environnement,"D�veloppement du nord","Evolution & Ecology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Modern speech recognition systems remain challenged in noisy environments despite all the technical advances that have been made to enhance their capabilities. There has been significant research work to address the effect of noise and word ambiguities on recognition performance. For speech recognition systems to be of practical use in noisy environments, such as in automobile, crowded areas and/or simultaneous human computer discourse applications, the issue of robustness must be addressed. The applicant maintains that this can possibly be accomplished by utilizing other sensing modalities to complement the acoustic signal of the speech. An example in line with this strategy is to fuse visual lip movements and expressions with the acoustic signal of the speech so as to maximize information gathering about the words uttered and to minimize the impact of acoustic noise.

Understanding speech from visual information is an attractive approach that has captured the interest of many researchers to improve speech recognition performance. Not only does this approach have the potential to improve speech recognition performance but it may also be possible for speech impaired people to interact with devices in human machine interfacing applications.

In this research project the applicant investigates the integration of audio and visual lip movement features (during speech signal production) to detect and recognize spoken phrases. A multi-modal fusion system will be designed. The system should be able to acquire visual and acoustic signals of speech and fuse them to detect and recognize words spoken by the speaker in a noisy environment. The system will also be tuned and tested in situations where the speaker is speech impaired. It is expected that the proposed research project will result in the training of 6 highly qualified personnel in human machine interfacing- an area of strategic importance to the Canadian economy.

"Renix Inc. (London, Ontario) has licensed a novel and potentially revolutionary ion exchange technology from the University of Western Ontario termed as the Liquid Solid Circulating Fluidized Bed (LSCFB) Ion Exchanger. The LSCFB system uses two liquids in different ways in order to accomplish the ion exchange steps of adsorption, desorption, and to maintain dynamic seals. Although the system functions well under the existing configurations, it uses large quantities of water and eluant chemicals. In order to improve the system and make it more attractive for industrial application, this project will evaluate several potential modifications that will reduce the consumption of chemicals and water. Water Use: Water is used in two places in the system in order to keep the feed liquid isolated in the adsorption column and the chemical eluant isolated in the

desorption column. In order to attempt to reduce water usage, new configurations of the lower sections of adsorber and separator as well as the orientation of the solids recirculation lines will be developed and tested at the lab scale. Eluant Chemical Usage: Strongly ionic chemical species are used for regeneration of the resin in the fluidized desorption column. Due to the height of the column and the need to entrain the resin particles to move them up through to the separator, high volumes of chemical are used. Several modifications to lower the chemical use are suggested however this needs to be addressed and investigated. In order to attempt to reduce chemical usage, new configurations of the desorption column, the lower solids recirculation line, and/or the separator will be developed and tested at the lab scale and the pilot scale.","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Ontario Internal Decision Committee",1,"EGP   ","Engage Grants Program                                                                               ",Ontario,Ontario

"During virus infections, the immune system with its complex network composed of many immune cells need to signal the right messages to eradicate the foreign pathogen. These messages are what we refer to as cytokines, which are mainly cellular proteins. These cytokines interact with cells of the immune system to facilitate the body's response to infection. A controlled cytokine production is indicative of a healthy immune response that should resolve the infection. On the other hand if the cytokines are produced at very high levels, they could lead to tissue damage due to an over active immune response. Conversely, a low production of the cytokines would imply immunosuppression and may be associated with the inability to clear the infection in a timely manner. Cytokines are released by immune cells into the circulation and can be measured by different means. A common approach to measure the induction of these cytokines is to employ a technique known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This technique allows for the detection of cytokine gene activation. This is a complex but very reliable technique that necessitates specialized equipments that we currently need in our laboratory. To accomplish this, we need to acquire a Microcentrifuge needed for sample preparation at 4�C. We also require Dual Fast Reaction Thermal Cycler which will allow to perform more tests and optimize our reactions at two different settings simultaneously. Thus, the equipments we are asking for will enhance the training and progress of the trainees' research. In particular, it will improve the training of our current team comprised of a post-doc researcher, a master student, two PhD graduate students and one undergraduate student.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Genes, Cells and Molecules",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)",Ontario,Ontario

"The proposed research aims to design methods for nonconvex stochastic programming, applied to practical problems arising in industry and engineering, for instance discrete choice modeling for transportation.



This research follows three main axes. The first axis concerns the study of adaptive sampling methods for nonconvex stochastic programming, based on traditional Monte Carlo techniques, but also more advanced strategies as randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods. The objective is to speed-up the optimization process, while ensuring consistency properties and convergence of the developed algorithms. These techniques will be applied in engineering field, in particular for discrete choice modeling. The second axis is focused on structure exploitation during the optimization procedure. Interesting structures, indeed, are often present in particular instances of stochastic programs, such as problems coming from mixed logit estimation and multistage nonconvex stochastic programming. In the first case, it is possible to consider specific Hessian approximations in order to speed-up the convergence of the optimization methods, as with least-squares programs. In the second case, it is possible to exhibit parallelism properties, in the context of interior point methods. The last axis treats nonparametric estimation, in particular for mixed logit models, while the idea can be extended to various stochastic programs where random distribution parameters are to be estimated. We then aim to develop methods that avoid any a priori assumptions on the underlying distributions, but instead allow the construction of arbitrary distributions along with the estimation process.

"In the past decade, pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and other synthetic organic compounds have been found in wastewater effluent, and in drinking water supplies. Due to their potential impact on aquatic life and human health  a key topic of interest in research and society is the removal of these compounds  from water. Membrane-bioreactor (MBR) systems with biofiltration may be one tool available to remove these compounds from water through microbial degradation. 



MBR systems combine conventional processes such as coagulation, aeration, activated sludge, and physical filtration into one unit, allowing for a compact design and potential improvements in produced water quality. However, the limitation to membrane implementation is fouling. Membrane fouling impedes on the production of treated water, increasing operational and maintenance costs. Membrane fouling is comprised of four main areas: organic fouling, biofouling, colloidal fouling, and scaling. Each type of fouling requires different strategies to minimize and control in order to prevent loss of water production. Therefore, it is important to understand what type of fouling occurs in a given MBR system. Currently, Canadian and US, PhAC/EDC research is mainly focused on removal at drinking water plants,  although these compounds originate at the wastewater (sewage) plant. This research will assesss removal of these compounds at the wastewater plant. A wastewater MBR combined with a biofilter system may be more effective at treatment due to the diverse nature of microbes present in wastewater plants. The overall scientific approach will assess the removal of individual PhACs/EDCs in conjunction with the type and severity of fouling that occurs on the membranes in the MBR and biofilter system.

"Star formation results from some of the most fundamental processes known to physics. Yet, a complete understanding has been elusive due to the complex, nonlinear combination of gravity, electromagnetic forces, thermal physics, angular momentum, and turbulent motions. I propose to push forward our physical understanding of star formation through a series of computational experiments blended with theoretical insight and detailed comparison with the latest observational data. 



Astronomy is in a golden age of progress, benefiting from an imminent avalanche of data and ever-increasing realism of theoretical modeling. For example, Herschel and ALMA will significantly increase our census of star-forming regions and allow detailed mapping of the nearest regions. Simultaneously, computer simulations like the ones we propose will unveil the process of star formation. We will run three-dimensional models of the formation of collapsing cores within larger interstellar clouds, as well as model the collapse of individual cores that lead to the formation of protostars and surrounding protoplanetary disks. We will be ready with detailed predictions as decisive observational tests become increasingly viable. A vigorous interaction with observational astronomers will allow us to both rule in and rule out various theoretical scenarios that are being debated in the literature.

"Results from field and laboratory rearing experiments indicate that total tannin fraction of balsam fir tree foliage appears to serve as mechanisms of host resistance to spruce budworm. However, the specific tannins involved and their individual mode of action remain to be investigated. I hypothesize that specific foliar tannins act synergically to influence larval survival and growth by interfering with larval food utilization processes and that these specific tannins have different modes of action on budworm larvae. This hypothesis will be tested using gravimetric, behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological studies on larvae reared on artificial diet supplemented with various levels and combinations of pure chemicals extracted from foliage. According to the local-adaptation hypothesis, the spatial heterogeneity in nutritive, defensive, or phenological traits within populations of long-lived plants structures populations of short-lived, specialized herbivores into demes (genetically different populations) adapted to the phenotypes of individual hosts.  I hypothesize that food quality deterioration (change in host phenotype caused by successive insect defoliation) during an outbreak exerts a selective pressure on budworm population that changes gene frequency of the population which in turn leads to a better adaptation to poor feeding conditions. Reciprocal transfert experiments will be conducted over four  successive generations of insect under laboratory conditions using postdiapausing siblings and fresh foliage from damaged stands or foliage from undamaged stands. Spruce budworm biological performances will be documented and quantitative genetic analysis performed. Additional laboratory rearing experiments will be conducted using high and low quality diets to investigate the processes involved in the impact of nutritional stress on spruce budworm over several generations.  I hypothesize that, through selective pressure, nutritional stress imposed on spruce budworms over several generations modifies larval development and food utilization, optimal nutrient balance and responses to positive and negative food quality changes (nutrient and secondary compounds).

"Research conducted in one field is often highly relevant to problems encountered in other fields, or in real-world applications of research.  However, disciplinary barriers can prevent the communication across fields required to translate this information into progress.  In my proposed research, partly through close interdisciplinary collaborations, I will translate tools and methods from population biology into other fields where they are needed.  In particular, these methods will be applied to problems in the welfare of human populations: (1) understanding human behaviour under voluntary vaccination policies, (2) improving evidence-based assessments of health technologies, and (3) studying problems in modern demography.  With respect to voluntary vaccination policy, for instance, it has been noted that disease prevalence and human vaccinating behaviour can influence one another in a dynamic interplay: higher vaccine coverage causes less disease, which reduces the incentive to vaccinate, which in turn may bring about more disease.  My research proposes to combine models of disease transmission through social networks with economic game theory approaches to better understand voluntary vaccination, and why vaccine-averse parents (in game theoretical terms, ""cheaters"") threaten some voluntary vaccination policies but not others.   My research also proposes to investigate how such social network models, as well as other advanced infectious disease modelling techniques, can improve our ability to make rigorous evidence-based assessments of new health technologies such as vaccines and antibiotics.  A third project in this proposal involves adopting a population biological perspective to declining birth rates in advanced countries.  Population biologists have long studied the relationship between fertility and resources, and therefore may have unique and insightful perspectives on this demographic problem and its long-term implications for both advanced and lower-income countries.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances",Interdisciplinary,1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Building a quantum computer is one of the great scientific and engineering challenges of our time. A quantum processor stores and manipulates an amount of information that is exponential in the number of elementary bits, in contrast to classical information processing which is linear in the bit number. A quantum computer represents the most general type of information processor allowed by the known laws of physics, and it has been proven that a quantum computer can solve certain problems that are classically intractable. Efforts to build quantum processors are bolstered by the theoretical results of quantum fault tolerance, which prove that, in principle, decoherence of quantum states is not a fundamental obstacle to quantum computing as long as the error rate is below a threshold. 

To build such a device, we need building blocks that are capable of performing universal quantum logic operations, can maintain coherent quantum states over a large number of operations, and can be efficiently integrated into a large-scale architecture. Just as solid-state (semiconductor) technology has allowed modern classical information processors to reach incredible speeds and information densities, appropriately designed solid-state quantum devices will provide a scalable, practical solution for realizing quantum processors. Our approach encodes quantum information in the spin of individual electrons confined in mesoscopic devices called quantum dots. The intrinsic physics of our devices allows single spins to be manipulated with much higher speed and fidelity than has previously been demonstrated. We aim to show, for the first time, universal quantum logic in a scalable multi-qubit system in which both one- and two-qubit operations can be carried out on a timescale of nanoseconds. Fast gate operations will be crucially important for overcoming decoherence and for performing large-scale quantum computations in future devices. This Research Tools and Instruments Grant will fund a set of electronics instrumentation that will work together with existing infrastructure and devices to enable fast quantum logic.

"As classical information processing has shaped today's society, technology and economy through advances in computing and communication, harnessing quantum information will lead to fundamentally more powerful devices and even greater impacts.  The power of quantum information lies in the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics, in which the non-classical concepts of superposition, entanglement and quantum parallelism arise.  Not only are quantum algorithms such as Shor's factoring algorithm more powerful than their classical counterparts, quantum information processing (QIP) is the key to continuing to make computers smaller and faster.  Since the classical world breaks down when we approach the atomic scale, today's computers will soon reach a fundamental barrier to further miniaturization.  On the other hand, using quantum mechanics as a new paradigm for information processing bypasses this roadblock.  Taking the ideas and concepts of quantum information theory and implementing them physically is crucial to the development of quantum technologies that will dominate in the 21st century.



The goal of our research is to significantly impact the science and technology of physically realized quantum devices, by developing prototype devices and the quantum control and measurement techniques necessary for QIP.  Our particular focus is on using the particle property of spin to encode quantum information in a robust way.  Realizing spin-based quantum bits (qubits) in solid-state systems offers a technologically attractive path to scalable quantum devices: this approach is reminiscent of (and builds on) the semiconductor electronics industry, and is poised to benefit from cutting edge technologies now being developed based on novel nanostructured materials. This proposal is for the development of a comprehensive research program aimed at addressing the fundamental and technical challenges of realizing quantum devices.  This research will expand current scientific knowledge and create new platforms for technological innovation.","Machinerie et �quipement �lectriques et �lectroniques (y compris mat�riel informatique)","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Condensed Matter Physics",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"The proposed research deals with the synthesis of novel molecular materials suitable for application in electronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), transistors or solar cells. The electronic nature of the materials investigated is extraordinary with respect to emission color, intensity and adjustability. The applied research strategy uses the so-called 'bottom-up' approach, in which functional materials are built up from the atomic scale to afford smart molecular materials. Within this proposal, phosphorus and sulfur atoms are built into carbon-based molecules to afford materials with electronic properties similar to those of silicon. Incorporation of these smart molecules into polymers provides materials that can be used in solar cells. One of the major advantages of the novel materials is their size. Electronic devices based on molecular materials can be about 10 to 100 times smaller than the smallest silicon semiconductor devices and can be operated much more efficiently at much smaller voltages than the established materials. In the case of solar cell applications, these materials even help to generate power. A significantly better energy conversion has become increasingly important in recent years with the fossil energy resources diminishing. In this context, alternative, energy saving ways to generate light of different colors as well as white light is another important aspect that can be accomplished with the new molecular materials. OLEDs are already well established in flat panel displays of digital cameras or cell phones and can also be found in automotive parts such as dashboard illumination or back lights and might replace the commonly established technologies eventually.

The convex feasibility problem asks to find a point (a ""solution"") in the intersection of nonempty closed convex sets (the ""constraints"") in some Hilbert space. It is of fundamental importance in mathematics and the physical sciences due to the large number of problems that can be formulated as convex feasibility problems. 



     Projection algorithms are iterative methods for solving convex feasibility problems. A solution is approximated by combining the projections onto the constraints. The most famous of these methods, POCS (Projections Onto Convex Sets), generates a sequence by projecting cyclically onto the constraints.



     In my research, I will investigate the behaviour of POCS in the inconsistent case. This is important in practice since - due to measurement errors or ""noisy data"" - a convex feasibility problem may fail to have any solution. My aim is to explain the asymptotic behaviour of POCS, which will help users of POCS to interpret the data it produces. To achieve this goal, the inconsistent case of POCS will be analyzed within the broader context of duality theory for finding zeros of the sum of maximal monotone operators. 

     

     I will also explore corresponding questions for proximal mappings, which are basic building blocks of modern convex optimization algorithms. In addition, the acceleration of projection algorithms will be examined both theoretically and practically. The practical part of this research, carried out by a team of researchers from UBC Okanagan and from the B.C. Cancer agency, will focus on the Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment planning problem.

"Hydrogen is an attractive automotive fuel because it burns without releasing CO2 or other greenhouse gases, and because it is the fuel of choice for fuel cells. Hydrogen production from hydro power or wind energy is carbon-neutral. However, because hydrogen has a markedly different behaviour when compared with hydrocarbon fuels, there are significant safety issues that need to be resolved before widespread hydrogen storage and distribution facilities are allowed in close contact with populated areas.  Likewise, there are safety issues associated with hydrogen storage in vehicles in tunnels and public garages.  Because hydrogen is very light and buoyant, outdoors installations can be made safe by ensuring that there is enough distance around where the public is not allowed. However, in enclosed environments, serious issues remain, mostly associated with the risk of detonation, which hydrogen is much more prone to than other fuels. Detonation is the most violent form of combustion, in which combustion rides on a shock wave which it also supports.  Thus detonation waves travel at high supersonic speeds as long as they encounter combustible mixture, and they entail a pressure increase usually in the tens of atmospheres, which is quite destructive and could result in accidents more serious than for instant the recent Mont-Blanc tunnel accident. Unfortunately, major uncertainties remain on the mechanisms leading to detonation, even for hydrogen, the chemistry of which is better known than other more complex fuels, at least at relatively low pressures. In addition, there is reliable experimental evidence showing that a sudden release of high pressure hydrogen into the atmosphere may ignite spontaneously, under a mechanism that is not well understood either. The goal of the current work is to clarify the relationship between specific features of hydrogen chemistry and both appearance of a detonation and spontaneous jet ignition. To that effect, numerical simulation and mathematical analysis will be performed for a hierarchy of scenarios, starting from relatively simple ones to increasingly more complex and realistic ones.

"Healthy ageing is correlated with experience and wisdom.  At the same time, there is a decline in optimal functioning of various systems of the body.  After the age of 55 years, the cells in the spinal cord, which control our muscles, slowly start to die, and consequently, muscles become smaller.  However, exercise at any age can slow down the decline in our muscular strength.  In addition to physical changes, the areas of the brain that control movement also change their activity patterns.  The proposed project seeks to examine some of those changes.  A few of the experiments are designed to investigate how reflexes and reaction times in older adults differ from those of younger adults.  Other experiments are designed to see if the older nervous system is still plastic and capable of improved function.  For example, how much control do older adults have in changing their reflexes and reactions times compared to younger adults?  Can older adults learn to enhance their reflexes and reaction times as much as younger adults can?  Recent reports in the literature have shown the young adult brain to be very plastic, meaning that practice of a particular movement can quickly reorganize the brain connections.  We will address whether this is also the case in older adults.  Training the motor system improves balance, cardio-respiratory systems, gastrointestinal function, blood flow to the brain - the general functioning of our bodies.  Although it is true that playing chess or doing crossword puzzles can improve our mental abilities, improving mental abilities alone will not keep the elderly population physically independent.  However, learning new motor skills, which are optimized for age, will  benefit the brain, as well as the physique.

"This application is submitted by two primary investigators at York University and requests funds for the purchase of two shaker incubators and accessories for the dedicated growth and study of the yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  For the primary applicant, this equipment will be used specifically for the growth of S. pombe for the establishment of genetic screens searching for conserved regulators and factors important in cellular growth, metabolism and the response of cells to environmental stress, in agreement with this applicant's recently funded Discovery grant application.  This is of fundamental scientific importance, as such factors are often highly conserved between lower organisms such as yeast and higher systems, including humans.  Insight into such processes should not only provide valuable information into the nature of evolutionarily conserved adaptations to stress and metabolic processes found in all life forms, but could also illuminate paths of divergence between microbial organisms and higher organisms, providing potentially novel targets for anti-microbial compounds.  For the secondary applicant, the requested equipment will be used primarily for growing S. cerevisiae to carry out the functional studies of the yeast PHD domain proteins, which was recently funded by an NSERC discovery grant.   The objective of this project is to reveal the cellular interactions with different yeast PHD domain proteins and the effect of these interactions on normal cellular processes. This equipment will be essential to success of the projects of both laboratories, as there is no suitable and dedicated shaker available for the proposed research at York. This equipment will be made available to members of other research groups in the department and will be used in training of highly qualified personnel.

"The capacity to adapt to environmental stresses is critical for the viability of all life forms. The molecular players and pathways by which microbes respond to stress are often evolutionarily conserved in higher organisms. A major goal of my research program is to identify the mechanisms underlying the activation and regulation of an evolutionarily conserved stress adaptation known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the genetically and biochemically tractable model organism, Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast). The UPR is found in all higher organisms and is used to overcome a number of environmental challenges.  Furthermore, the ability activate an effective UPR has been implicated in disease states. For several metabolic processes, fission yeast has been characterized as the most representative microbe in terms of evolutionary conservation with higher organisms, but its UPR remains to be described. One direction of my research program is to address this knowledge gap and provide significant insight into the regulation of the UPR in S. pombe and the nature of its evolutionary conservation and divergence. A separate but related element of my research program involves the La protein. This conserved cellular factor is critical to the normal maturation of various nucleic acid species (tRNAs) in the cell and also controls the expression of certain gene products at the RNA level. Importantly, it is thought to regulate the UPR through as yet unknown mechanisms. As my previous work has shown extensive conservation of La function between fission yeast and higher organisms, including humans, my research program will focus on delineating the function of this protein in the UPR of S. pombe and in the regulation of other RNAs more generally. The results of the proposed work will be used to develop comprehensive models for genetic regulation in stress responses. The elucidation of mechanisms of stress adaptation in S. pombe will be useful in extrapolating related pathways in higher organisms, and may provide insight into the characterization of microbial growth conditions and the design of new anti-microbials.

"Wetlands in western Canada have been disappearing rapidly due to agricultural/urban expansion and industrial land development, and are further stressed by climate warming. Most locations in the central Prairie Provinces already have temperatures 2-3 degrees warmer than in the mid 20th century and many wetlands are exhibiting decreased water levels; and temperatures are projected to continue rising during the 21st century. The processes controlling trophic state and wetland quality are complex and are further complicated by anthropogenic disturbance and climate warming. As a result of cumulative disturbances, wetland ecosystem function and water quality are being degraded. My goal is to examine the effects of climatic/physical and biotic factors on the ecology and nutrient dynamics of northern marshes and shallow open waters in natural and disturbed regions. One component of my research will be to investigate the role of top-down vs. bottom-up control of algal productivity in shallow wetland lakes in the undisturbed western boreal forest and the disturbed boreal transition/aspen parkland regions. Under Alberta's new wetland policies, wetlands facing development will be either protected, developed with modifications, or new wetlands constructed to replace destroyed wetlands. The challenge for wetland managers is determining wetland health in disturbed and restored wetlands because there is no ecosystem evaluation system in Alberta. In other regions, bioassessments have been successful in quantifying degradation and restoration success, but bioassessments are regionally specific. In western Canadian wetlands, the development of wetland health indicators has not been done. I will measure the biotic, chemical and physical factors in natural reference marshes and shallow open lakes and contrast them to disturbed wetlands. Biotic responses of emergent and submersed vegetation, macroinvertebrates, and zooplankton to different chemical and physical conditions will be quantified and developed into specific metrics and indices of wetland health. My research will increase the understanding of ecological processes in shallow wetlands and develop the necessary tools to evaluate wetland health for ecosystem management.",Environnement,Environnement,"Evolution & Ecology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"Electrodialysis (ED), an electrochemical separation process, uses an electric field as the driving force and charged membranes to perform the separation. Despite its strong potential of applications in food, environmental and biotechnology industries, one of the common problems of electromembrane processes is fouling of membranes. Numerous studies have been done on the identification of species causing fouling, but usually directed to anion-exchange membrane (AEM). However, in our works aiming the development of new food and nutraceutical applications of electromembrane processes, we have observed the fouling action of protein and/or mineral present in solution on bipolar and cation-exchange membranes (CEM). Recently, my team was the first to demonstrate the effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) on protein fouling during conventional ED. The pulsed mode consists in applying a hashed current : a constant current density during a fixed time (Ton) followed by a pause duration (Toff). No work, except our preliminary work, aimed specifically the study of ED using PEF on protein fouling. Furthermore, at our knowledge, PEF has never been used during ED with bipolar membrane. The general objective of this research program is to determine the intrinsic conditions of a solution to predispose to the formation of a fouling on membrane used in electromembrane processes. More specifically, the objectives of the proposed research program are 1) to study the solution composition effect on membrane fouling formation, 2) to evaluate the impact of pulsed electric field on membrane fouling, 3) to study the fouling of ion-exchange membranes, 4) to study the kinetic migration of charged species during electromembrane processes and 5) to identify and characterize the fouling nature. This program will generate information innovative on an electrochemical point of view on membrane exchange and relevant for the scale-up of these processes.  At last, the proposed research program will offer an exceptional opportunity for the vocational training of highly qualified staff in a competitive field where success chances are linked to multidisciplinary expertise and innovation capacity.

"Fatty acids make up a large portion of the brain cell membranes.  When released from these membranes (by an enzyme called phospholipase A2) the fatty acids can then help brain cells communicate with each other.  By changing the dietary intake of fatty acids we can change the fatty acid composition of brain cell membranes.  This in turn changes the amount and types of fatty acids that are released from the membranes by phospholipase A2 and thus changes how brain cells communicate with each other.  With the advent of molecular biology we now know there are multiple forms (called isoforms) of phospholipase A2 within the brain.  How these phospholipase A2 isoforms differ in their ability to release specific fatty acids from the membrane is not known.  The overall goal of my research is to identify if the different phospholipase A2 isoforms are selective in the type of fatty acids they release.  By doing so, I am also testing if we can modify the amount of a specific phospholipase A2 isoform by providing more or less of the type of fatty acids it is selective for in the diet.  Scientists have now reported many different conditions where specific phospholipase A2 isoforms are overactive, including Alzheimer's disease and Bipolar disorder.  If we better understand what fatty acids these phospholipases are releasing, we might have a better insight into whether or not diets high or low in certain fatty acids could be beneficial in treating these conditions.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Integrative Animal Biology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"Nanotechnology necessitates the ability to construct very precise nanostructures or nano-objects with well-defined shapes, sizes, and long-range order, as well as specific responsiveness to external stimuli such as light and temperature.  One of the most important methods to achieve this is by the self-assembly of appropriately designed molecules.  This is the approach privileged by nature, giving very complex but exquisitely designed biological structures having highly sophisticated functions. For materials scientists, two types of molecules that self-assemble in specific ways are liquid crystals and block copolymers, giving nano- and meso-structured materials, respectively.  These are thus ideal starting materials for the design of complex man-made nanostructures.  We have previously pioneered in ""marrying"" liquid crystals and polymers through supramolecular chemistry - i.e. by directing the assembly of the two components (building blocks) via specific non-covalent interactions.  This is an extremely versatile approach for tailoring the specific properties of the material for specific purposes, including for the incorporation of stimuli-responsive functions.  We will now combine block copolymers and stimuli-sensitive liquid crystals via the supramolecular approach for the purpose of obtaining novel ""intelligent"" materials with hierarchical structure (i.e. periodicity on several lengthscales, nano and meso) and with specific function associated with one or more of the structural levels.  

In practice, many high-technology applications - ranging from active nanodevices (e.g. high-throughput biosensors) to nanoporous filtration membranes to nanopatterned templates (for depositing other desired materials such as metals, electroactive molecules or biomolecules) - require polymers to be in the form of thin and ultrathin films characterized by specific, well-ordered nanopatterns.  Block copolymers are again ideal for this purpose.  Using the supramolecular approach, we will combine block copolymers with small molecules, including liquid crystalline and stimuli-responsive ones, to learn to direct, fine-tune, and manipulate the patterns obtained and to understand the underlying principles.

"The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) are promising energy conversion devices for applications that range from portable electronics and transportation to stationary electricity generation. Fuel cells that employ hydrogen and oxygen from air are cleaner and more efficient than combustion engines and have the potential to provide higher energy densities than conventional batteries. However, the widespread commercial adoption of fuel cells is currently hindered by prohibitive cost, reliability and durability. In PEMFCs, excess liquid water tends to accumulate in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and gas flow channels, leading to oxidant starvation, material degradation and performance loss. In the SOFC, novel electrode structures are necessary for improvements in reliability and durability.

           Prof. Bazylak will investigate the microscale transport behavior of gaseous and liquid water in the PEMFC in order to develop new materials and material surface treatments for improved water management strategies. In collaboration with Prof. Naguib, Prof. Bazylak will design nanoporous polymer materials for novel GDL materials. Prof. Kesler will investigate the pore size distribution and permeability in SOFC electrodes to evaluate and design newly fabricated materials. 

           In this proposal, we have requested a porometer to measure the material characteristics of porous media employed in the PEMFC and SOFC, including the material pore sizes, gaseous and liquid permeabilities under varying temperatures and compression pressures, both of which affect the performance of fuel cells. We will have the capability to accurately measure material characteristics for numerical modelling input parameters and to isolate the effects of temperature and compression pressure on these material properties. This equipment is critical for evaluating existing and designing new fuel cell materials for improved reliability and durability. With this proposed equipment, our research groups have the potential to revolutionize PEMFC and SOFC technologies to advance the growing Canadian energy sector.

"An estimated 97% of all energy consumed by transportation vehicles is still petroleum based, and combined with society's growing energy demands for not only transportation but also electronic devices, there is an ever increasing need for sustainable energy systems. Fuel cells are cleaner and more efficient than combustion engines and have the potential to provide higher energy densities than conventional batteries. However, fuel cells still face major technical challenges, such as achieving durability and affordability.



Although many developments have been made in fuel cell research, water management still remains one of the largest limitations to performance and lifetime. Improved water management is vital for the widespread adoption of fuel cell technologies. Excess water in the porous transport layers and gas flow channels are common occurrences in the fuel cell, which lead to fuel starvation, material degradation and performance loss. Developing a strong understanding of liquid transport behaviour in the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell will lead to the development of a theoretical framework for multiphase flow in the porous transport layers. These insights can then be used to provide accurate parameters for continuum phase models used to optimize and design the PEM fuel cell. The proposal outlines the challenges facing PEM fuel cell technologies and proposes research that will lead to improved PEM fuel cell designs and performance.



The proposed research will make two important contributions: 1) The development of a theoretical framework for liquid water transport in the porous transport layers of the PEM fuel cell, and 2) the training of highly qualified personnel with expertise needed for Canada's quickly growing fuel cell industry.","Stockage et transformation de l'�nergie","Ressources d'�nergie","Mechanical Engineering - B",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Enzymes are proteins that accelerate (catalyze) biological reactions.  My research focuses on developing a detailed understanding of how enzymes accomplish this acceleration of reactions rates.  Specifically, I am developing a detailed understanding of the interactions that occur between enzymes and the substrate molecules that they act on.  This knowledge is essential to understanding how enzymes work, to engineer synthetic enzyme catalysts, and to design potential inhibitors of enzymes (drugs).  For this purpose, I am studying mandelate racemase.  This enzyme catalyzes the interconversion of D- and L-mandelic acid and plays a role in the metabolism of some soil bacteria.  The enzyme serves as a paradigm for understanding how enzymes catalyze unfavorable reactions (e.g., C-H bond cleavage).  Building on previous work, I will determine how substrate binding changes the acidity of amino acid side chains that reside in the enzyme's catalytic center.  I have discovered that mandelate racemase is inhibited by substrate-product analogues and I will develop this finding further by assessing whether other racemases are also inhibited by substrate-product analogues and whether this is a general strategy for the development of inhibitors of related enzymes that are targets for drug design.  I am also conducting experiments to address the fundamental question of how, over the course of evolution, enzymes lower the energy barrier of a reaction to achieve catalysis.  Finally, I am studying enzymes that function at extremes of temperature.  These so-called extremozymes have many practical applications.  The present proposal addresses fundamental issues in enzymology and evolution, and the results should provide insights into general strategies for inhibitor design which will be useful knowledge for aiding drug development.

"    )	Plants and photosynthetic bacteria harvest light with incredibly high efficiencies and convert light energy to chemical potential energy. Can we benefit from nature's methods in order to generate electrical power? This proposal is to take an interdisciplinary approach to this question. The methods rely on genetic engineering and biochemical separation techniques, along with device modeling and fabrication techniques. 

    )	The creation of new photosynthesis protein variants and development of biochemical methods, in combination with the modeling and fabrication skills has resulted in an opportunity to investigate and exploit the incredible solar to electrical energy conversion capabilities of naturally occurring proteins. 

    )	The specific experiments will utilize proteins that naturally harvest light energy and convert this energy to a flow of electrons. In photosynthesis, this electron flow is immediately tapped in chemical reactions by other proteins in a living cell. In our work we will remove the proteins from the cell, such that the light-driven electron flow is diverted to a fabricated electrode and enters an electrical circuit, where it can be used to power devices. Work by others has shown the feasibility of this approach but currents and voltages have been much smaller than is theoretically possible. In our approach the efficient transfer of electrons from the protein to the electrode will be enhanced by using genetically engineered proteins, whose surface properties are changed in geometrically and chemically precise ways. The net result of using these altered proteins will be much closer and uniform orientation of the electron donor (the protein) to the acceptor (the electrode), and hence greatly improved electrical current.

"The SUNBEAM (Studies to Unlock Northern Basins Energy along Arctic Margins) Program is the University of Calgary's initiative aimed at engaging a team of professors and their students in the study of Canada's most promising frontier basins in the Arctic. The SUNBEAM Program will train a new generation of geoscientists in the many aspects of multi-disciplinary, holistic, basin analysis, while gaining invaluable knowledge directly applicable to assessing and eventually unlocking the energy resource potential of the Arctic islands. In partnership with Total, the SUNBEAM Program will allow a dozen of graduate students to learn how to conduct research in the far north, while giving them access to one of Canada's most remarkable sedimentary successions. It will also introduce a new generation of professors to the challenges and rewards of conducting research in the Arctic. The project will both directly support and complement NRCan's mapping effort in the Arctic islands (Geomapping for Energy and Minerals (GEM)) in focusing on a broad area of the Sverdrup Basin. The SUNBEAM Project will contribute, in harmony with the overall objectives of GEM, to the sustainable economic development of northern Canada, with tangible benefits for all Canadians. A resource-based economy, as promoted by GEM and SUNBEAM, is a condition for creating prosperity, jobs, opportunities and a healthy social fabric in the north. The SUNBEAM Program will also generate a wealth of information on the resource-rich Canadian landmass adjacent to the Polar Continental Shelf that is currently being surveyed for its possible extension under the Law of the Sea.","Ressources d'�nergie (production, exploration, traitement, distribution et utilisation de l'�nergie)","Ressources d'�nergie","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Alberta,Alberta
"The buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, blamed for global warming, has an equally alarming offspring in the oceans: the rapid acidification of marine habitats. The accumulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide is indeed accompanied by an equally large buildup of carbon dioxide in the ocean. Once dissolved, carbon dioxide breaks into a more reactive compound that combines with hydrogen to form carbonic acid. Carbonic acid in the oceans puts enormous pressure on organisms that build a hard calcium carbonate skeleton (for example, corals), many of which exist in microscopic forms and constitute the base of the marine food chain. Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is only 35% above pre-industrial values, and yet ocean acidification is well underway. We will study the response of ancient oceans to a far more significant increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide which occurred between 325 to 250 million years ago when concentrations rose 5 to 10 times the modern values. We will investigate whether it is the associated increase in ocean acidity that contributed to a progressive eradication of calcium carbonate-secreting animals and plants. This phenomenon culminated in the largest mass extinction on Earth, when 95% of hard-shelled organisms had disappeared.

"The pharmaceutical and fine chemical companies are highly interested in new syntheses of nitrogen-containing compounds. In the pharmaceutical companies, over 90% of the compounds tested have at least one nitrogen atom in their structure. As such, new methods can help in drug discovery by providing shorter and more efficient access to these compounds. Fine chemical companies are manufacturing the various chemicals that we take for granted in our everyday life (soaps, surfactants, coatings, etc.) and some of these chemicals possess nitrogen atom(s) in their structure. Surprisingly, the conversion of alkenes and alkynes (cheap petrochemicals or easily accessible starting materials) into nitrogen-containing molecules currently requires several steps and more cost-effective, efficient processes are possible and needed. Our research programme is directed at providing such new tools to the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals companies. This proposed research objective is to develop a new, metal-free, transformation to convert alkenes and alkynes into important classes of molecules bearing at least one nitrogen atom in their structure, such as nitrogen heterocycles, amines and imines. This reactivity is currently not developed enough and as such is rarely utilized to access these valuable products. Our approach is likely to have complementary reaction scope compared to the reactions catalyzed by transition metals, which display limited reactivity and are often costly and/or sensitive to air and moisture. As part of this research, students will undergo training in the area of synthetic organic chemistry and gain experience in catalysis and in the preparation of medicinally important compounds. This type of training is ideally suited for future work in the Canadian pharmaceutical or fine chemical sectors.","Produits pharmaceutiques administrables � l'homme","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"Influenza (flu) is a growing concern for health authorities worldwide. The annual cost of flu illness and the threat of an imminent pandemic make it all the more necessary to better understand the mechanisms that drive this disease.



The objective of this research is to describe and understand how various factors can affect the spread of flu within an individual. This will be done by suggesting hypotheses in the form of mathematical and computer models and seeing how their behaviour compares to that of experimental systems. For example, fitting the models to experimental data will help determine key parameters of an influenza infection like viral production rate which would be difficult or impossible to obtain experimentally.



The research will concentrate on 3 particular aspects of the disease: (1) how anti-influenza drugs act on the various phases of virus reproduction and thus influence viral population growth; (2) how the variety of cell types in the lungs affects how fast the disease spreads in certain parts of the lungs compared to others; and (3) how the chemical signals (chemokines) released by the cells infected with or combating the flu infection are affecting how sick a patient will feel or how quickly she/he will recover.



Answers to these questions will help us get a better understanding of what drives this disease and how we can best combat it. Additionally, the models and approaches that will be used in this research should be applicable to other respiratory diseases such as SARS and the metapneumovirus.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances",Interdisciplinary,2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"Exploration geochemistry involves the collection, transport and analysis of numerous samples of various types (such as soils and vegetation).  Because there are increasing restrictions on the size of samples and most samples are taken to detect deposits at depth, extracting the maximum information from each sample is imperative, thus requiring the development of sensitive techniques.  The goal of this collaborative research effort between the Departments of Chemistry and Geological Sciences at Queen's University and Anglo American plc (AAplc) is to gain an understanding of how metals move up from under-cover ore deposits, so as to enable the design of an efficient geochemical exploration method to locate buried ore deposits.  To this end, several methods will be used, refined or developed to (1) identify and quantify the metal-containing species that are originally present in the sample, (2) identify and quantify the mobile metal-containing species that are released by leaching the sample with water or out-gassed by the sample at ambient temperature, and (3) identify and quantify the metal-containing species that are released by the sample upon heating.  Because available instruments can barely detect several elements of interest, several novel simple strategies will first be implemented to improve their detection capabilities.  The use of samples of known origin, both near and away from various under-cover ore deposits, will enable the identification of unique compounds, suite of elements and specific isotopes that are indicative of these under-cover ore deposits.  This collaboration will benefit Queen's through new basic and applied research directions, operating support for their analytical laboratories, salary support for post-doctoral fellows and students, and publication of basic research results.   AAplc will benefit from new analytical techniques that they can successfully use for more effective geochemical exploration.  Canada will benefit from the simple strategies that can readily be implemented in all government, academic and industrial laboratories to enhance their detection capabilities and, in turn, improve the quality of their results.","Technologie de l'instrumentation","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Ontario,Ontario
"Very little is known about the chemical form and bio-availability of trace elements in foods and airborne particulate matter (APM).  It has been estimated that 4 to 10 billion dollars could be saved in health care costs annually in Canada if nutrient intakes by humans were kept within lower and upper safe levels, and those of toxicants were minimised.  To determine those intakes, robust, sensitive, easy-to-use, precise and rapid methods are needed.  These methods must allow quantitation of the various chemical forms of each element, as well as their bio-accessibility, i.e. the amount dissolved in the gastro-intestinal tract, which is easier to measure than bio-availability (the amount ending up in the blood stream).  In fact, because bio-accessibility is a step in the absorption process, and can only be greater than or equal to bio-availability, it is more easily used for risk assessment purposes.  The principal investigator (PI)'s group recently proposed a simple method to measure bio-accessibility.  It will be refined and combined to other techniques with which the PI is well versed to address several high-priority needs of Health Canada, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.  The PI and her graduate students will develop:

(i)  simpler and more sensitive analytical methods to measure arsenic compounds present in foods, with particular attention being paid to infant foods (as infants are most vulnerable); 

(ii) a method providing better information to evaluators, particularly in Product Safety, for risk assessment relating to a number of bio-availability issues (e.g., testing models for leaching from products containing lead, models of gastro-intestinal tract efficiency for lead absorption under different conditions);

(iii) sensitive and easy to use analytical methods to simultaneously determine micro trace levels of tin, mercury and lead as well as organotins, methyl mercury and organolead species in foods. 

The methods will be kept simple in terms of both implementation and use for wide applicability, especially by Canadian authorities including Health Canada who will collaborate in this research effort.

"Measuring the level of dependence between two variables is of great importance in practice. For example, suppose data are collected on patients receiving heart transplantation. It may be of interest to determine if there is a relationship between age at transplantation and the survival time following the operation. Such measures of association are not easy to estimate in presence of incomplete data. The two most common phenomenons causing incomplete data are censoring and truncation. For instance, an observation is said to be ""right-censored"" if the only information available to us is that its true value is greater than some number c. A variable X is said to be ""left-truncated"" when only individuals whose value of X is greater than some number c are included in the sample (other individuals are completely missed by the data collection process). There exist several other schemes of incomplete data. I intend to develop methods of estimating the dependence between two variables under such settings.



Practitioners often need a mathematical model to describe the relationship between two variables. Once a model has been determined, a natural question can be expressed as follows: ""Is the model adequate or not?"" Several authors have treated this issue, but very few have attempted to tackle this problem in the context of censored data. My intention is to develop goodness-of-fit tests handling censorship.

"Indicator minerals are well known useful exploration tool for diamonds. A range in physical characteristics are used, the most prominent being the mineral chemistry that is used to assess, amongst other things, the fertility of a kimberlite for diamonds. Other branches of the mineral exploration industry do not have the benefit of similarly well-developed indicator minerals technology to aid in search of mineral deposits. In addition, a range of important ore minerals record in their chemical composition information about the geological processes during formation of mineral deposits.



The objective of this project is to determine and document the mineral chemistry of iron oxides (magnetite and hematite) from a range of mineral deposit-types from around the world.  The purposes of the study are to characterize Fe-oxides from each type of deposit, to understand the factors controlling the concentrations of minor and trace elements in iron oxides, and ultimately use the trace element contents in iron oxides as an exploration tool.  Textural and petrographic study will be combined with precise and accurate microprobe and laser-ablation-ICP-MS analysis. Chemical data will be used to construct discriminant criteria and diagrams to provide new mineral exploration technology that will be transferred to the industrial partners. This technology transfer will provide the Canadian mineral exploration industry with a competitive advantage to maintain, and accrue, its worldwide leadership.

"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a physiological process that is part of the life of all organisms. In plants and animals, PCD is essential for normal development and for the removal of damaged or infected cells. Different types of PCD have been described in plant cells in response to developmental cues, pathogen infection or abiotic stresses. One example of PCD may occur on infected leaves at the site of pathogen entry (the so-called ""hypersensitive response"") to limit pathogen spread. This response is generally associated with the induction of a specific disease resistance mechanism in the plants.      

   In this research program, the early events and proteins involved in the activation and regulation of cell death and cell survival pathways will be characterized in the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana. A unique genetic approach will be used to identify key regulators in the control of PCD induced by UV-C irradiation. This information will be useful to understand how cell survival may be favoured in some types of plant defence reactions and could then be applied to the development of symptom-less resistant plants.  

   A second approach studies the PCD-inducing activity of a phytotoxin, thaxtomin A (TA), that is essential for the development of common scab disease of potato. We have shown that TA activates PCD through inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis in Arabidopsis cell suspensions. We will examine the effect of TA in whole plants and characterize the early signals that activate this process of cell death. Moreover, we have produced plant cell suspensions that can grow in the presence of lethal concentrations of TA. Changes in gene expression in these cells will be analysed to determine how these cells can survive to TA. We think this data will lead to the development of plants that are more tolerant to stresses perturbing the plant cell wall, such as TA, wounding and pathogen infection.

"Engineering advances of hardware and software over the last 25 years have made magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indispensable for the diagnosis and improved understanding of many human diseases and disorders. Routine clinical MRI measures signal from the hydrogen nucleus (i.e. proton, 1H) of water and it is unique differences in the water properties of tissue that yields image contrast. However, with the appropriate engineering, MRI can acquire signal from a different nucleus, namely the naturally abundant sodium (23Na) ion within the body. Sodium is linked directly to proper cell function, and may provide evidence of tissue injury despite normal appearance on conventional MRI. Sodium MRI is inherently very challenging because of low sensitivity due to sodium's low concentration in tissue and complicated physics responses. Therefore, sodium MRI is a non-standard imaging technique not available on most clinical 1.5T (i.e. strength of the magnetic field) MRI scanners because of the lack of appropriate electronics and specialized imaging pulse sequences. Imaging is more sensitive if the MRI scanner has a very strong magnetic field. This proposal will take advantage of a very strong ""triple strength"" MRI scanner (4.7T) located at the University of Alberta.



The goal of this technical grant is to develop the hardware and software for sodium MRI of cartilage in the knee as sodium concentration is directly linked with cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis, a debilitating condition which affects millions of Canadians. On the other hand, current standard MRI of water is not specific to cartilage damage. Imaging the sodium ion in the knee will require us to design, build in-house, and test new MRI electronic components (i.e. radiofrequency coils). Computer simulations will be used to predict the parameters that will yield the best signal-to-noise ratio given a desired image resolution and scan duration. Once we engineer, optimize, and test our novel MRI scans on healthy people, the noninvasive assessment of sodium in cartilage could be applied in the future to people with osteoarthritis of the knee.

"The pork industry is a major contributor to the Canadian agriculture economy, with an estimated farm gate income of about $3.5 billion per year. The Canadian meat processing industry has annual sales of almost $15 billion, about 40% of which is pork. Clearly, a successful pork industry is important to the overall Canadian economy. In addition, 50% of Canada's pork is exported to more than 90 nations worldwide, so it is essential that our industry remains financially competitive, produces a high quality product and maintains environment sustainability. The objective of this project is to develop an innovative and simple method for the determination of true sulphur amino acid requirements and bioavailability. Our approach is based on the broadly accepted understanding of sulphur amino acid metabolism, namely that sulphur amino acids supplied by the diet and absorbed in amounts that exceed the requirement for growth will be excreted in the urine as fre sulphate or related compounds. At the end of this project, we will provide a new approach for the determination of true sulphur amino acid requirement and bioavailability, and a method that probably could be used to determine the true amino acid requirements and availability of other amino acids by using urinary sulphate as an indicator. The concepts behind this proposed method are well established in humans and rats, s the likelihood of success is very good. Improved methods for the determination of true amino acid bioavailability has the potential to benefit Canada by providing an improved platform for the formulation of optimum feeding programs; this, in turn, will assist the pork industry in achieving the highest quality pork at the lowest possible cost, through optimum dietary amino acid content. Avoiding over formulation of amino acids will also contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing nitrogen excretion, a common outcome when diets are improperly formulated.

"The average diameter of human hair is roughly 50 micrometers (50E-6 m).  In units of human hair, micro-cantilever sensors are rectangular shaped levers approximately 1 hair wide, 4 hairs long and 0.2 hairs thick. These sensors can be incredibly sensitive to chemical and physical phenomena with sensitivities in the nanogram (10E-9 g), picoliter (10E-12 l), femtojoule (10E-15 J), and attomolar (10E-18 M)) with millisecond response time.  Their small size and sensitivity combined with today's micromachining techniques makes cantilever sensors a promising technology for many medical applications.  



If cantilever sensors are so effective then why haven't they been implemented into commercial products?  At this point in time cantilever sensors do not offer the reliability and reproducibility required for commercial use.  Where many of the applications of cantilever sensors are in the medical field, it is imperative that these sensors meet the highest quality requirements.  Therefore the initial goal of my research program at Memorial University will be to understand all factors that affect the reliability and reproducibility of cantilever sensors in order to transform them from proof-of-purpose devices into a commercial technology.   



Once this is done we will use cantilever sensors to detect various strains of the influenza virus and incorporate them into portable atmospheric testing instruments.  These types of devices could then be used to perform constant air monitoring in places such as airplanes, airport and train terminals, and other public spaces such as schools and shopping malls.

Dans une optique de traitement de cette maladie, pour environ la moiti� des cas, la radioth�rapie sera utilis�e comme arme th�rapeutique dans une phase ou l'autre du traitement. Dans cette optique, le nombre total de cas ayant recours � la radioth�rapie continuera de conna�tre une augmentation. L'augmentation de l'efficacit� des traitements de radioth�rapie, se traduisant par un meilleur contr�le tumoral ou un traitement ayant moins d'effets secondaires, ou encore mieux les deux � la fois dans certains cas, est intimement li�e � une augmentation des connaissances scientifiques et technologiques.



L'objectif � long terme du pr�sent programme de recherche est d'augmenter la pr�cision dans les traitements du cancer par radiation et, pour certaines applications, la pr�cision en imagerie m�dicale via le traitement de l'image. Pour atteindre cet objectif, le programme de recherche tourne autour de 3 axes compl�mentaires soit la conception: (1) de nouveaux algorithmes d'optimisation des traitements, (2) d'algorithmes de traitement de l'image et (3) de nouvelles techniques de d�tection de la radiation. Bien que les applications �ventuelles du programme de recherche propos� soient ultimement dans le domaine m�dical, la r�alisation m�me des objectifs se base sur le d�veloppement des connaissances des domaines scientifiques traditionnels. Ces domaines sont la physique m�dicale, la physique nucl�aire, le g�nie biom�dical, l'optimisation num�rique et les sciences de l'image.

"G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) represents the most important family of cell surface receptors involved in the regulation of neurotransmission.  GPCRs are believed to regulate cell signaling trough activation of heterotrimeric G proteins.  However, GPCRs have also been shown to exert their action through the formation of signaling complexes (signalomes) composed of signaling molecules and the scaffolding proteins beta-arrestins.  We recently demonstrated that such a beta-arrestin signalome mediates some effects of dopamine receptor in vivo.  Disruption of this complex in the mouse striatum results in a loss of regulation of signaling molecules Akt and GSK3 by dopamine and in reduced behavioral responses to dopaminergic drugs in mice lacking beta arrestin 2.  The proposed research protocol has for objectives to examine further the regulation of Akt and GSK3 by beta-arrestin signaling complexes and to identify other neurotransmitter/receptor systems regulating the formation of beta-arrestin signaling complexes.  This research will involve the use of different GPCR responding to neurotransmitters to evaluate the involvement of these receptors on the formation of beta-arrestin signaling complexes.  Subsequently the physiological relevance of these findings will be evaluated in vivo using beta arrestin knockout mice.  Beta-arrestin mediated signaling by GPCR may represent a general new mechanism of neurotransmission and a better understanding of its mechanism and in vivo relevance may lead to a better understanding of basic neurobiological processes such as neurodevelopment and the normal functions of the adult mammalian brain.

"Wireless communications research has been given great impetus by the advent of cellular telephony, mobile satellite and portable personal communication services.  The exponentially growing user demand for services, together with the increasing demands for higher speed transmission of large amounts of data, as well as customer requests for multi-media services, create the need for new technologies.  In order to provide higher data transmission rates to more users without sacrificing the integrity of the received information, advances must be made in the transmission system designs and in the transmission system components.  In turn, achieving the best advances in wireless systems and components requires better estimation of the wireless channels in practical systems, and better modelling of the wireless channels in engineering design studies.

The overall goal of the proposed research is higher capacity in broadband wireless communication systems at lower cost.  We want to offer more wireless services with higher quality to more users.  This is a significant challenge, scientifically and technologically, because the wireless spectrum (bandwidth) is a fixed resource, and the new wireless services, for example video cellphones, which are becoming increasingly popular require much bandwidth.  The primary thrust of this research is investigation into fundamental properties, limitations, and improvements in broadband wireless systems.  Without new discoveries in engineering science, the available spectrum will become overloaded and unable to provide wireless services to the anticipated number of future users.  A secondary thrust is the application of the research results to present and future systems.  New engineering science must be put into action in the development of new technologies for real world systems.  The field will benefit from new theories which provide insight into both scientific understanding and practical applications.  The average person, the user, will benefit by having more and improved wireless services.  Canada will benefit because leading-edge wireless technologies will be transferred to Canadian industries impacting product sales and job creation.

"Our research concerns lithospheric tectonic processes and the interactions among the lithosphere, the underlying convecting mantle, and overlying hydrosphere and atmosphere. The lithosphere, the Earth's strong outer layer, is central to the plate tectonic view of the Earth. Contrary to early plate tectonic concepts lithospheric plates are not rigid. Although plate boundaries are where most deformation occurs, continental interiors in particular experience significant deformation. Our research is motivated by the need for a quantitative understanding of the deformation of the lithosphere and its surficial sedimentary cover. The goal is to determine how such geodynamical processes contribute to the geological record.

  Our scientific approach to these problems is to develop and use numerical geodynamical models (primarily finite element models) as analogues to natural systems. The model experiments combine basic underlying processes in a framework in which the sensitivity of the model results to a range of hypotheses/propositions is examined. The results are then compared with observations from natural systems. The ability to compute self-consistent model evolutions under controlled conditions (as in sensitivity analyses) leads to insight into the controls of the model dynamics. The novelty of this approach is that complex systems can be simplified by isolating the key driving processes and their interactions, thereby leading to hypotheses concerning the operation of equivalent natural systems.

  We report progress and propose new research on the following problems: 1) Lithospheric scale convergent tectonics; 2) Lithospheric extension and the formation of rifted continental margins; 3) Continental margin salt and shale tectonics, and; 4) Thin-skinned thrust-and-fold belts. We also describe progress in: 5) Development of new techniques (coupling of mechanical deformation and Darcy fluid flow in porous sediments and crust, and collaborative research on the development of 3D finite element software).

"Following a spinal cord lesion, a significant number of axonal connections across the lesion site are altered or lost. Therefore, the central nervous system has to ""relearn"" how to use the locomotor system by using the undamaged and regenerated neurons.

The main idea of this project is to determine which neuronal descending tracts originating above the spinal cord lesion are involved in the induction and maintenance of locomotion. Secondly, describing the plasticity that occurs in this altered nervous system with training. The methodological aspects of this research are oriented towards the electrical properties of neuronal signalling and a new technique recently developed in my laboratory, the optical imaging. The latter was developed in collaboration with Dr. F. Lesage, an engineer from the Polytechnique in Montreal. Compare to the electrophysiological recordings, the optical imaging allows us to determine precisely which population of neurons are activated in the entire portion of the lumbar spinal cord simultaneously. This project is novel and important, since it will allow us to examine the excitation in the lumbar spinal cord in terms of rostro-caudal activation. Imaging will be paired with field potential (FP) and those neuronal models will be correlated with the open field locomotor pattern of the animals using kinematics approach.

"Although Arctic and Northern waters support a significant diversity of productive marine ecosystems, the impact of climate warming on its biotic components is poorly known. Marine top predators represent reliable indicators of short- and long- term changes in marine food-webs and resource availability, thus providing insights into ecological aspects of lower trophic levels. During the next three years, my students and I will contribute to predict how environmental characteristics (population density, resource availability) and interindividual differences (behaviour, physiology) may affect life history traits (growth, survival, breeding performance) in marine mammal populations. The equipment requested here will significantly contribute to fulfill the objectives of my research program, as it represents the basic necessary material to implement a long-term individual capture-mark-recapture study in a marine mammal population, here the St-Lawrence estuarine harbour seals. The freeze branding kit is an absolute requirement because such permanent marking system permits to identify individual seals from a distance throughout their life, therefore enhancing the recapture probability of individuals without catching or disturbing them. The stomach temperature pills and archival time-depth-recorders are crucial to provide a complete insight of the pup energetic allocation during lactation. By allowing the disentanglement of behavioural and environmental factors, these electronic devices will determine the preweaning factors influencing the individual postweaning survival, a key factor for subsequent population status. All the requested equipment will be used on a daily basis by my whole research team (1 PhD, 3 MSc, 3 undergraduates) during four months per year, and the data subsequently processed and analysed throughout the year by my graduate students . Finally, the life duration of such equipment goes well beyond an operating grant, which will undoubtedly contribute to reinforce the implementation of my long-term research activities.

"Although Arctic and Northern waters support a significant diversity of productive marine ecosystems, the impact of climate warming on its biotic components is poorly known. Marine top predators represent reliable indicators of short- and long- term changes in marine food-webs and resource availability, thus providing useful insights into ecological aspects of lower trophic levels. During the next five years, my students and I will contribute to predict how environmental characteristics (population density, habitat quality, resource availability) and interindividual differences (behaviour, physiology) may affect life history traits (growth, survival, reproduction) in marine mammal populations. In order to fulfill these objectives, this program will set up and develop a long-term individual capture-mark-recapture study of a marine mammal population, here the Saint Lawrence estuarine harbour seals. Through the combined studies of individual ecological characteristics (foraging strategies, diet composition) and population ecology (population status, density & age structure), we will determine the important phenotypic characteristics of parents on offspring survival and ultimately individual fitness. Hence, we will investigate how individual response to environmental change may ultimately shape population structure. This research program will lead to further understand the adaptive strategies of marine predators to spatial and temporal variability of resources and the consequences in terms of population dynamics. Such understanding of the mechanisms involved in life-history strategies is crucial for the monitoring and conservation of wild marine populations, especially when it relates to predicting the impact of environmental change on polar marine ecosystems over an extended period. The proposed research will involve one PhD, three MSc and five BSc students. These students will be trained in the field with regard to proper capture, handling and sampling techniques of wild seals, as well as documenting and interpreting ecological and individual variation within a population from a holistic point of view.","Oc�ans, mers et estuaires",Environnement,"Evolution & Ecology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Enzymes are becoming increasingly important products for several industries.  They are safe for the environment, cheaper than ever, and, when used under optimal conditions, much more efficient than chemical catalysts.  With recent advances in protein engineering and directed evolution, customized enzymes will become available for industrial processes for which the native enzymes were unsuitable.  At the heart of enzyme efficacy as industrial biocatalysts are stability issues.  Indeed, enzymes have to stand rather harsh conditions in order to provide economical alternatives to polluting chemicals; customizing enzymes for industrial application will therefore require an in-depth understanding of stability determinants in proteins.  



In continuity with our ongoing research programme, we intend to shed light on the structural features that determine enzyme behavior, particularly enzyme stability.  To this end, we will use a hydrolase (endopolygalacturonase) as a model enzyme because of its simplicity and because of its multiple potential applications in various industries.  By a judicious choice of mutations or by random mutagenesis, we will attempt to modulate the response of this enzyme to pH, temperature and other destabilizing conditions.  Spectroscopic and enzymatic methods will be used to characterize the impact of amino acid replacement on selected properties.  By comparing enzyme properties before and after modification, we will provide a level of understanding that will then be useful in designing strategies for optimizing enzyme as industrial biocatalysts.

"Several lines of evidence indicate that a chronic inability to self-regulate negative emotions, such as sadness and fear, may play a pivotal role in the genesis of clinical depression and anxiety disorders. There is also some evidence that impulsive aggression and violence arise as a consequence of defective regulation of anger. To date no neuroimaging study has examined the impact of mindfulness - a mental state in which moment-to-moment awareness of changing objects of perception (e.g., feeling states, bodily states, etc.) is cultivated - on the activity of the neural systems supporting emotional self-regulation. Given the scientific data demonstrating the benefits of mindfulness practice with respect to the regulation of negative emotional states, we propose in this application to conduct a number of fMRI studies about the effects of mindfulness on the neural systems underlying emotional self-regulation. We plan to examine the functional connectivity, effective connectivity, and spatiotemporal dynamics of the neural circuits supporting conscious and voluntary regulation of emotion. The results of the proposed experiments will significantly increase our knowledge and understanding of the functional and effective connectivity as well as spatiotemporal dynamics of the neural circuits and systems underlying emotional self-regulation. In addition, since several forms of psychopathology result from failures to adaptively self-regulate emotional responses, with outcomes ranging from personal malaise to socially maladjusted and destructive behaviours, the results of the proposed experiments may shed light on the neural mechanisms of these disorders.

"Residential buildings account for 17% of energy consumption and 16% of GHG emissions in Canada.  The GHG emissions associated with providing energy services in residential buildings rose by 15% from 1990 to 2003, partly due to the increase in house size and the growing use of air-conditioning.



The long-term objective of this research program is to mitigate these trends by discovering innovative approaches and concepts that can lead to new technologies and practices that reduce the energy consumption and GHG emissions associated with providing energy services in residential buildings.  Efforts will be focused on two research areas over the time period covered by the current grant application:

1) The small-scale cogeneration of heat and electricity (micro-cogeneration) including synergies with renewable energy sources.

2) Alternative cooling approaches including those based upon solar energy and those coupled to micro-cogeneration.



These innovative concepts will be explored through modelling and simulation supported with fundamental experimental investigations.  The research will build upon the proponent's past and ongoing work on micro-cogeneration and whole-building performance simulation.



In addition to generating new fundamental knowledge of these innovative energy systems, it is expected that this work will also lead to proposed solutions to governments, energy utilities, and industry for significantly reducing GHG emissions and for avoiding major investments in central electricity generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.

"The hippocampus is a crucial brain structure for spatial cognition (among other things), in reptiles, birds and mammals. However, after many decades of research, its precise role is still the subject of considerable controversy. Our lab has been investigating the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory and navigation using a variety of techniques, including computational (neural network) modelling and human memory experiments in virtual reality (VR) environments. We are beginning to understand the conditions under which people rely on cognitive maps, and the cues they draw upon to form those maps. The proposed research will further our understanding of these processes.  Our computational models of the hippocampal memory system will be extended to take into account the fact that people use multiple strategies for navigation. While some people tend to favor a cognitive map strategy, others favor a landmark strategy, based more on motor memory than spatial memory (e.g. ""turn left at the supermarket""). Our models will help to shed light on the neural mechanisms that may subserve these complex functions. Complementing this theoretical work, experimental methods will be used to test predictions of the model and shed further light on the conditions governing the use of cognitive maps. Our past research indicates that objects at navigationally relevant locations such as major intersections in a virtual town tend to be remembered better than other objects on tests of spatial memory, even though other objects are remembered equally well on tests of recognition memory. If objects are encoded as part of a cognitive map, rather than simply being remembered as part of  ""visual snapshots"" or motor memories, people should be able to reliably locate these objects when tested from a range of unfamiliar viewpoints. Moreover, they should be able to remember the locations of objects after long delays, as opposed to relying upon spatial working memory and mental imagery. In the long term, our work could have important implications not only for understanding the basic mechanisms underlying spatial cognition, but for rehabilitating individuals with spatial memory and navigation deficits, as are common with ageing.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"The groundwater in the Lower Fraser River Delta surface aquifer contains high concentrations of iron and other species that are not compatible with dissolved oxygen. Much of this groundwater discharges from the aquifer into the base of Fraser River through the so-called hyporheic zone, the zone of the subsurface where river water and groundwater mix. This mixing is driven in part by the tidal action of the Fraser River. In the hyporheic zone, the oxygen in the Fraser River water is expected to cause the iron in the groundwater to oxidize and form low-solubility iron-oxide (rust-like) precipitates, which are known to adsorb trace metals from the water.  The objective of this research is to study the physical and geochemical processes that occur in the hyporheic zone, and to study the processes that by which the groundwater in the Fraser River Delta aquifers acquire their dissolved loads. The research is important because the geochemical processes in the hyporheic zone and the Fraser River Delta surface aquifer can have a strong effect on contaminants in groundwater and nutrient loading to surface waters.

"Random walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithms, an important class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, are methods to generate data from highly complex probability distributions (the target distribution). Researchers and practitioners in various fields of applications such as biostatistics, computer science, physics, finance, and applied statistics extensively use such methods. In applying RWM algorithms, it is necessary to choose a proposal density; due to its accessibility, the normal density is the most popular choice. The variance of this distribution must be selected carefully in order to have some level of optimality in the performance of the algorithm; this is called the optimal scaling problem. Results about this issue are available in the literature for high-dimensional target distributions with independent components.



My goal is to provide users with more efficient algorithms for less restrictive models (i.e., target models actually arising in practice). One way of achieving this is to study the optimal scaling problem for target distributions whose components admit a nontrivial correlation structure; specifically, I propose to study hierarchical models, which are omnipresent in Bayesian statistics and as such often arise in biostatistics. There also exist many variations of the RWM algorithm that work well in practice, but that have not been studied theoretically. One of them is the Multiple-Try Metropolis algorithm, which generates several ""trial"" proposed moves at every step. I would like to study the weak convergence and optimal scaling theory of such variations. Finally, I intend to propose an algorithm specifically adapted for sampling from the usually problematic bimodal target densities.



I shall also study some applications of MCMC algorithms, notably in engineering (in a problem related to air traffic control).

"CONTEXT: GPS, web mapping, satellite imagery and other geomatics technologies have evolved tremendously over the last ten years. Geospatial data and technologies have become mass-market products while new advanced technologies proliferate (ex. real-time centimetre-level GPS RTK positioning, 3D airborne LIDAR terrain modelling, land-based 3D laser scanning, sensors networks or GNSS-based smart total stations). We are entering an era of ubiquitous geospatial information and massive amounts of heterogeneous data. CHALLENGE: Typical users take digital data for granted, assuming their quality is high and fits the intended usage. This attitude increasingly leads to mistakes since digital data contain uncertainty, their characteristics vary geographically and the needs differ. Many subtleties in spatial referencing methods, measurement techniques, technologies and database design end up being hidden in the data and may lead to results not fitting an intended use. The common practice of providing metadata has proven to be insufficient. As a result of the increasing number of accidents and Court decisions regarding spatial data quality problems, our Society becomes more sensitive to properly warn users about the quality of spatial data with regards to their usages. My OBJECTIVE is to reduce the risks of misuse of geospatial data by improving database design methods. The EXPECTED RESULT is called ""CAREFUL"" (Computer-Assisted Risk Evaluation For Usage Limitations), a formal extension to spatial database design methods. CAREFUL will be a prevention mechanism amenable to a computer-assisted modeling tool capable of automatic warnings code generation. My APPROACH integrates concepts from geomatics engineering, software engineering, risk management and deontology.

"CONTEXT: GPS, web mapping, satellite imagery and other geomatics technologies have evolved tremendously over the last ten years. Geospatial data and technologies have become mass-market products while new advanced technologies proliferate (ex. real-time centimetre-level GPS RTK positioning, 3D airborne LIDAR terrain modelling, land-based 3D laser scanning, sensors networks or GNSS-based smart total stations). We are entering an era of ubiquitous geospatial information and massive amounts of heterogeneous data. CHALLENGE: Typical users take digital data for granted, assuming their quality is high and fits the intended usage. This attitude increasingly leads to mistakes since digital data contain uncertainty, their characteristics vary geographically and the needs differ. Many subtleties in spatial referencing methods, measurement techniques, technologies and database design end up being hidden in the data and may lead to results not fitting an intended use. The common practice of providing metadata has proven to be insufficient. As a result of the increasing number of accidents and Court decisions regarding spatial data quality problems, our Society becomes more sensitive to properly warn users about the quality of spatial data with regards to their usages. My OBJECTIVE is to reduce the risks of misuse of geospatial data by improving database design methods. The EXPECTED RESULT is called ""CAREFUL"" (Computer-Assisted Risk Evaluation For Usage Limitations), a formal extension to spatial database design methods. CAREFUL will be a prevention mechanism amenable to a computer-assisted modeling tool capable of automatic warnings code generation. My APPROACH integrates concepts from geomatics engineering, software engineering, risk management and deontology. Prototypes will use Perceptory, a UML-based tool for modeling and code generation, and will include quality-related standards (ISO 191XX, ISO 3864-2, ANSI X535.4). Tests will involve our industrial partners. INNOVATION will come in term of firsts (method, tool) and as a new solution to help engineers, scientists and the public reduce the risks of spatial data misuse, potentially saving costs, court battles and lives.

"A multipurpose multiplate reader is an extremely versatile and heavily-utilized research instrument. In molecular research, the capacity to analyze large numbers of samples quickly and accurately is critical. Not only does this instrument allow this, but its flexibility (spectrophotometer/fluorometer/luminometer) allows many different types of analyses to be possible. An additional benefit is that the sensitivity of this system allows small volumes to be used, as compared to older technologies. This can significantly reduce the overall costs of an experiment which often use expensive molecular and fine chemical reagents. The multidetector multiplate reader can be used to measure enzyme activity, gene expression (green fluorescent protein- or lux-fusions) or metabolite levels in a microplate format that allows 96 or 386-samples to be analyzed. This instrument will be routinely used by a number of research groups at McGill University who study different biological systems to understand how metabolic flux shifts under stress or other conditions. Bede's laboratory will use this instrument to measure cellular changes in plants in response to caterpillar herbivory and to assess the impact of plant nutritional quality on caterpillar physiological processes. By understanding this interaction, this research will lead to strategies for plant protection against insect herbivores. Driscoll's group investigates legume-rhizobia symbiosis involved in the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, an agricultural area which may minimize the need for fertilizer inputs. His research focuses on the regulation of enzymes involved in carbon metabolism. Access to this instrument will allow him to measure gene expression and activity of key enzymes. This instrument will be used to measure microbial colony growth by Chernier and Whyte's laboratories. Measuring metabolite levels and/or enzyme activity will allow Whyte's lab to understand how microbial extremophiles are adapted to their environments to potentially adopt these strategies for industrial purposes. Therefore, access to this instrument can be used for a diversity of research programs with goals to increase agricultural efficiency and/or industrial applications.

"Agricultural crops provide food, forages and/or biofuels and may help to mitigate greenhouse gasses by acting as carbon sinks. Remarkably, sessile plants are subject to an vast and diverse arsenal of pests and diseases but manage to circumvent most of these onslaughts. However, when a plant is susceptible to a pest or pathogen, this can result in billions of dollars in damage. Understanding how plants co-ordinate and regulate their defense responses at the transcriptional, protein and metabolite levels is key to developing effective plant protection strategies, through breeding or metabolic engineering, that will lead to sustainable agricultural practices. Global cellular master regulators, which co-ordinate multiple pathways and are involved in controlling the endogenous plant defense response, provide a great opportunity to understand plant cellular regulation and provide tools to improve plant protection.

"As for most vertebrates, reproduction in birds is controlled by the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis and each component secretes specific factors and hormones. Until recently, it was believed that this axis was exclusively under stimulatory control with an increase in day length stimulating the release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, followed by luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone secretion by the pituitary gland. However, recently the discovery of a novel inhibitory hypothalamic peptide (gonadotropin inhibitory hormone or GnIH) challenged this existing dogma. Nonetheless, the exact molecular mechanisms involved in GnIH action are still unknown and, the proposed research aims at elucidating its effects at every level of the axis. Within the hypothalamus, I propose to determine the factors controlling GnIH expression around sexual maturation. At the pituitary level, I will determine how gonadotropes integrate and react to stimulatory (via GnRH) and inhibitory (via GnIH) inputs. Furthermore, the effect of this dual control on pituitary function will be clarified. At a gonadal level, I propose to examine possible autocrine/paracrine actions of GnIH on testicular development and function. Based on data we accumulated over the years, I have developed a model summarizing molecular events occurring around sexual maturations in chickens. Results from this study will help verify this model, and could be extrapolated to improve reproduction efficiency in poultry farming as well as designing new therapeutic strategies to control reproduction in wild and pet birds.

"Cathepsin B (CatB), a cysteine protease, is known to be associated with numerous pathological conditions of the central nervous system (CNS), including brain tumours (e.g. gliomas) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In gliomas, CatB plays a major role in tumour invasion through degradation of the extracellular matrix. As such, a large number of CatB inhibitors are actively being developed as anti-cancer agents, including targeted therapies based on enzyme-activated prodrug strategies. In AD, CatB is thought to play anti-amyloidogenic and neuroprotective functions. As such, pharmacological agents which increase the expression of CatB have the potential to counteract AD neuropathology. In both glioma and AD, measuring the expression and/or activity of CatB is crucial for the proper assessment the therapeutic efficacy of new agents. While traditional measures of changes in enzyme expression/activity in response to therapeutic intervention, such as enzyme histochemistry and immunohistochemistry on tissue sections, are feasible for animal models, these methods are not practical in human subjects. As such, methods to monitor enzyme expression/activity in a non-invasive fashion are required.  In this proposal, we plan to develop novel CatB-activated molecular MRI probes and to subsequently evaluate these probes in rodent models of glioma and AD. This proposed project is truly multi-disciplinary and will seamlessly combine the expertise from Dr. Scott Bohle's lab (McGill Department of Chemistry) for the design, synthesis, and chemical characterization of the probes, Dr. Edith Hamel's lab (Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute/McGill University) for the ex vivo evaluation of probe activity as well as in vivo evaluation in mouse models of AD, and Dr. Barry Bedell's lab (Small Animal Imaging Lab, Montreal Neurological Institute/McGill University) for the development of MRI techniques for CatB probe evaluation in rodent models of glioma and AD.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel",2,"CHRPJ ","Collaborative Health Research Projects","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"Cell-cell adhesion is an important mechanism by which the creation of multi-cellular structures in a higher ordered organism and intercellular communication is achieved.  Transmembrane adhesion molecules facilitate these connections, through either homophilic (same proteins) or heterophilic (different proteins) extracellular interactions.  In addition, they link adhesion structures to intracellular signaling pathways and the actin cytoskeleton in order to coordinate associated cellular responses.  Adhesion molecules in many cases also have an important role in directing the migration of cells towards one another, a process that precedes adhesion and the formation of cell-cell contacts. 

In the nervous system a number of adhesion molecules have been localized to synapses: specific sites of cell-cell contact specialized to mediate neuronal communication between one neuron and another.  These include the heterophilic neurexin and neuroligin complex.  Synapses arise during development by a three-step process; the guidance of axons (the signal production side of a synapse) towards their dendritic targets (the signal reception side of a synapse), recognition and cell adhesion between the axon and dendrite and finally stabilization of the synapse.  

In addition to their synaptic localization some neurexin and neuroligin family proteins are also found on axon growth cones and are expressed early during neuronal development prior to synapse formation.  It is presently unknown however what role these proteins have during development, specifically in the processes preceding synapse formation, such as axon outgrowth which involves the production of neuritis via the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton.  This grant proposal will therefore address the hypothesis that Neurexin and Neuroligin family proteins regulate neurite outgrowth by inducing actin cytoskeletal changes.  We will use a cell model system of neurite outgrowth to examine the role of neurexin and neuroligin proteins in this process.  Furthermore we will investigate the mechanisms and signals that are activated inside cells by these proteins.

"The ""Ornamental Wood Working System"" (OWWS) is being developed to address the needs of both the home hobbyist and the professional ornamental wood worker for an automated wood working system using the novel approach of coupling a low cost CNC machine with easy to use web based modelling and tool path planning software. With this system, the user can start designing and machining complex parts as soon as they finish assembling their machine. The OWWS is designed so that geometric models available can be continually upgraded to offer newer design features and more efficient machining methods.   

How does it work? The user interacts with the web based modelling interface to design the base shape of a leg or column and than adds features such as braids, helices, lettering etc. to the base shape. These features are instanced using the web based modelling interface. The designed part can be viewed and, if satisfactory, the tool path can be produced. The tool paths are then downloaded to the user's machine for the actual making of the part. The CNC machine can be used to run tool paths produced via other methods as well. 

To further aid the wood workers this project aims at developing a 5-axis machine with two additional axes that is integrated into the wood working system for the creation of intricate carvings. Control of this machine will utilize innovative approaches for tool positioning. The use of the 5-axis CNC milling lathe is not limited to wood working applicaitons. The machine is expected to be suitable for manufacturing of plastic shoe lasts that have been personalized to a person's foot. Tn this application the tool path is generated based on the model supplied.

Canada is rich is forest resources. The OWWS enables ordinary Canadians to develop value added wood products and create artistic artefacts with commercial value in home building, furniture design and art. Introduction of such a system will open new markets to our Canadian talent.

"Anthelmintic drugs are an essential component of livestock production throughout the world although rising resistance poses a serious threat to their use. Detailing specific molecular changes that cause resistance can be used to find effective alternatives. Many anthelmintics target ligand-gated ion-channels (LGIC) in nematode neuromusculature and can be used to probe basic biology of the nematode nervous system, providing insight into nerve impulse transmission in general. To be relevant in the field we also need to understand mechanisms by which resistance evolves and spreads and so devise more effective drug application and animal management programs. Genome projects for 11 nematode parasites will be completed within 10 years, opening new analysis techniques. To make effective use of these we must understand parasite genetics. My research program is to determine specific mechanisms of resistance at the molecular level and characterize parasite genetics to understand the evolution of resistance. I previously identified two LGICs altered in macrocyclic lactone resistant Haemonchus contortus, a widespread model parasite of sheep and goats. Their expression pattern and pharmacology explain the physiological effects of the drug and changes in the resistant forms alter the parasite response to drug exposure in vivo. I have identified about 85 LGIC genes in the partial genome sequence of H. contortus and full or partial cDNAs are known for 30 of these. For the first part of my research program I propose to further characterize functional changes in macrocyclic lactone resistant LGICs and isolate the remaining LGICs from H. contortus. The function of specific LGICs linked with resistance to levamisole and the newly reported amido acetonitrile anthelmintics will be examined. For the second I propose to determine how genes act in combination to effect resistance and to characterize genetic linkage between genes. This will provide information on the function of LGICs in general and specific changes that cause macrocyclic lactone resistance; extend our knowledge of an important pathogen of livestock and possibly identify new drug targets; lay a foundation for LGIC research and the post-genomic era analysis of resistance in H. contortus.

"The escalating social and personal burdens of mental illnesses and CVDs on health and productivity are staggering. CVD remains the largest killer in the western world, mental illness accounts for 15% of the entire disease burden- an impact greater than the sum of all cancers.  While 2% of Canadians between 60-74 years of age suffer from Alzheimer's and related dementias, one in three Canadians over the age of 85 are afflicted. By 2011, the number of new dementia cases per year will rise to 111,000 and by 2025 over one million Canadians are expected to suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affects approximately 100,000 Canadians, costs the Canadian health care system approximately $2.5B annually, in addition to the tremendous toll on patients and their families. As the baby boomers age, the disproportionate number of dementia cases and CVDs will create a 'tsunami' that will threaten our medical system in the years to come.



The long term vision of my research program is to develop new methods for quantifying anatomical structure and function. I am proposing novel methods to quantify anatomy in the living human brain from 3D magnetic resonance images for applications in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. I am also proposing new methods to study the development of the heart in animal models and quantifying structure in cardiovascular diseases. The ultimate goal is to build anatomical and functional non-invasive biomarkers to detect subtle changes in anatomical shape or function indicative of pathologies, and thereby lead to the early and reliable detection of these pathologies. These methods are also likely to be useful in basic neuroscience, to quantify the relationship between anatomical structure and function.

"Soft tissue motion creates artefact when measuring the skeleton kinematics using skin markers due to muscle contractions or wobbling masses after impacts. However these movements highlight a non-negligible part of the body dynamics. The program of research aims at modelling the soft tissue dynamics based on measured skin-marker displacements. We hypothesize that the skeleton kinematics of the lower-limbs can be accurately estimated from markers put only on the foot, pelvis and anteriomedial tibial side because of the lack of thick soft tissues. Markers put on the thigh and posterior side of the leg are used to model the soft tissue kinematics. 

   [1] Our approach involves various movements for determining the skeleton geometry and optimization procedures to calculate the skeleton kinematics using a redundant marker set. The accuracy and precision of this non-invasive method is quantified by comparison with 3d imagery.  [2] Kinematics of movements with various soft tissue motions (e.g. cycling, landing and walking) are collected to test the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm and to create a database for modelling the soft tissue dynamics.  [3] The displacements of the skin markers with respect to underlying bone are estimated and markers are grouped in clusters that define independent soft tissue. Since the markers are orderly placed on the skin, we expect to determine common marker locations for different subjects and daily-life movements.  [4] Different models will be developed to calculate the dynamics of the soft tissue: functions of joint angles and then by introducing elastic and viscous connections between bones and soft tissues.

   The method used to model the soft tissue dynamics will provide information about the best marker locations for human motion analysis. This model will also increase the accuracy of data for clinical analyses for obese adolescents for example and help in understanding the contribution of the soft tissues to reduce the loads on the joints. Moreover, this program could have other impacts in the area of sports biomechanics and animation for movies and video games.

"Digital control is the heart of motion industry, and the associated algorithms can go from simple to more complex, with dynamics ranging from few microseconds to several tens of seconds. The need to perform complex computations with high real-time constraints has always been a major technological challenge for the development of advanced controllers. Thanks to major technological breakthroughs in recent years and sustained rapid progress in the areas of a massive scale integration and computer aided design tools, the realization of application specific chips becomes increasingly rapid and affordable, enabling electronic systems to cross new performance records. The reconfigurable FPGA permits now to design and validate quickly, in laboratory, any SoC. For low production volumes (few 1000s), the FPGA is economically advantageous as a final platform. For higher volume production, the description in the form of ""netlist"" of FPGA-based prototype of the controller can then be sent to an ICs fabric to be etched in silicon as an ASIC. However, as these new technologies are beginning to be used in digital control to overcome the limitations of microcontrollers and DSP processors used so far, new challenges are emerging due to several factors, including the difficulty for control specialists to work easily with these technologies, lack of design tools adapted for their needs, the increasing complexity of control algorithms to meet exigent dynamic, and the difficulty of implementing them in the form of ICs. The need for a research contribution to assist the development of generalized system on a chip for digital control is therefore felt. To meet this need, the main objective of the present proposal is to design and develop an effective technology that includes an easy design strategy and reusable hardware cores that are well adapted to both the user and performance criteria of the application. An FPGA platform will be used to support the proposed technology targeting real-time constraints no more than ten microseconds while keeping a low to moderate logic space for a cost-effective solution. The functionality and performance of this contribution will be demonstrated through some case studies of complex control AC drives.

"Nanotechnology has recently emerged as a rapidly growing field. The applications of nanoscience and nanotechnology are immense: nano-materials are used to strengthen composites and alloys; nano-mechanics govern 'smart' materials, capable of healing themselves from cracks; nano-biomechanics can be used to directly study the most inaccessible parts of the human body, etc. Along with rapid progress in nano-scale materials and systems, there is an increasing demand for probing into fine space and time scale. The main objective of this research is to develop an effective multiscale modeling method to practically simulate and analyze nano-scale problems, over a wide range of length and time scales. This method will be used to study problems, such as: behaviour of dislocations in metal crystal lattices, influence of new alloying and added elements on mechanical properties of metals, mechanical behaviour of HAp-TZP(3Y) nano-composite, fracture of defected carbon nanotubes, and dynamic behaviour of multi-wall carbon nanotubes used in nanoelectromechanical systems. Next by incorporating molecular simulations and a nonlinear continuum mechanics-based constitutive formulation that includes the behaviour of the polymer materials, a hyperelastic multiscale modeling technique will be developed. This technique will be employed to predict the elastic properties of polycarbonate (BPDA) and polyimide (APB) monomers. Finally the effects of nano-particles on the toughness of nano-composites, ZrO2/nano-SiC will be investigated. Overall, the proposed research aims to provide effective engineering tools for design and fabrication of nano-structured materials and systems. This will in turn lead to new theoretical developments and commercial applications in the nanotechnology area; and thus will bring competitive advantages to the Canadian companies in producing innovative nano-products in the very rapid growing market globally. The proposed research focus is in line with the priority research area as identified by NSERC in the 2000-2002 reallocations exercise report for GSC 13 and the newly established Canadian National Institute of Nanotechnology.","Sciences des mat�riaux","Avancement des connaissances","Mechanical Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"The Research Proposal I am putting forward in this NSERC Discovery Grant Application is very much a discovery project based on the bioprocessing of a type of human brain cell (i.e. adult stem harvested from somatic tissue) that I am now convinced will play a critically important role in a planned international clinical trial on Parkinson's disease. The first part of this clinical trial (i.e. based on stem cell therapy) will treat about 100 patients via transplantation of primary human tissue harvested from the ventral mesencephalon (VM) region of the human brain. The second stage of the clinical trial will use human brain cells produced using the bioreactor technology platform developed in my laboratory at the University of Calgary. The approach is a cell restorative strategy that focuses on restoring lost function by replacing the degenerated dopamine (DA)-producing neurons (DAergic neurons) using a transplantation procedure developed by a neurosurgeon colleague, Dr. Ivar Mendez, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).

    Specifically, I want to launch a new 4 part study on the expansion of human VM cells in bioreactors and eventually to enrich the cell population to an active type of neuron called A9 neurons that we now realize will play an essential role in increasing the success of the planned clinical trials. Preliminary experiments carried out on this problem in my laboratory have led me to the realization that this is an extremely difficult problem. However, having reviewed the literature data and our own preliminary data, I think that my Research Proposal has a very good chance of success in the short term since we have learned to avoid many pitfalls in tackling this problem. The proposed research strategies with human VM cells include examining - (1) hypoxic oxygen conditions, (2) role of calcium in cell growth media, (3) controlled conversion of the VM cells by exposure to inducing agents such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), dopamine, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-8 and/or forskolin, and (4) genetic manipulation by transfection of the VM cells with developmental cues such as Wnt5a or overexpression of the genes that are likely to be involved in production of the DAergic neurons.

"Advances in the Integrated Circuits (IC) technology have resulted in tremendous growth, making ICs prevalent in our lives. Today's ICs contain over a billion switching elements, transistors, which are connected through a complicated network of wires. The total length of these wires is estimated to be around three kilometers for every square centimeter of manufactured IC. All these transistors need to be placed (placement stage) and their interconnecting wires need to be routed (routing stage). The placement and routing stages need to be performed optimally and efficiently.  



The main objective of the proposed research program is to develop a new framework for placement and routing stages that is able to handle the sizes of circuits that will be encountered in the future. This framework will rely on new heuristics that use circuit structure and characteristics to improve the efficiency of the placement and routing stages. The proposed research has two focuses: developing algorithms that use mathematical modeling and circuit structure to implement hierarchy in design, and developing congestion reduction-based algorithms for routing.

"We use laser trapping and cooling techniques to capture radioactive atoms and precisely test the Standard Model (S.M.) of the weak interaction. Confined in a 1 mm-sized cloud, the nuclei undergo beta decay, producing three products: a positron, a neutrino, and a recoiling daughter nucleus. The daughter nucleus has only a few hundred eV of energy and would stop in a nm of material, but it freely escapes the trap. By detecting it in coincidence with the positron, we can measure the momentum and hence the angular distribution of neutrinos more directly than in previous experiments. 

We have set the best limits on scalar interactions coupling to the first generation of particles by measuring the beta-neutrino correlation in the Fermi decay of a spin-0 nucleus. An approved proposal at high priority will extend these measurements to lower beta energy to compete directly with the Fierz scalar-vector interference term constraints from the Q-value dependence of many 0+ to 0+ Ft experiments. Our planned methods would halve their error to 0.001, providing meaningful sensitivity to one theoretical source of semileptonic interactions (left-right SUSY fermion mixing) that is difficult to constrain in high-energy experiments. 

We have learned to spin-polarize other nuclei and measure the polarization of the decaying species by atomic methods independent of the nuclear decays. When combined with beta-recoil coincidences, this capability allows us to measure novel correlations. We have published a measurement of the neutrino asymmetry of 37K with 3% errors. A new proposal for spin-correlation measurements to 0.1 to 0.3% level by Dan Melconian of Texas A&M has been accepted by the TRIUMF EEC at high priority. 

We have developed techniques for the above experiments by doing other experiments suitable for students. Two M.Sc.'s were done on the spin asymmetry of daughter nuclei in 80Rb decay, and we have submitted for publication limits on tensor interactions. A Ph.D. student is searching for exotic massive particles in two-body nuclear isomer decay, developing a spectrometer to precisely measure the nuclear daughter momenta.

The ISAC experiments use the recoil mass separator DRAGON, Annular Chamber of Tracking and ID of Charged Particles TACTIC, solid-state detector array TUDA, neutral atom trap TRINAT, a general purpose station, collinear laser spectroscopy. The experiments are performed by the co-applicants and a number of experimenters outside of TRIUMF, primarily from Canada, the U.K., the U.S.A., and Israel. The experiments address a wide variety of science including reaction cross-sections, nuclear properties, lifetimes, and asymptotic normalization coefficients needed for nuclear astrophysics; structure of exotic nuclei investigated by reactions and laser spectroscopy; searches for new interactions and particles in beta decay; mass separation of prospective biomedical isotopes for suitability for targeting cancer cells. 

The technician envisioned (Peter Machule) provides a unique resource combining skills that enable efficient completion of experiments and utilization of the ISAC beam. This technician has been supported in the past by pieces of individual project grants. Placing this in the MRS program would  provide better access to the technician by a wider variety of experimenters, greater stability of support, and greater accountability of that support.

"Gromov-Witten invariants are important in String Theory, the physical theory according to which elementary particles are tiny strings, instead of points, as was believed since Newton. String theory is the best candidate for the so-called Theory of Everything, which  unifies all physical theories, in particular Einstein's theory of relativity and the quantum field theory. 



Recently it was discovered that Gromov-Witten invariants are related to the so-called Donaldson-Thomas invariants.  This is connection is, in fact, still a conjecture, but it is very important, because Donaldson-Thomas invariants can explain many strange phenomena exhibited by Gromov-Witten invariants. 



In my recent research I discovered something surprising about Donaldson-Thomas invariants. They behave like Euler characteristics.  The Euler characteristic of a shape is a number which does not change, if the shape is deformed as if it was made of rubber.  The surface of a sphere, for example, has Euler characteristic 2.  The surface of a donut shape has Euler characteristic 0. The fact that Donaldson-Thomas invariants are certain kinds of Euler characteristics has important consequences, also for Gromov-Witten invariants and hence for String Theory. 



The goal for the future is to understand these Euler characteristics more deeply and make them a more flexible tool.  They should not just be numbers, but some more complicated structure.  Numbers are for counting things, but the things are lost in the process.  I will discover the ""things"" which are ""counted"" by the Euler characteristics which give rise to Donaldson-Thomas invariants.","Non disponible","Non disponible","Pure & Applied Maths - A",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"In the proposed project a novel robot will be developed to operate inside a freezer at -80C. It will provide a robotic high throughput solution to biobanking, i.e. storage and retrieval of biological samples for a variety of research projects. Biobanking is of strategic importance to a wide range of research activities in health science from genetic research to the development and evaluation of drugs and treatments. Storage of the biological sample tubes at a very low temperature and providing high frequency access to them at the same time introduces a dilemma to automation technology. These samples are sensitive to temperature fluctuations and therefore it is preferred for any automatic handling solution to be located completely inside the freezer. However, the extreme temperature makes such a solution challenging since many of the available technologies fail in such low temperature. In the proposed project, a novel robot is designed in such a way that all the sensitive parts including the actuators and sensors are stationary located outside the freezer. The mechanical power is transported using a single loop of cable. A coordinated movement of the stationary actuators determine the position of the robot end-effector. This has also significantly reduced the moving mass of the robot facilitating the high accelerations and velocities. It is expected that the robot provide 600 accesses to individual sample tubes per hour.

"Microbial life is responsible for an immense number of medical and environmental processes. The role of microbes in infectious disease is well known, but bacteria also provide essential services to us, including extracting important nutrients from our food. In the environment, microbes are essential in the turnover of nutrients, breaking down and building up important molecules in a cycle that is global in scope.



By sequencing microbial genomes, we can learn a great deal about the roles they play and the myriad complex ways in which they interact. But the sheer amount of data is overwhelming, and the rate of increase in computer speed is being overtaken by the flood of sequence data. We need new and better computational methods to be able to take a random sampling of DNA from the environment and assess its function and its history. Accurate analysis will allow us to highlight the key genes and organisms from a given environment, opening up new possibilities for control and harnessing the potential of these microbial populations. We also stand to learn a great deal about the evolutionary history of these organisms and populations, shedding light on four billion years of microbial evolution.



The goal of my research is to build computational tools that are fast, accurate, and statistically sound, which can meet the challenges of emerging genome data sets. Important parts of this work include applications for the assignment of functions to newly discovered genes, new methods to track the evolutionary histories of genes and whole genomes, and simulation methods to gauge the accuracy of our conclusions. An important unifying theme is the use of evolutionary history to assess and understand microbial diversity.

"The expression of genes in response to specific stimuli is carried out by a large group of proteins known as transcription factors.  In order to direct transcription in an appropriate spatial and temporal fashion, these proteins must direct the coordinated assembly and disassembly of large protein machines on chromatin.  The objective of my research program is to understand how proteins are shuttled to and from gene expression machinery during transcription by the basic-Helix-Loop-Helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors. It is my goal to understand how these changes alter protein function in response to different signals. This information will aid in the rational design of therapies that exploit transcription factor function and are directly targeted at their activities.  I have chosen to study two tightly regulated model systems; aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-regulated CYP1A1 activity; and, hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a)-regulated VEGF and EPO expression.  I have established that estrogens, through the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER), repress AHR function via direct protein-protein interactions.  Furthermore, ER does so by facilitating an exchange for the histone deacetylase, HDAC4 for the co-repressor protein, RIP140 at the regulatory elements of AHR target genes. In part 1 of this study, I propose to elucidate the molecular determinants of ER-mediated repression of AHR-regulated transcription. I have designed a series of experiments to understand how estrogen-responsive recruitment of the repressor RIP140 modulates AHR activity and to determine the role HDAC4 plays in maintaining RIP140 in a state conducive to AHR-mediated gene transcription.  The second part of this proposal outlines my plans to elucidate the role of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) on HIF-1a regulated transcription. I have demonstrated that the co-activator TRIP230 is essential for transcriptional activation by HIF-1a.  In addition, I have evidence that mediated HIF-1a-dependent transcriptional activity is negatively regulated by Rb. Together, these studies will increase our understanding of normal AHR physiology, vasculogenesis, and transcription factor function in general.

"The long term goals of my research program are to understand the distribution of, and interactions between, factors that influence community assembly and structure in lake plankton metacommunities.  The research focuses on plankton because their structure and assembly are of primary importance for the functioning and services provided by  lake ecosystems (e.g. recreational fisheries, water quality, invasive species spread).  The first objective of the proposed research is to explore how changes to abiotic factors influence community structure in plankton.  Specifically I will examine the role of the stability and type of thermal stratification within lakes. Research in marine systems has long focused on the role of physical mixing in the water column, uncovering its ability to influence the rates of contact and ecological interaction (competition, predation) between plankton individuals and species.  I will examine these effects, which have been grossly understudied in lakes, by using a novel large-scale experimental approach to alter the normal pattern of mixing and thermocline formation.  The second objective of the proposed research works to furthering our understanding of the mechanisms that drive community assembly in lake plankton by examining functional trait composition across gradients of lakes.  Functional trait distributions shed insight into ecological factors affecting community assembly and are likely to be more relevant to community assembly than taxonomy alone. Overall, my research program furthers understanding of how plankton community structure relates to gradients of spatial structure (both within-lake and landscape-level), biotic challenge (invasive species) and biogeochemical factors (e.g. phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon).

"The University of Manitoba was recently awarded a $7.4 M from the Canada Foundation for Innovation to establish the Manitoba Regional Materials and Surface Characterization Facility. A Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) laboratory was established as part of this facility. The departments of Geological Sciences, Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and several other researchers greatly benefit from the SIMS laboratory at the University of Manitoba.

A theme of this proposal is to enhance a collaborative study of biogeochemical carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles on various temporal scales and in different environmental settings as well as the understanding of alteration that these biogeochemical signals experienced by diagenesis, metamorphism, radiolysis, and

subduction to the mantle. Recently, Fayek and Bekker established a CFI and RTI funded stable isotope laboratory at the University of Manitoba. The laboratory has two gas-source mass-spectrometers connected to four peripherals: two elemental analyzers (EA), thermal conversion elemental analyzer (TC-EA) and GasBench II. Combined, this infrastructure permits isotopic characterization (e.g. C, S, H, N, and O) of diverse geological materials and waters. However, the infrastructure for sample preparation and characterization for stable isotope analysis is neither adequate nor efficient at the Department of Geological Sciences. Specifically, equipment to prepare large uncontaminated sample powders, binocular microscope with a camera to hand-pick and document mineral separates, and carbon and sulfur analyzer to measure organic and inorganic carbon and S contents are either outdated or lacking.  Therefore, the infrastructure requested here will be used to establish and advance a capability that currently either does not exist or not fully functional at the University of Manitoba, but is necessary for the cutting edge research in stable isotope geochemistry of the applicants as well as other researchers at the University of Manitoba.

"The redox states of the atmosphere and ocean changed dramatically in the Precambrian.  The rise of atmospheric oxygen has been constrained, based on geological and geochemical evidence, to have occurred between ca. 2.45 and 2.32 Ga, during the assembly of the first supercontinent and a series of ca. 2.48-2.42 Ga mantle plume breakouts.  This sequence of events led to several perturbations in Earth's surface environment, including global glaciations followed by extreme greenhouse conditions, carbon isotope excursions in seawater composition, the rise of seawater sulfate content, and changes in the ocean redox state. Since these events affected surface environments globally, they have implications not only for the understanding the history and stability of the Earth System, but also for correlation between Paleoproterozoic basins that otherwise lack high precision geochronologic constraints.

   On an applied level, understanding the redox evolution of the global Precambrian ocean may shed light on the development of uniquely Precambrian mineralization processes.  Giant sedimentary mineral deposits (e.g. iron formations, Mn-deposits, phosphorites, sulfates, and sedex deposits) reflect these non-actualistic states of the ocean redox state.  The deeper understanding of changes in redox state of the atmosphere and ocean will provide a predictive tool to search for giant sedimentary mineral deposits.

   The funding will be used to support graduate-student work to develop a better temporal control and stratigraphic resolution over the evolution of surface environments in the Proterozoic.  By combining detrital zircon and xenotime geochronology with high-resolution chemostratigraphy, we will establish the temporal framework required to reliably correlate Paleoproterozoic successions, understand the evolution of the Earth System, and predict temporal distribution of giant sedimentary mineral deposits.

   The results of this research will appeal to astrobiologists (Earth System stability), economic geologists, Precambrian geologists and stratigraphers.

"IMINIUM CYCLIZATIONS/AZOMETHINE YLID CYCLOADDITION CASCADES FOR ALKALOID SYNTHESES



In this research proposal, we intend to develop two innovative ways of constructing natural products through cyclization reactions in cascade. In one of our projects, we are using iminium ions in a double cyclization cascade. We started by setting the first cyclization (Vilsmeier-Haack), which was greatly challenging and ended up giving rise to two publications (Org. Lett. 2005, 7, 4431 and J. Org. Chem. 2006, 71, 704). Our preliminary results of double cyclization showed that the strategy works on a model systems. The proposed research is thus aimed at determining the scope and limitation of the double cyclization strategy and at constructing natural products with this new synthetic strategy to show its applicability. Our second project is also taking advantage of our recently developed Vilsmeier-Hack cyclization but toward a completely different end. In fact, the Vilsmeier-Haack cyclization product is still an iminium ion that we used to generate an azomethine ylid that could undergo a completely different type of cyclization (cycliaddition) compared to a second iminium cyclization as found in the first project presented. This strategy (iminium cyclization - azomethine ylid cycloaddition) now offers the possibility to create tricyclic cores of biologically interesting alkaloids in one operation. We are pursuing this project by expanding the scope of this reaction cascade to a wide range of different alkaloid skeletons by simple modulation on the starting compound. We also intend to apply this synthetic strategy to the construction of natural product as well.

"Silicon (Si) is one of the most abundant elements on the surface of the earth but its essentiality in plant growth

has not been clearly established. While its nutritional role in plants appears limited, Si absorption plays an

important function in alleviating biotic and abiotic stresses in plants known to be strong Si accumulators. The

main objective of this project is to augment plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses by cloning the Si

transport genes in plants known to be deficient in Si absorption. Our strategy, as elaborated with our partner

Syngenta Crop Protection Canada, is to test our hypothesis via a proof of concept over the first two years,

while, in parallel, optimizing the different parameters inherent to the technology within the four-year project.

For the proof of concept, we intend to successfully transform soybean plants with Si-transport genes from rice,

demonstrate the superior ability of such transformants to absorb Si, select transformants displaying efficient

Si-transport gene expression and Si absorption, and use the transformed seeds for soybean rust resistance

assessment on mature plants. In parallel, we intend to isolate Si-transport gene orthologs from plant species

known to be among the best Si-accumulators (e.g. wheat, barley, etc.). The efficiency of those gene orthologs at

transporting Si will be compared to that of rice genes using the oocyte assay.The transformants will be screened

for improved Si-absorption and the best ones selected for soybean rust resistance evaluation. Greenhouse and

field trials will complete the characterization of the transformants. In the context of the proof of concept alone,

the potential benefits of the technology to Canadian soybean growers and to Syngenta Crop Protection Canada

would be immense in the wake of the apparition of soybean rust in Canada and the commercial race for a

solution. For the appplicants and their academic institution, the demonstration of a technology for durable

resistance of soybean rust would have far-reaching scientific implications and an instant worldwide

recognition. This would also open up an innovative and environment-friendly strategy to develop plants with

multiple stress tolerance.","Produits chimiques agricoles (engrais, pesticides, herbicides)","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"During the last 3 decades, the Arctic Ocean has lost 50% of its permanent sea ice cover, exposing more surface waters to direct solar radiation. This phenomenon stimulates light-driven carbon processes: primary production by phytoplankton and photo-oxidation of dissolved organic matter (DOM). While the stimulation of primary producers by increased light availability has been recently documented, the impacts of this radiative forcing on photochemical oxidation of DOM and the net balance between light-driven carbon fluxes has received little attention thus far. Indeed, DOM in the Arctic Ocean surface originates largely from northern terrestrial ecosystems, which store nearly one third of global soil organic carbon. These ecosystems are currently experiencing important biogeochemical transformations under a warming climate, modifying the quantity and chemical character of terrigenous DOM, and the relative abundance of organic and inorganic nutrient inputs into the Arctic Ocean. Here I propose a framework to study the net balance between light-stimulated carbon fluxes in the Arctic Ocean using a diagnostic modelling approach. Therefore, a satellite-based spectral radiative transfer model for the coupled atmosphere-ocean system will be developed to quantify photochemical processes and assess trends in the net balance between primary production and photoooxidation. The parameterization of the photochemical models will be based on in situ observations gathered during research cruises in the Arctic Ocean. In order to predict variation in these photochemical parameters, their variability will be investigated in relation to observable or calculable environmental parameters. The novelty of this proposal resides in the synergetic use of various remotely sensed parameters of the environment merged within a diagnostic modelling approach to answer fundamental questions regarding climate change feedbacks. In particular, the work will aim to exploit the continuous ocean colour observations provided by satellites since 1997. The results should benefit studies focusing on remote sensing problems, global biogeochemical cycles, climate modeling, marine photosynthesis and DOM photochemistry.","Oc�ans, mers et estuaires",Environnement,"Environmental Earth Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"In recent years several branches of mathematics, as well as of physics and telecommunications industry, have benefitted from a very large number of applications of results, methods and tools from noncommutative, and especially free, probability theory. The main objective of the research

I intend to investigate questions related to regularity issues for distributions of sums of selfadjoint random variables which are free over a finite dimensional algebra, as well as positivity questions in this context. The case when the finite dimensional algebra is the algebra of scalar multiples of the unit is rather well understood and very powerful methods and tools from complex analysis are available for its study. These tools have been generalized by Voiculescu and (in a combinatorial context) Speicher to the case of an arbitrary (not necessarily one-dimensional) unital algebra. However, the difficulties involved in dealing with analytic functions on spaces of large dimensions have prevented us from obtaining results as powerful as in the one-dimensional case. I propose to tackle these difficulties by employing new methods from fixed point theory and matrix analysis. I hope this will allow me to prove regularity results of comparable strength with the ones proved in the one-dimensional case. I hope as well that such progresses will be achieved for positivity questions related to operator-valued random variables, allowing a clear connection to be made between complex-valued distributions of n-tuples of random variables and operator-valued distributions of single random variables.","Sciences math�matiques","Avancement des connaissances","Pure & Applied Maths - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan

"One phenomenon stemming from individual behaviour and which can have strong impacts on the structure and dynamics of animal populations is territoriality. Indeed, if an individual or a group of individuals defends an area, then a fraction of the population may be prevented from gaining access to breeding sites (i.e., float) or forced to use low quality habitats. The reduced fitness of individuals excluded from good habitats or forced to forego breeding may in turn reduce the population growth rate.

   The influence that territoriality may have on populations is likely to operate through the size of territories, because large defended areas will lead to a greater number of displaced or floating individuals. Territory size is likely to result from a compromise between the benefits of gaining exclusive access to some resources and the costs of defending them. An important, but misunderstood factor that may alter the costs and benefits of territories is landscape structure, namely the composition and configuration of habitat patches and their edges. Besides the inherent quality of habitat patches, likely a major determinant of the economy of resource defence, habitat edges may reduce defence costs by limiting intrusion rates, but may also reduce benefits by constraining the movement of individuals within the territory. It is therefore not surprising that habitat edges have been observed to lead to an increase or decrease in territory size, depending on situations.

   My research program aims to dissect the spatially-explicit interplay among the composition and configuration of vegetation patches and the distribution of food resources on the spatio-temporal distribution of territorial and floating Ruby-throated Hummingbirds, as well as their movements and interactions. To do this, we will use an innovative system that allows us to record the concurrent, spatially-explicit movements and foraging behaviour of 80-120 hummingbirds over a 32-ha area composed of field, fallow, and forest patches, and this throughout entire breeding seasons. This system of hummingbird feeders equipped with PIT-tag readers allow us to manipulate the number, size, and quality of food patches in both space and time.

"Low molecular weight building blocks have recently attracted enormous interest in terms of bottom-up fabrication of organic materials. The building blocks currently used in supramolecular chemistry are synthesized mainly from non renewable-based raw materials. However, the 'green' chemical synthesis presents distinct advantages for the generation of new bio-based building blocks since they are obtainable from renewable resources. The specific objectives of the proposal are: 1) Catalysts formulation and characterization; 2) Optimization of the metathesis reaction operating conditions for a model functionalized olefin: methyl oleate ester; 3) Catalyst stability and its resistance to deactivation; 4) Metathesis of a model triglyceride simulating typical vegetable oils; 5) Metathesis of a used vegetable oils (used high oleic sunflower). There is a high potential for developing new knowledge in the area of catalysis, materials chemistry, bio-based polymer reaction engineering. The benefits that would accrue from this project are highly significant to the Canadian fats and oils industry, the Canadian Agri-business overall as well as the Canadian plastics industry. This study has direct implications not only with respect to value-addition to recycled vegetable oils but also with respect to the development of catalytic process that meets the requirements of 'Green Chemistry', and the production of feed stocks to the bioplastics industry from renewable resources while reducing the demand from plastics industry for hydrocarbons from non-renewable resources. Thus this research could contribute to the development of bioplastics technologies and benefit the bioplastics sector and the plastics industry. There are opportunities for the Canadian Food and food service sectors to recycle and process used vegetable oils profitably to value-added products, and to improve the profitability and competitiveness for the Canadian oil seed growers and fats and oil processors.

This project will contribute to the training of highly qualified personnel in lipid chemistry, catalysis, reaction engineering and materials science.

"One of the current health crises facing our country is the obesity ""epidemic"".  Excessive weight and a lack of exercise carry serious health consequences (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, hypertension) that are costly to treat.  Physical inactivity (e.g. a sedentary lifestyle) is considered to be a major contributing factor to this ""epidemic"".  One way to address this issue would be to increase participation in exercise.   To do this it would be useful to understand the factors that influence motivation to engage in physical activity.  My research program addresses this issue by studying the conditions that influence motivation to run in an animal model.  In my lab, rats work, by pressing a lever, to obtain an opportunity to run.  How hard the animal will work for an opportunity to run tells us how motivated the animal is to run or put another way, how rewarding running is for that animal.  The conditions that influence the rewarding value of running have not been as extensively investigated as those for food and water so it may be beneficial to learn more about the rewarding value of running.  How does it differ from, and in what ways is it similar to, the rewarding value of food and water?

     In this project, I will examine why rats did not prefer a longer opportunity to run over a shorter one when given a choice between them.  One would assume that a longer period would be more rewarding because it allows for more running.  I will also examine factors that influence how rats choose between food and running when given a limited budget to spend on these two commodities and when the prices/cost of the two commodities vary.  Finally, I will examine why mice that are bred to run at high rates and considered to be ""addicted"" to running are not willing to work for running when the opportunity to run is brief.

"Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is essential for the normal development and tissue function of all animals. Changes in the expression of cell death genes can promote apoptosis. My laboratory has discovered a pivotal new cellular signaling pathway that controls life versus death decisions termed the TAF6delta pathway. Here we propose a research program designed to define the molecular mechanisms by which TAF6delta induces cell death. We have two major goals, 1) the identification of the genes controlled by TAF6delta that cause cell death, and 2) the identification of the proteins that act upstream of TAF6delta to control its expression.

These studies will shed new light on the mechanisms controlling life versus death decision of animals cells.

"This project is about how populations become adapted to changing environments.  In particular, if conditions become too stressful a population must either adapt by natural selection or become extinct.  We need to know more about the process of 'evolutionary rescue' in order to understand and predict how populations will respond to rapid environmental change.  I propose three main areas of inquiry.  The first concerns the variability of natural environments and the pattern of selection it creates.  I shall develop wild yeast as a general model system for ecology and evolution in order to use the power of yeast genomic technology to study evolutionary change in natural populations. Secondly, I will conduct selection experiments in the laboratory to find out whether a population is likely to adapt to a given stress. These experiments use microbial populations that turn over very rapidly in order to study 'evolution in real time'. Whether they adapt should depend on the magnitude of the stress and on the genetic variation present in the population  Finally, I shall discover how phytoplankton, which are responsible for a large fraction of global primary production, will respond to elevated levels of carbon dioxide.  This will also involve laboratory experiments using unicellular algae, to find out how individual species adapt over several hundred generations, and also how the species composition of whole communities changes.  We need to understand these processes in order to predict how ecosystems will respond to global change in the course of the next century.  Experimental evolution is a powerful way of both investigating general principles and probing the future behaviour of natural populations and communities.

"My research program aims at increasing our understanding of the functional interactions among genes that direct the development of complex organs in a eukaryote.  The model system used is Drosophila and the approach is to do a genetic and molecular biological analysis of some of the specific genes involved in wing formation and how some of the same genes have broader roles in organogenesis in non-wing tissues. Past work in the laboratory concentrated on analysis of the role of the vestigial (vg) gene in wing development and how vg interacts functionally with the scalloped (sd) gene.  The sd gene is vital, in that homozygous mutations may be lethal.  It is known that sd is a member of a highly conserved family of transcriptions factors (the TEA/ATTS domain proteins) and, as such, has a fundamental role in Drosophila development whereas vg seems to be required only in the wing.  A fusion gene has been produced which includes full length vg and the sdTEA domain (about 30% of SD) and when this protein is expressed it can rescue sd or vg mutations, and even sd, vg double mutations.  Thus, the encoded protein behaves like the natural VG/SD complex in the context of wing development. Further, 70% of the SD protein is not required for wing formation even though SD is a vital protein. A significant aspect of this work is that the human TEF-1 gene is a homologue of sd and can actually rescue sd mutations when transformed into flies.  Particular effort is now directed towards the function of sd in non-wing tissues. We have discovered protein binding partners for SD in muscle and nervous tissue and feel that the vital function of SD is involved in the development of these tissues.  In fact, sd null mutant flies, which are lethal as homozygotes, do not develop a normal heart. We are also characterizing post-translational modifications that occur on the VG and SD proteins in attempts to elucidate how and when these proteins bind to each other, and in the case of SD to proteins in other tissues as well.  The genes involved in Drosophila muscle development have vertebrate homologues. Hence, data gathered in this model system have a significant likelihood of helping us to understand the more complex vertebrate systems.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"Strategic Operations Research (SOR) is defined as ""...OR that achieves a sustainable competitive advantage"" [Bell, 1998].  We propose to continue our research to identify major organizations that see their OR competence as an important competitive weapon.  We have compiled a extensive list of SOR examples from verified, published applications in the journal Interfaces, including the Edelman Prize finalist applications and are working on a not-for-profit version of SOR which would extend our understanding of how OR can be ""strategic"" when the competitive element is missing from the organization's objectives.

We have identified revenue management (RM) as an important SOR problem area that includes pricing, product protection levels, discount allocation, ""fencing"", short-selling or replaning, and innovative new products (such as the ""travel right"").  We have written the first article on replaning as an RM tool and developed some results, and propose to continue researching some of the new business ideas emerging from the RM literature, including fences and fencing strategies in RM (including fences that are revenue producing), the merger of RM and supply chain optimization, and the revenue enhancing properties of the ""travel right"". 

We see a major reseearch opportunity in the migration of RM tools from the service area (airlines, hotels etc.) where the field began to manufactured (perhaps re-stockable) products. Our proposed research in this area includes investigating the impact of product returns on pricing and inventory policies, characterizing fences and determining market segmentation strategies, and investigating the effect of different operations level decision protocols of the firm's strategic and tactical decision making.

RM has emerged as a highly important (and highly used) area of OR where novel theory and models are actually being used by major corporations to achieve significant gains. Research on the usefulness of new tools and the development of new implementation strategies will extend this already highly relevant application area.

"My NSERC-funded research program is dedicated to understanding the extent to which different critical periods of growth and development are susceptible to adverse metabolic programming through inappropriate nutritional intake.  In this context, programming is defined as the permanent changes in function that occur as the result of modified nutritional intake during development.  My research examines the effects of excessive or inappropriate nutrient availability during sensitive periods of development, which is highly relevant in contemporary Canadian society.

Specific objectives addressed in this grant cycle are to: 1) determine the extent to which maternal intake of simple carbohydrates (specifically fructose (FR) or glucose (GLU)) leads to alterations in nutrient availability during fetal development, and 2) characterize metabolic programming of the pancreas and skeletal muscle in offspring.  I will use female rats given a 10% FR or GLU solution in place of drinking water as the experimental model.  Pilot data indicates that rat dams give a FR solution experience mild-moderate elevations in their blood glucose and insulin concentrations during pregnancy, confirming that nutrient availability to the developing fetus is altered.  Maternal and fetal blood, along with amniotic fluid will be sampled to examine nutrient availability during pregnancy. Nutrient transport protein expression in placenta will complement this assessment.  In offspring, a combination of in vivo and in vitro techniques will be used to determine effects on pancreatic structure and function along with changes incurred in skeletal muscle, a primary contributor to whole-body glucose metabolism.

These studies will be among the first to examine effects enhanced simple carbohydrate intake on mechanisms affecting fetal development in combination with the long-term impact on glucose homeostasis in offspring.  Results are significant for understanding basic human biology and have application to clinical nutrition along with broader public health policies.

"This research focuses on two themes: the dynamics of the Newfoundland ice cap during the last glaciation from retreat offshore to final melting in the interior; and the history of sea-level fluctuations around Newfoundland in response to deglaciation. Deglacial dynamics will be investigated through examination of the ""Digital Landforms Database of Newfoundland"" and field mapping of glacial landforms.  A new initiative in this proposal is to combine glacial landform data from the seabed offshore, mapped using multibeam sonar, with landform data onshore, mapped from aerial photographs and satellite imagery.  Topics of particular research interest are the evidence for former ice streams in the Newfoundland ice cap and the timing and configuration of ice-marginal retreat.  Results should provide new potential for drift prospecting studies and will have immediate application to the mineral exploration industry in Newfoundland.

    )	Relative sea-level studies have gained increased attention as we attempt to forecast global sea-level responses to climate warming over the next century.  Past sea-level records suggest strong regional variability in this response, primarily due to residual effects from the last glaciation.  The proposed research addresses the spatial and temporal variation in postglacial relative sea-level change in Newfoundland, a region that may experience moderate to significant impacts even under the most conservative scenarios of future sea-level rise.  A major focus of this research will be the collection of precise sea-level data to improve our understanding of sea-level processes, specifically the glacio-isostatic evolution of Newfoundland, and to provide quantitative information for the modelling community.  Application of glacial systems modelling to questions of sea-level history requires excellent data to constrain the models.  

     My program is strongly interdisciplinary in nature, involving collaboration with scientists from archaeology, biology, geology, marine geophysics, and physics.   There is also a strong emphasis on graduate training across these disciplines and this is reflected in the number of proposed co-supervised PhD and MSc students.

"Rotational molding is used to produce hollow parts such as tanks used for chemical, agricultural and automotive applications, boat shells, and outdoor furniture. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a rapid prototyping technique that has the potential for direct production of 3D functional parts from CAD files. Although seemingly different, rotational molding and FDM are alike as the integrity of parts fabricated using either technology controlled by polymer sintering (densification). Moreover, in both processes, melt densification and solidification occur without the application of shear or pressure. 



In order for FDM to evolve into a manufacturing tool the mechanical properties of the parts produced should be enhanced so that they can maintain their integrity during service. Additionally, the variety of polymer grades available for use in this process should increase. The rotational molding industry faces similar challenges; its growth into engineering applications is limited by the choice of materials suitable for the process.



This proposal addresses issues that are common to rotational molding and FDM, and which limit technological developments in their respective field of applications. Particular attention will be given to melt densification (sintering and bubble dissolution), melt solidification, and how these phenomena are affected by changes in the material chemical composition. Additives and chemical treatments have been selected as to improve either the material surface energy (sintering) or the rate of bubble dissolution in the melt. A general objective is to establish structure-processing-property relationships. Knowledge will be applied in developing new polymer grades suitable for each process.

"My research interest focuses on the developmental and molecular genetic events associated with seed coat development in oilseeds.  One of the underlying mechanisms of development is through the localized expression of genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) at specific times and places.  Identification of TF genes that are essential for growth and development of oilseed crops such as canola (Brassica napus) by conventional genetic approaches has been limiting. Understanding the transcriptional mechanisms that control seed development in the closely related model species Arabidopsis thaliana will very likely provide the insight necessary to solve this issue.  Growth of oilseeds like Arabidopsis and canola relies on the coordinated development of the embryo, endosperm and seed coat.  Unlike the embryo and endosperm, the seed coat has received little attention when it comes to understanding the structural and genetic mechanisms that underlie its function. For example, the function of the proximal seed coat, which comprises the chalazal proliferating tissue and chalazal seed coat is unknown.  However, histological observations suggest a transport function due to transfer cell morphology.  Moreover, rapid differentiation of this tissue makes it an ideal candidate to study cell differentiation.  Based on these results I will carry out extensive histological studies to observe the effects of genetic perturbations on proximal seed coat development.  The requested semi-motorized rotary microtome and glass knife maker will be used for (1) generating paraffin-embedded thick sections for laser capture microdissection and RNA profiling of the chalazal proliferating tissue in Arabidopsis and (2) anatomical observations of the proximal seed coat following genetic perturbations using thin plastic-embedded sections.  Since this instrument can produce ribbons using both paraffin and plastic embedded materials, it provides the advantage to perform organized high-throughput reconstruction of seed parts.  No microtome with these features is currently available in our department.  Moreover, this instrument will be used to train highly qualified personnel in the art of histology which contribute greatly to thesis and publication quality figures.

"This research will be targeting the design of a high-performance fully integrated wideband receiver system.  The immediate application for the receiver will be a new radio telescope.  The radio telescope will be the largest telescope ever built and is the main research focus of many radio astronomers at the present time.  The telescope is known in the astronomical community as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).  This telescope will have a footprint of 3000km and will require tens of millions of receivers.  The fully integrated receiver, investigated during the proposed research, will have a significant impact on the telescope final cost.

     Recent work by the applicant has shown that at least over a relatively narrow frequency range (0.7GHz-1.4GHz) for radio astronomy standards the latest wide-spread commercial integrated circuit technologies, Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technologies, are able to nearly achieve performance requirements of the SKA receiver system.  This proposed research will build on the prior work and will investigate novel ways of increasing the receiver bandwidth to ultimately cover the full telescope frequency range from 0.3GHz to 25GHz.  The challenging aspect of this research is the desire to reduce any noise imposed by the receiver onto incoming signals to levels that are significantly lower than what is commonly achieved with commercial receiver systems.  The final solution will be based on commercially available technologies to control receiver costs as the anticipated number of the receivers exceeds tens of millions.

    This proposed research will strive to completely integrate the SKA receiver into a single integrated circuit.  The results of the research conducted under this proposal will be applicable for commercial Ultra Wide Band applications and other applications requiring high-end wideband receivers.

"

All organisms are continually subjected to a day/night cycle of approximately 24 hours.  Through evolution, an internal biological clock developed as a means of anticipating this regular pattern. In mammals, the central or master biological clock is found in a small region of the brain, and is responsible for not only coordinating behaviour, but also the timing of basic physiological processes, such as arousal, cognition, hormonal regulation, metabolism and energy balance. This clock operates at the molecular level through a combination of positive and negative regulatory loops, involving transcription factors and other relevant proteins. These clock proteins are expressed in all cells, including the brain and other organs, such as the liver and the heart. At a basic level, a specific region of the brain called the hypothalamus, expresses a variety of neuropeptides that are directly responsible for the control of energy balance via a complex array of neuronal and hormonal signals. These hypothalamic signals lead to the initiation or cessation of feeding behaviour. Recently, the importance of the circadian system in weight regulation was validated when clock mutant mice, with an abnormal circadian cycle, were found to develop metabolic syndrome and obesity. We intend to study how the circadian machinery affects the rhythmic production of four specific proteins linked to feeding, and whether these rhythms can be affected from output signals produced by neurons in the central biological clock. Although it is generally accepted that the body operates quite routinely on a classic day/night schedule, the molecular events involved in the circadian regulation of basic physiological processes are not yet understood. Since the intact circadian clock is critical for maintaining metabolic processes, including energy balance in the body, we now intend to define the proteins that play a role in this process, and ultimately to identify the underlying regulatory mechanisms involved.

"In recent work we have investigated the biological roles of three key DNA repair genes in the model plant Arabidopsis. This work has allowed us to extend to plants some conclusions that had been drawn from work in yeast and mice, but more importantly, it has allowed us to uncover features that seem to be unique to plants. In the proposed work, we will first examine whether the genes under study exert a similar effect on meiotic recombination as we have shown on mitotic recombination. This is crucial as meiotic recombination is the key player in applied genetics (breeding better varieties for example). Secondly, we propose to perform a mutant screen in order to uncover additional genes limiting recombination between similar but non-identical sequences in plants. These novel mutants will be tested against each other to determine how many distinct mutations these represent. Furthermore, these mutations will be mapped to allow the eventual cloning of these genes. Lastly, we will explore a distinctive feature of the plant MutL homologues we have studied (AtMLH1 and AtPMS1). Mutants in both of these genes exhibit a marked segregation bias against the mutant allele when it is segregating alongside a wild-type allele. Such a phenomenon is not seen with a MutS homologue (AtMSH2) indicating that it does not simply result from the lack of MMR activity. To investigate this phenotype, we will try to determine when this bias arose. In addition, pollen germination and pollen tube growth will be tested. To begin to understand the role played by AtMLH1 in pollen development or function, we will use a functional complementation approach.

"Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are a sub-class of naturally occurring biological antifreezes. AFGP 1 is the largest fraction (33.7 KDa) and AFGP 8 (2.6 KDa, figure 1) is the lowest molecular weight fraction. These compounds are found predominately in Teleost fish and protect these organisms against cryoinjury and death by preventing the uncontrolled growth of seeded ice crystals in vivo.   

   During the past several years our laboratory has been actively involved in the rational design and synthesis of carbon-linked (C-linked) AFGP analogues possessing enhanced chemical and biological stability as well as increased antifreeze activity.  This class of compounds is ideally suited for cryopreservation applications as they do not exhibit any cytotoxicity and inhibit caspase enzymes in vitro.  The studies described in this proposal will employ well-developed synthetic methodologies to synthesize a series of C-linked AFGP analogues which when tested for activity, will identify the key structural attributes necessary to inhibit the recrystallization of ice in tissues.  With this information we will be able to design the ""ultimate"" C-linked AFGP analogue suitable for medical, commercial and industrial applications.  

   Graduate and undergraduate students training in this interdisciplinary environment will acquire essential skills in scientific experimentation, organic synthesis and cell biology preparing them for successful careers in the biopharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing industries as well as academic research.

"Imaging systems are increasingly playing a critical role in a number of disciplines including engineering, medicine, and biology. The requirements on the performance of these systems in terms of imaging accuracy or resolution, and imaging speed are becoming more stringent as more advanced applications of imaging systems are considered. The adoption of imaging systems in new applications areas is often hampered by the lack of progress in addressing these two main issues. A common feature in a number of imaging systems is that they make use of arrays of spatially distributed micro sensors and actuators that are connected in a feedback configuration to a control system. Such systems are referred to as distributed microsystems. 



The proposed research has three long term goals that will address issues related to the accuracy, resolution, and speed of imaging systems based on distributed microsystems.  The first goal is the design and fabrication of high-performance arrays of micro sensors and actuators for the imaging systems of interest. The second goal is to develop general controller design and adaptation approaches for distributed microsystems with demanding performance requirements. The third goal involves the experimental evaluation of the performance of the developed sensors, actuators and control algorithms on two appropriate distributed microsystem test beds namely retinal imaging adaptive optics systems and  video-rate atomic force microscopy systems. 



The resulting retinal imaging adaptive optics systems will provide high resolution images of the retina tissue, allowing for the examination of the cellular structures in the tissue, early diagnosis of eye diseases, and the in-vivo study of the cellular processes in the retina tissue. The resulting atomic force microscopy systems will allow accurate imaging of sample surfaces at a frame rate of 30 frames/sec or higher, hence enabling, for example, the accurate and real-time study of biomolecular processes.

"The aim of this research project is to improve dynamic programming-based approximations for options pricing in low-, intermediate-, and high-dimensional state spaces.

Stochastic dynamic programming is a recursive method that usually requires an approximation of the Bellman value function at each step of the recursion. In the context of options valuing, the Bellman value function is the value of the option to be priced. The best approximation depends on the dimension of the state space and the dynamics of the (Markov) state process, among other specificities of the problem to be solved. Here, the optimal design is case sensitive.

Low- and high-dimensional dynamic programs for options pricing are relatively well documented in the literature. However, an additional effort in terms of efficiency improvement has to be done. Practical problems in option pricing often have intermediate dimensions in between two and five. Examples include affine term-structure models and multiple geometric Brownian motions. The literature on intermediate-dimensional dynamic programs for options pricing is sparse. Here, a significant effort has to be done, not only in terms of efficiency improvement, but also in terms of the design of new methods.

There are several ways to improve stochastic dynamic programs for options pricing:

1. Adapt and use the extensive literature on DP and/or Monte Carlo simulation and their applications in various specific fields; 2. Realize part of the experiment in a closed form; 3. Use more precise and possibly smoother interpolations of the Bellman value function at each decision date; 4. Search for the effective dimension of the Bellman equation and reduce the complexity of the problem to be solved; 5. Combine between reduction of variance techniques; 6. Couple between DP and quasi-Monte Carlo.","G�nie","Avancement des connaissances","Industrial Engineering",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The large variety and amounts of products available on the Internet have given rise to the need for decision support systems that can assist users in choosing the ""right"" products. The long-term research program focuses on improving the interfaces that facilitate the communication between decision-makers and web-based product Recommendation Agents (RAs) that provide assistance by eliciting the purchasing needs of decision-makers and making recommendations accordingly. The objective is to make RAs more personalized and understanding of users' needs, more flexible to use, and more transparent and trustworthy in order to increase their utilization in e-procurement. This will enhance the productivity of buyers, industrial workers and professionals by realizing the benefits of web-based procurement for themselves and their organizations.

   In addition to reducing information overload and improving procurement quality, the proposed program of studies is important for the following reasons. First, adoption of recommendation technology is still in its early stages. Surveys show that finding information about new sources of supply is the most important use of the Internet, therefore RAs would be especially valuable for individuals and firms purchasing products over the Internet. Second, practitioners have realized that the user interfaces to RAs are crucial to make it easy for buyers to discover new product content. As such, we aim to improve the input side of the interface between users and the RAs (e.g., how best does the RA elicit users' preferences of product attributes), and to enhance the output side of the interface (e.g., how an RA's advice be best presented to user). Third, users' trust is a key success factor for e-commerce and RA utilization. This project proposes new ways to enhance users' trust by making RAs' reasoning more transparent and credible to the users. Practitioners can benefit from this work by reengineering their RA interfaces both to gain competitive advantage and to make purchasing decision-making more effective.

"Understanding how changes in animal genomes permitted the evolution of the staggering diversity of life on earth is a major challenge in modern biology. Most of the differences between groups of animals represent variations in the embryonic developmental program. Understanding the relationship between changes in the structure and function of genes that regulate development and the resulting morphology is therefore key to understanding variations in body plans. Duplication of genes with subsequent divergence of the duplicated copies and their recruitment to new functions are thought to be key genomic contributions to increased morphological complexity and diversity. This is thought to have happened in a lineage of animals that evolved into the vertebrates (animals, like us, with backbones). Looking at animals alive today, we find that invertebrates like insects often have a single version of a particular gene, whereas humans and other vertebrates usually have multiple related (homologous) genes that carry out new and different functions depending upon where in the body they are active. We are studying the evolution of function in the Dlx family of regulatory genes to understand the relationships between changes in the expression and function of gene regulators and animal evolution. This work will improve our knowledge of the mechanisms that control animal development at the molecular level and also how these mechanisms have changed over evolutionary time. This is basic research that will have an impact on the fields of developmental, cell, and evolutionary biology at an international level.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"The field of statistical and computational machine learning has had impressive successes, offering rigorous tools for learning to predict labels of data, based on training samples.  Algorithmic paradigms like Support-Vector-Machines, Decision-Trees and Boosting grew from theoretical models into popular and vastly applicable software packages. Machine learning thus provides a resounding demonstration of the impact of theoretical analysis on the development of practical applications. However, many common applications of machine learning address scenarios that are more complex than what is modeled by the currently available mathematical theory. Consider, for example, medical research aimed to identify physiological markers that predict future development of dementia. Say the research took place in Denmark. Can one readily apply its conclusions to Canadian patients? Common learning methods for classification perform well when training and test data are drawn from the same population.  However, as the above example demonstrates, in many application this is not the case. Under which conditions, and how, can we adapt a classifier trained on some source domain to apply to a different target domain? To cope with such scenarios, learning practitioners have developed heuristics that, while apparently working reasonably well, are not supported by existing mathematical analysis. Can the success of theoretical analysis of machine learning be extended to such scenarios? The proposed research aims to provide mathematical support for such emerging machine learning and data mining heuristic paradigms that, while being widely applied, lack rigorous theoretical underpinnings. In a series of recent papers, with several students of mine, we have made pioneering steps in that direction.  Some examples of such work include: papers on popular model-selection heuristics for clustering (one of which awarded COLT Best Student Paper); a NIPS'06 paper on domain adaptation; a COLT08 paper on semi-supervised learning, and a NIPS'08 paper on the foundations of clustering. These papers, as well as related workshops that I have organized, are the start of an ambitious project that I will pursue with this grant.

"Managing the insect pest problem in Canadian forestry and agriculture is a key economic, health and environmental issue for Canada.  Replacing current chemical controls with more environmentally benign biological treatments is based on understanding the biology of the organism. For example, how do insects change from one form to another as they grow?  What controls how females produce eggs?  How do chemical signals from the brain control maturation and reproduction. What controls an insect's choice between staying in one location to feed or travel long distances. What controls the age of an organism? The answer to all of these questions is related, in part, to chemicals known as hormones. Specifically, juvenile hormone (JH) is responsible for keeping an insect in a young stage. If the amount of JH is high in an insect's blood, the insect will not change from one form to another (for instance, a caterpillar won't transform into a butterfly).  If JH is present in female adults, eggs will mature. The level of JH in the insect blood controls other insect behaviours, such as migration and aging. If we could understand all the steps that are required to change the level of JH in the insect blood, we could inhibit egg production in insect pests, leading towards an environmentally safe insect control agent. Training of high quality personnel in new alternative control strategies is vital to this cause.

    )	The aim of our laboratory has been to identify small proteins (allatostatins) made by the nervous system and understand how they control whether the amount of JH is high or low. Our work has shown that allatostatins are found in all invertebrates and have numerous functions apart from JH regulation. How  do allatostatins participate in numerous roles? We are using model genetic systems that allow us to inhibit/remove components of the pathway of allatostatin action and ask how this may affect behaviour, feeding reponses, growth and reproduction of the organism.

"The amount of electrical energy (voltage) which can be drawn from a solar cell is proportional to the number of photons absorbed (N), the quantum efficiency of converting those photons to electrical charge (QE) and inversely proportional to wavelength of the photons.  Therefore in order to increase the amount of voltage produced, an increase in N and/or QE or a reduction in the wavelength of the absorbed photons is needed.  This proposal seeks to increase N through broad spectral absorption of sunlight by subphthalocyanine (subPc) crystals either on their own or as a mixture with other subphthalocyanine or phthalocyanine crystals.  At the same time, the supramolecular arrangement of the new subPcs within the crystal will be studied in order to maximize QE.



The methodology used will lead by computer aided (in silico) design, followed by chemical synthesis and characterization of new subPc crystals.  These new crystals will be directly derived from the only known subPc compound - boron subphthalocyanine (B-subPc).  Once boron is used to template the synthesis of the subPc molecular scaffold, it will be chemically removed and sequestered, allowing for the metal free subphthalocyanine (H2-subPc) to complex with other metals including gallium, aluminum, indium, titanium and europium.



In order to produce a photo-voltage, a cascade of electron transfer events will need to be engineered and understood between the new subPcs and suitable electron-donating and electron-accepting materials across the indicated wavelengths.  Such understanding will be accomplished by molecular level characterization of the individual materials, studying their interaction with other materials present in the system and through actual construction of working organic solar cells.

"Agile software processes are becoming increasingly more popular due to their promise to ease the formal requirements on programmers and managers, thus accelerating the development, and at the same time maintain adequate quality of the software produced with it.

However, agile processes often fall short in two areas: software reuse and process reuse. Software produced with agile processes is not always reusable, because it is not documented very thoroughly. There exist techniques like refactoring that allow programmers to make software elements better understandable, so that they can be reused even though no separate documentation exists on them.

However, there are no techniques for process reuse. This is desirable because if a process has parts that can be reused, then it is possible to document these parts and train other employees to use them. This improves the uniformity of the software quality and is usually a good advantage to companies, effectively avoiding to ""reinvent the wheel"" over and over again.

Process reuse is also very important when considering process improvement. When a process is being improved, there is always a documented baseline to start from, which gives a company the ability to measure the increase in efficiency when using a new process as compared to the baseline.

This proposal describes the steps to achieve process reuse by automatically discovering usage patterns in a company. This allows processes to be documented and reused automatically, thus making it possible to accrue process documentation during process execution. After a process has concluded, similarities and patterns within the process are automatically presented and can be adopted throughout the company. This also allows one to discover similarities among different processes and make the best of these immediately.","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Commun.,Computers & Components",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan

"Speech enhancement plays a fundamental role in many applications such as teleconferencing systems, speech recognizers, human-machine interfaces, hands-free communications, mobile phones, and hearing aids. Indeed, the noise is around us and everywhere. So when a signal of interest (usually speech) is picked up by a microphone, it is always contaminated by noise, reverberation, and other undesired signals. The objective is then to clean up the noisy signal with digital signal processing tools without damaging much the desired speech signal.

The problem of speech enhancement is an old one and has been around for more than 40 years. This should not come as a surprise since, contrary to what some people may believe, it is a very difficult problem for mainly two reasons. First, the nature and characteristics of the noise signals can change dramatically in time and application to application. It is therefore laborious to find versatile algorithms that really work in different practical environments. Second, the performance measure can also be defined differently for each application. Two perceptual criteria are widely used to measure the performance: quality and intelligibility. While the former is subjective (it reflects individual preferences of listeners), the latter is objective (it gives the percentage of words that could be correctly identified by listeners). It is very hard to satisfy both at the same time.

So this research proposal aims at developing the next-generation speech enhancement algorithms with one and, especially, multiple microphones (or microphone arrays) with the clear objective to reduce the noise and other interference signals as much as possible with little (or no) distortion of the desired speech signal. In other words, we will try to improve the quality as much as possible without affecting the intelligibility. We will also try to develop practical algorithms that can be easy to use and easy to tune in the real world and for most applications. To achieve this goal, we will rely on some strong ideas and results we have developed recently.","Mat�riel de t�l�communications","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Electrical and Computer Engineering",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"Aquaculture is the world's fastest growing food production sector. In Canada, where capture fisheries have declined from historic highs in the late 1980s, aquaculture production has increased more than ten-fold in the last decade. Most of Canada's aquaculture production comes from salmon farmed in British Columbia and New Brunswick. However, salmon are not well suited for aquaculture in most of Atlantic Canada and salmon aquaculture as a whole has had difficulty remaining profitable in Canada. As a result, there is a concerted effort by industry and government to diversify aquaculture in Atlantic Canada. Atlantic cod is seen as a prime alternative aquaculture species for the region, and Atlantic Canada's largest aquaculture company (Cooke Aquaculture Inc.) has recently made significant investments into cod aquaculture. Their preliminary production trials have highlighted early maturation of production fish as a key constraint to commercial viability, because mature fish cease growing, have reduced flesh quality and have high mortality rates. This problem is compounded by the fact that cod will eadily spawn in cages, thereby potentially releasing large numbers of fertilized eggs into the wild. We propose to develop practical approaches for the production of single-sex populations of cod, in order to take advantage of sex-related differences in age  and size at maturity, and to link into a parallel research program currently underway on the production of triploid (sterile) cod. Our research will determine the genetic basis to sex determination in Atlantic cod and will lead to the development of treatment regimes for functional sex reversal in this species. The genetic mechanism of sex determination will be determined  y gynogenesis, whereby expression of the paternal genome in viable embryos is prevented and the maternal genome is duplicated. Examining sex ratios of the offspring from gynogenetic populations helps to identify the genetic basis of sex determination and informs the decision on best approaches for producing single-sex populations. Endocrine sex reversal will then be used to create broodstock capable of generating single-sex progeny. Two graduate students will be funded to conduct this research.",Aquiculture,"Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","New Brunswick",Nouveau-Brunswick

New artificial intelligence algorithms called deep architectures were recently proposed in the machine learning community that have the potential to extract meaningful representations from vast amounts of data such as the images in the web and music collections.  A meaningful representation for an image is one that captures what humans care about, e.g., what are the objects in it, but is not too sensitive to changes due to factors such as position, illumination, scale, etc. Similarly, meaningful representations of music separate factors such as timbre from the melodic content and other factors involved. 



The proposed equipment will significantly boost the research program of the U. Montreal machine learning laboratory (www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa) in the area of unsupervised learning of representations using these new algorithms, in particular for images and music. Whereas current computers are too slow for large-scale implementation of these algorithms, even with large computer clusters, the proposed equipment promises 10-fold to 100-fold speed-ups in training time thanks to the advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) exploited as general-purpose parallel computing devices. A recent paper from Stanford university on the potential of GPUs in this domain states that they have the ""potential to revolutionize the applicability of deep unsupervised learning methods"" and most labs investigating these techniques are now developing their algorithms with GPUs.","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computer Science",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Web services such as search engines rely on the interpretation of the content of Web pages: text, images, video. Those services could be drastically improved if we could improve the ability of computers to disambiguate words in their context, to interpret images in Web pages, or to correctly associate a document and an image. To analyze and compare words, sentences, documents, images and video, while better taking into account their meaning, their raw digital forms can be transformed into new representations. Many machine learning algorithms have been developed around the world to learn such representations. Among these algorithms, much attention has recently been devoted to so-called deep architectures, which decompose the problem into a series of transformations, from low-level features to higher-level features.  The proposed research program focusses on overcoming current limitations of these algorithms and on taking advantage of huge datasets. Such datasets may be those currently available from the Web, or be automatically synthetized so as to illustrate different levels of abstraction about text and images not available explicitly from Web data. It is proposed to guide the training of machines to capture these abstractions. This will be achieved by taking advantage of the fact that higher-level features tend to remain for many consecutive sentences or images, and also taking inspiration from human and animal learning to order examples in a structured curriculum.

"Machine learning algorithms attempt to endow machines with the ability to capture  knowledge through examples, e.g., allowing a machine to classify or predict correctly in new cases. Machine learning research has been extremely successful in the past two decades and is now applied in many areas of science and technology, a well known example being web search engines. Yet, machines still seem to fall short of even mammal-level intelligence in many respects. One of the remaining frontiers of machine learning is the difficulty of learning the kind of complicated and highly-varying functions that are necessary to perform machine vision or natural language processing tasks at a level comparable to humans. Deep learning methods aim at learning of hierarchies of concepts, with concepts from higher-levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level ones.  Automatically learning features at multiple levels of abstraction allows a system to learn complex functions mapping the input to the output directly from data. This is especially important for higher-level abstractions, which humans often do not know how to specify explicitly. Although theory suggests that deep architectures, which are found in the brain, could be very important for AI, they come with a difficult optimization challenge, which is the subject of the proposed research. It is encouraging to note that animals and humans apply sub-optimal but wholly adequate strategies towards this optimization difficulty, and we will seek inspiration from the natural world in this research. We propose hypotheses to explain this difficulty and the success of the methods recently introduced, along with experiments to help us understand this optimization difficulty, and new algorithms to improve the training of deep architectures on large datasets involving only few human-labeled examples.

"The importance of 3D object recognition is increasing rapidly in the field of computer graphics and multimedia communication due to the difficulty in processing information efficiently without its recognition. 3D objects consist of geometric and topological information, and their compact representation is an important step towards a variety of computer vision and graphics applications. One of the key mathematical tools used to study the topology of 3D objects is Morse theory, which studies the relationship between functions on a space and the shape of the space. 



The proposed Morse-theoretic framework aims to represent a 3D object with an invariant multiresolution skeleton graph to capture important structural object information using a mixture distance function. The key idea is to identify and encode regions of topological interest of a 3D object. The main motivations behind using the proposed approach are: (a) rotational invariance of the distance function makes it more adapted to object recognition than the Morse height function, and (b) we can show that a surface may be reconstructed from its intersections with concentric super-ellipsoids centered at the barycenter of the underlying surface. The topological changes occur as we change the level values of these concentric super-ellipsoids. 



In this research proposal, we will benefit form the studies performed during the past 3-year funding period to develop a Morse-theoretic framework for topological modeling of 3D objects, and to take advantage of the latter to develop a theoretically rigorous and computationally feasible methodology for 3D object recognition, retrieval, animation, and watermarking. In the course of developing our algorithmic tools, we believe it is necessary to investigate this promising Morse-theoretic formalism and provide in the process a more thorough and clear analysis framework.","Syst�mes d'information et technologie de l'information","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computing and Information Sciences - B",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Six researchers in the Dept, Psychology at Queen's Univ. depend on a functioning animal care facility to carry out their NSERC-funded research. The current facility includes a cage washer that is 40 yr old and needs to be replaced. We are requesting a grant to assist in covering the cost of purchasing a new cage washer. The research programs of the NSERC-funded professors include:  RJ Beninger who studies the role of brain neurotransmitters in the control of behavior in rats; H Dringenberg who studies neuronal plasticity in brain recording studies in rats; B Frost who uses single cell recording techniques in pigeons to study the visual system; J Menard who evaluates the neural circuitry of fear in rats; MC Olmstead who investigates how cognitive and motivational processes interact to influence behavior in rats; and N Troje, a NSERC Steacie Fellow whose research focuses on biological motion using pigeons. These research programs depend critically on the availability of a functioning cage washer to provide a hygienic housing environment for the animals. Similar equipment is available in two other facilities at Queen's but movement between facilities is discouraged to prevent the spread of pathogens. Moving the six researchers and their labs to another building where they would have direct access to a cage washer is not feasible because of space limitations and such a move would fracture the Dept. Psychology. The six NSERC-funded researchers currently supervise 18 undergraduate and 21 graduate students and one postdoc. Additional undergraduate students in Psychology take courses that use lab animals. All of these highly qualified personnel rely on a functioning cage washer to be able to complete their studies. The findings from the research carried out by the investigators who rely on the cage washer have wide ranging influence on many aspects of day-to-day life including understanding and treating brain disorders such as drug addiction and developing technologies such as more effective tail-light displays in vehicles to prevent collisions and understanding why teleconferencing systems are not more widely used.

Problems of computing a set of locations to optimize a given objective have been studied in logistics and industrial engineering already. The goal in such a context is to locate facilities to provide equitable service to clients, to minimize the transportation cost, or to capture the largest market share.  However, the performance of wireless networks depends on specific factors, such as interference and radio propagation, not considered relevant for industrial operations. This research proposes to design and solve location problems that accurately reflect the behaviour of wireless networks in order to better support the planning decisions of service providers.","Technologie de l'information, des ordinateurs et des r�seaux de communications","Avancement des connaissances","Computing and Information Sciences - A",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta
"Context-aware mobile learning is an important requirement for next generation intelligent e-learning systems. However, context-management in real world applications is a complex information processing task. In this research program, context reflects timeliness and mobility to nurture pervasive learning throughout an enterprise ecosystem. The aim is to dynamically provide useful learning resources on demand, anywhere, in a learner-driven context and on a learner's schedule. This is particularly important for corporate learning providers in order to make it possible for organizations to transform learning into a strategic lever. As learning material scale up and longer instruction times become common, knowledge acquisition become time-dependent and is increasingly acquired on the fly due to considerable changes in today's know-how economy requirements. However, the process of inferring, communicating, and presenting context-aware learning resources to mobile learners poses new challenges to the research community. This is mainly due to the limitations of mobile technology (i.e. limited bandwidth on wireless networks, and limited resources on mobile devices), and to the lack of cognitive mobile-learning models (i.e. problems related to domain-knowledge representation and contextual information retrieval, time constrained instruction, and human-computer interaction). This research program contributes towards solving some of the challenging problems in cognitive mobile-learning by making use of the progress in Semantic Web theory, e-learning standardization, and mobile computing. The approach is to develop a knowledge-centered framework based on ontological formulation that structures knowledge into meaningful content and creates an environment where software agents roaming around peer-to-peer learning object repositories can readily carry out sophisticated learning services discovery and compositions. The use of ontology aims at providing customized learning patterns which are delivered on-demand to the learner and/or combined with other patterns to form a self-adjusted learning route according to the learner's needs and available learning time.

"The equipment requested is a nanofiber electrospinning unit capable of fabricating solid and hollow piezoelectric fibers with a diameter of 50 nm to 800 nm. Piezoelectric nano fibers are promising for the development of micro energy harvesting systems that offer a high power/volume density due to the nanofiber high surface to volume ratio and significantly better mechanical properties such as better flexibility and higher tensile strength as compared to bulk Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) ceramics that are typically used in power harvesting applications. The micro energy harvesters are able to convert environmental vibration caused by wind, vibration in rotating machinery, vibration in buildings and bridges, and even vibration induced by the various functions within the human body (e.g., heart beat, breathing and walking) into electrical energy to power low-power wireless electronic devices such as implanted medical devices (e.g., pace makers) and hand held portable electronic devices such as mobile phone handsets, PDAs and MP3 players. The dominant power source for most wireless electronic devices is currently standard and rechargeable batteries. Drawbacks of battery powered systems include limited energy supply, the need for battery maintenance and replacement and most importantly adverse effects on the environment upon disposal of hundred of millions of batteries. Most batteries are non-recyclable and not bio-degradable. The piezoelectric nanofiber energy harvesting technology provides an alternative clean and renewable power source, i.e., environmental vibration, to power low-power wireless electronics. The applicants are pursuing the development of high density energy harvesting technology and a number of students and researchers are already pursuing it. Such a program will significantly benefit from the nanofiber electrospinning unit.

"Global demand for better fuel economy, low engine emissions, and better vehicle response speed require engine manufacturers to continue to seek better combustion systems. In the past decade, the common rail direct fuel injection technology in engines which features a high-pressure fuel rail and electric controls of individual valves led to a significant improvement in emissions, fuel consumption and power density. The key constituent of the common rail system is the fuel injector. A conventional direct fuel injector uses a solenoid coil that drives a valve to move the injector needle through a hydraulic circuit. The solenoid actuator cannot meet stringent future emission requirements (US 2012, Euro 6). Piezoelectric fuel injectors are gradually replacing the solenoid injectors and typically consist of a multi-layer piezoelectric stack actuator acting on a nozzle with a speed 4~5 times faster than its solenoid counterpart. Current piezoelectric engine fuel injectors use a

hydraulic circuit to amplify the stroke of the piezo stack. The mechanism complicates the injection system and lowers the stiffness of the injector and thus limits its response speed. Development efforts being done by manufacturers such as Bosch and Denso are also focused on the use of amplification mechanisms to extend the stroke of the actuators which limits the speed of response. In this project, a direct mechanical acting piezoelectric fuel injection technology will be developed, which will be based on a novel large stroke compact multi-stack piezoelectric actuator with the injection nozzle needle directly connected to the actuator without using a hydraulic or amplification mechanism. The new actuator will be developed so as it also offers self-sensing capability and temperature compensation in order to enhance the control of the fueling process. Variations of this actuator platform will be implemented to develop piezo injectors for gasoline, diesel and natural gas engines. Design and fabrication of the piezo actuators and injectors and their integration into instrumented engine cells will be pursued. This improved combustion control will lead to a further reduction in emissions, higher torque and improved fuel economy.","Machinerie m�canique, machinerie lourde (y compris machinerie agricole, foresti�re, de construction)","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario
"The research program is motivated by many industrial applications that require the development of novel actuator concepts and their use in developing multi-axis positioners offering nanometer accuracy, Micro Electro Mechanical Systems for wireless applications, and micro actuators for dispensing and fluid manipulation tasks in biomedical testing. Specifically, the program focuses on three main tasks and is based on major contributions developed within the research group:

1.Based on research done by the group on piezoceramic (PZT) characterization and linear motor design, the research will establish real-time compensation algorithms for non-linear effects in PZT actuators for applications in the KHz frequency range and develop novel designs of PZT actuated linear positioners offering nanometer accuracy. 

2.Activities within the group in the area of microfluidics led to developing novel micropumps, dispensing arrays and mixing chambers. Future work will pursue developing a microfluidic development and testing infrastructure that facilitates the integration of micro-machining technology, micro actuation/sensing and microhydraulic concepts to develop lab-on-a-chip devices that integrate the critical microfluidic components needed for various fluid handling protocols and the production of high-density DNA and protein slides. This includes developing an understanding of PZT thin film actuators and their integration into MEMS devices, and developing high precision (picoliter range) dispensing heads using thin film PZT and electrostatic actuators.

3.The research group has developed a novel two-layer bi-directional MEMS electrostatic actuator that offers a stroke that is 5 times higher than conventional actuators. The novel actuator can be fabricated using standard micromachining processes. Future work will focus on establishing designs, fabrication and packaging of high performance RF MEMS tunable capacitors for next generation wireless communication systems based on the developed actuator platform.

"The funding will be used to investigate the plate tectonic processes that were responsible for the formation of continents, in Late Archean time, ca. 2700 million years ago. The focus will be on the southern Superior tectonic province, in Ontario and Quebec. That region preserves a very large and complete rock record of Archean tectonics. It is also one of the most important reservoirs of mineral resources in Canada. The study will include extensive geological field work and map-making. The field work will be complemented by cutting age mineral-dating techniques and by calculations of the pressures (depths) and temperatures at which the rocks formed. Experimental studies of tectonic processes and tectonic structures will also complement the field-based studies. The experiments will be of two types, numerical and analog (scaled models composed of physical materials).

"Humanity depends on the services provided by ecosystems, such as food, flood control, and places to recreate. Management that attempts to maximize provision of one ecosystem service (ES) may make ecosystems vulnerable to declines in other ES. For this reason, recent studies have called for increased attention to co-managing multiple ES. However, this is impeded by an inadequate understanding of the multiple, non-linear interactions among ES and the slowly changing variables that appear to regulate these interactions. In fact, many uncertainties in ecosystem management are rooted in a lack of fundamental, empirically grounded understanding about the relationship between ecosystem change and the provision of multiple ES. The goal of my research program is to advance theory about the interactions among ES by studying long-term change in two ES (agricultural production and water quality), their drivers (land use and management), and the slowly changing variables that ultimately control system dynamics (soil P concentration and holding capacity). 

The food-water system is ideal for studying ES interactions. It is well-quantified; however, most research has focused on immediate problem of minimizing P loss from fertilizers and manures. This ignores a potentially much larger and sustained problem - the long-term fate of P stored in watershed soils. Much P applied in fertilizers is not taken up by plants or lost to water, but is retained in the soil, increasing the chance of freshwater eutrophication and thereby reducing provision of freshwater ES. Soil P concentrations change slowly. Thus, P accumulation may set the stage for decades of impaired water quality. Soil P research has generated novel insights into the controls of runoff; however, the focus tends to be on small watersheds, and may overlook interactions that are critical at larger scales. My broad-scale research will be valuable for improving management of agricultural production and water quality together, as well as for developing novel regional-scale methodologies to address the interactions among ES and extending our knowledge of the basic science behind the processes that drive eutrophication.

"Number theory, one of the oldest branches of mathematics, has enjoyed a renaissance in recent years. On one hand, the remarkable proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles has reaffirmed Number theory's position as a central one in modern mathematics. On the other, numerous and striking applications to such diverse problems as data encryption and signal transmission have demonstrated the utility of the field, both for industrial and governmental purposes. 



One of the fundamental problems in Number  theory is that of determining the number and distribution of integral or rational points upon curves of positive genus. In the project at hand, the investigator studies a number of related questions in the subfield of Diophantine equations, including some stemming from work of Wiles. The techniques employed allow the complete resolution of a number of classic problems in this area. These equations are connected to the theory of error-correcting codes which, in turn, are of crucial importance to, for example, data processing from satellites, cd and dvd players, cell phones and smart cards.

"Every day, we are faced with the task of detecting and recognizing hundreds of faces. We need to pick faces out of the background clutter of our environments, and we need to identify who are friends, and who are strangers, so that we can interact with people appropriately. Although the perception of faces appears automatic and effortless to us, the perception of faces can be quite complex, and much remains to be learned about how our brains process faces. Previous research from my lab shows that people are relatively inefficient at discriminating faces, and that people seem to use relatively local parts of a face for recognition and discrimination. However, our previous research used quite limited numbers of stimuli, and it is not clear whether our conclusions will generalize to face processing in more naturalistic environments. The current proposal aims to combine the rigorous psychophysical approach that we have used to study visual processes in the past, with increased complexity of facial stimuli, with the goal of determining the extent to which simple models of vision can account for face processing, and at what levels of complexity the appropriateness of those models breaks down. The studies will also examine the perceptual mechanisms underlying the relatively understudied field of face detection, as well as providing a more direct examination of the potential role of configural processing in face perception. The results of this program of research will lead to an increased understanding of how the brain processes visual information, especially information about faces, and may lead to important constraints in both biological models of perception and models in computational vision.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Chemical pulp production is a major resource-based Canadian industry that continues to struggle with increased global competition, a fluctuating Canadian dollar and aging infrastructure. To improve the competitive position of the industry, improvement and innovation in pulping processes must be achieved and a reduction in manufacturing costs realized. The projects described in this research proposal aim to reduce chemical use in pulping and bleaching operations and improve product uniformity and quality (creating marketing opportunities and the possibility of increased production), as well as look to future possibilities in the industry. Three projects are proposed: The first is to determine how mixing processes impact the production and properties of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) which is being studied as a source of novel and value-added products from pulp fibre. Mixing and reaction engineering can influence generation of the nano-scale products, and the work proposed will examine this in the context of NCC generation and properties. The second project will examine the production of polysulfide, a chemical additive shown to markedly improve pulp yield when present in the cooking liquor. We will develop a reaction engineering model for polysulfide generation (which will include relevant mass transfer processes and new kinetic information) as a tool for reactor design and optimization. The work will also be extended to examine existing pulp liquor oxidation processes (particularly white liquor oxidation). Finally, our ongoing work examining macroscale mixing of pulp suspensions has identified several opportunities worth pursuing, including mixing and flow in two industrially important mixer configurations. The experimental techniques developed in our research group will be applied to these mixer configurations.

"To fully understand the relationship between soft-tissue adaptations in human joints and joint loading, the mechanical state of all joint tissues for normal, everyday movement tasks must be known (Herzog et al., 2003). These everyday tasks depend on the modulation of joint stability and stiffness by our neuromuscular control system which determines muscle activation and controls limb motion. There is, however, a significant void in the literature describing the role of individual muscles in generating the forces needed to create this stability, even though it is generally accepted that muscles play the leading role in maintaining it and modulating joint stiffness to allow for human movement. 

My goal is to fill this void by exploring the link between neuromuscular control and joint loading in order to elucidate how the human system controls lower limb stability through muscle activations, how these muscle activations alter joint forces, and how joint forces load the soft tissues of the knee joint. Once this has been established, I will explore the plasticity of this control system to determine whether or not voluntary muscle activation can be used (through targeted training) to alter joint stability and stiffness. By doing so we could theoretically alter internal joint and soft-tissue loading and limb control, potentially allowing us to modify tissue adaptation. This research will have applications in the fields of humanoid robotics, biomedical engineering, neurosciences and health sciences. 

My research program has complimentary in vivo and in vitro research streams. I will use electromyography- (EMG; a measure of muscle activation) driven muscle modeling during isometric (static) (Phase-1) and dynamic (Phase-2) tasks to estimate muscle forces in vivo. These force estimates will be integrated into an in vitro cadaveric testing jig to determine intra-articular pressure and force distribution at the knee joint. The model and complimentary in vitro measures will be validated under isometric conditions prior to progressing tothe dynamic conditions due to the increased complexity of modeling dynamic muscle contractions.

"Grid computing is a type of distributed system that enables the sharing, selection, and aggregation of distributed resources and services in order to tackle large-scale problems in different fields: science,  business, etc... Grid computing aims at providing reliable approaches and secure environments to computing and problem solving based on collaboration by bringing resources together. To achieve the full potential of this emerging technology, grid computing is increasingly perceived to be equipped with semantic information about resources, services, customers, providers, etc... In the modern research into this domain, the focus is not only on networked and high performance computing infrastructure, but also on information handling and support for knowledge. Thus, semantic grid computing emerges as an extension of the current grid. 

    This research program proposes to use multi-agent systems to develop advanced semantic grid applications such as e-business and e-science. This presents new challenges that are not yet rigorously addressed. Particularly challenging problems are the engineering of flexibility, verifiability, and security of semantic grid applications. The main objective of this research is to propose a new formal model and a computational framework for specifying and developing flexible, verifiable, and secure grid computing. This is of paramount importance for e-applications. The methodology is based on the use of multi-agent techniques particularly, logic and argumentation-based agents, and extended verification and security techniques adapted to grid architecture. At the architectural level, we propose to investigate a service-oriented view of the grid. This view is based upon the notion of various entities providing services to one another under various forms of contract. The idea, ultimately, is to bridge the chasm between current practice in developing systems and the sophisticated insights of the modern research into web services, multi-agent systems, and semantic grid computing. The challenges motivated here squarely addresses the scientific and engineering foundations of semantic-grid computing.

"Petroleum reservoirs typically produce a mixture of petroleum hydrocarbons and saline water. Co-produced

saline water is generally disposed of by injection into appropriate geologic formations. However, due to legacy

contamination, accidental spills or pipeline breaks, salt-affected soils are perhaps the single most common

environmental problem faced by the hydrocarbon industry. High soil salinity can cause a loss of crop

productivity or plant death. In addition, the sodium in salt can cause sodic conditions which are characterized

by poor soil structure, reduced permeability, the formation of hard crusts when dry and susceptibility to

erosion. Additionally, the migration of saline water poses a risk to domestic use aquifers, livestock water

sources, freshwater bodies and other environmentally sensitive receptors. Remediating salt-affected soil and

groundwater is particularly challenging, because salt is not biodegradable.

The objective of this project is to comprehensively evaluate the performance of two systems for remediating

salt-affected soil, to develop remediation system design criteria, to develop methods for accelerating the

remediation of salt-affected soils and to investigate the risk assessment implications of the results. The field

trials will be conducted at sites provided by Imperial Oil Resources. As well as monitoring and evaluating the

performance of the entire sites, we will conduct experiments to accelerate the leaching of salts from the soil

column. The fate and transport of salt will be numerically modeled in order to test our hypotheses about the

physics and chemistry that control salt transport, to have the ability to project our findings to other sites and to

evaluate risk-based closure criteria. In contrast to other studies of tile drains and salt-affected soils and

groundwater, this study will be conducted in the Canadian climactic and geologic context. The end goal is to

understand the factors controlling the performance of the remediation systems, to evaluate whether these

collection systems can produce the desired remediation objectives within a reasonable time frame, to explore

methods for accelerating the desired results and to optimize their design and operation.",Environnement,"D�veloppement du nord","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Alberta,Alberta
"In order to manage groundwater resources and to remediate contaminated sites we need to characterize the distribution of geologic materials and the chemistry of soil and groundwater. However, the subsurface at many natural and contaminated sites is quite variable, and, because it is below the surface, quite difficult to characterize. Drilling boreholes has historically been the main tool for hydrogeologic site characterization. However, borehole data is located at a limited number of subsurface profiles and drilling is intrusive so it must be done with care at contaminated sites. The sparseness of the sampling can lead to an ambiguous or incorrect understanding of the subsurface. On the other hand, geophysical data can provide relatively inexpensive data that samples a much more continuous region of the subsurface. Often, geophysical data can be correlated to geologic formations, water quality and groundwater flow. Consequently, geophysical data has the potential to provide spatially dense information that can be used to dramatically improve our understanding of the subsurface. Indeed, geometrically complex sites cannot be properly characterized without spatially dense information and geophysical data can add information that allows reliable interpretations that are impossible with borehole data alone. The objective of this study is to develop practical methods for using multiple geophysical methods to improve our ability to characterize the subsurface. In particular, we are trying to take new, advanced methods that have been proposed in the research literature and make them effective for the real world consulting environment.

"This project is directly aimed at improving the ability of structural engineers in Canada and around the world to understand the way that structures behave and to allow them to improve their structures.  Currently there is no simple or practical way to determine how a reinforced concrete structure will respond to extreme loads if they result in dramatic changes to structural stiffness or structural topology and thus the engineer must rely on intuition and experience to answer collapse-related questions.  The results of this research project will allow a number of collapse related questions to be realistically and practically answered for the first time.



The objectives of this proposed research will be to complete the development of a new finite element modelling framework that can perform general nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete framed and shell structures.  These new finite elements will allow a number of currently ignored, but reasonably well known structural effects to be included in design such as member elongation due to flexure, shear deformations, short shear span behaviour, and better modelling of flexural and shear redistribution effects.  Each of these can be important when a building approaches structural collapse as the structure will find alternate load paths that are not available during regular loading.  The modelling framework will also allow more rigorous connections of walls with frame based structures and implicitly will allow the integration of a number of currently topical research areas such as self-centering systems and the size effect in shear.  



Based on this project, it will become possible for the first time to specifically design a structure in a way that takes these various behavioural effects into consideration and thus it will be possible to produce a more resilient structure.  It will thus allow less expensive buildings and bridges to be built while at the same time having them be more resistant to damage either accidental or intentional.

"My research program uses a variety of methods to examine the intraspecific biodiversity of freshwater and marine fishes, especially those that occur in Atlantic Canada. We use DNA sequencing of mitochondrial DNA to learn about historical components of diversity - for example, to trace contemporary populations back to the glacial refugia they occupied during the ice ages. We study more rapidly evolving sequences, called microsatellites, to measure the extent to which species are split into populations now, how much mixing or dispersal goes on between populations, and to determine how much genetic variation exists within populations. We study particular genes in fishes to determine if they show local adaptations. We study body morphology to examine how populations differ in their ecological adaptations. We use common garden experiments to test whether local populations of fishes show differences in their adaptations, for example, in their ability to withstand common environmental stresses such as acidity (low pH), and also to test whether the amount of inbreeding within populations affects the ability of fish to tolerate stresses such as low pH. We study a variety of fish species, including but not limited to rainbow smelt, lake whitefish, wolffishes, and American shad.

I study intraspecific biodiversity to gain valuable fundamental knowledge, but also because it is important for conservation reasons. As a northern country, much of which was covered by glaciers during the ice ages, Canada has relatively few species compared to warmer unglaciated parts of the world, but its species are divided into a myriad of populations, and these populations are often quite diverse. This diversity within species is a substantial part of the total biodiversity in Canada and elsewhere. It is important to recognize diversity within species, because understanding intraspecific biodiversity is an essential first step towards conserving it. It is important to conserve intraspecific biodiversity, because it contributes to the functioning of ecosystems, is part of our natural legacy, and provides the reservoir of variation that allows species to adapt to future environmental changes.

"With an ever-increasing emphasis on e-commerce and the importance of negotiation to market transactions, there is a present and growing need for effective systems to enable negotiation in online transactions.  When properly designed, e-negotiation systems should lower the costs associated with negotiation in the e-marketplace, reduce resistance by market participants to computer-mediated negotiation, and foster the emergence of better agreements. Yet, despite the great promise of e-negotiation, the design of these systems has always lacked a systematic, traceable and reproducible approach. Consequently, most e-negotiation systems today implement a single negotiation protocol, which is usually hard-coded into the system. In order for e-negotiation systems to fulfill their promise, a structured approach is needed in conjunction with a configurable framework for their design, development, and deployment. A core requirement for this approach and framework must be a separation of the negotiation protocol from the system that implements it, thus requiring protocols to be formally specified via shared languages. Other critical requirements for the approach and framework include: configurability, standardized tools, generic components to enable customization and reuse, cost and process efficiency, and rapid and easy deployment and testing. The resulting systems should be web-based, easy to use and personalize, affordable, traceable, reliable, secure, scalable, efficient, and open to integration with other information systems. This research project seeks to develop such an approach and framework using a model-driven service oriented methodology, and to leverage web service orchestration techniques and languages for modeling negotiation processes.","Syst�mes d'information et technologie de l'information","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computing and Information Sciences - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"L'industrie mini�re canadienne engendre des quantit�s importantes de divers rejets plus ou moins probl�matiques, qu'il convient de g�rer convenablement afin de prot�ger l'environnement.

"The proposed research program is in Theoretical Computer Science.  It is mainly concerned with the design and analysis of algorithms, and here, in particular,  randomized algorithms, and algorithms for dynamic systems (like dynamic load balancing processes and dynamic routing problems in networks).



The main goals of this program are (i) to apply formal methods and techniques to real-world problems, e.g., in Networking (computer-related or otherwise), or in Biology, in a rigorous way, and(ii) to advance the formal (i.e., mathematical) methods and techniques used to study these models.  



One main vehicle that is going to be used is that of randomized algorithms and their probabilistic analysis, or sometimes ``just'' the probabilistic analysis of structures used to model certain phenomena/scenarios.

Randomized algorithms are typically a very elegant and efficient way of solving problems that would otherwise be very hard (or even impossible) to solve.  An example would be Property Testing, which is about devising and analyzing algorithms that verify whether or not a certain object (e.g., a database, or a DNA string) has a certain property. Randomized algorithms can do that in time that is sub-linear in the size of the object, i.e., even without looking at all parts of the object (one must allow for a certain error probability though).

"The research outlined in this proposal is aimed at controlling the physical and chemical properties of metal ions in compounds. Compounds of the lanthanide metals are the main focus of this work because they offer important advantages over other metals including higher reactivity, different selectivity, moderate cost and desirable electronic and nuclear properties. In spite of these factors, lanthanide chemistry has been slow to develop, partly because these metals require special coordination environments to form reactive compounds. In catalysis, for example, a fine balance must be achieved between formation of stable, isolable compounds and metal centres with sufficient reactivity to carry out useful chemical transformations. The development of new coordination environments for the lanthanides that forms the basis of this proposal is therefore critical to the practical implementation of these metals. The new coordination systems described here are designed to achieve two different purposes: (i) improved catalytic activity and selectivity in C-C bond forming reactions in water and organic solvents, and (ii) water and air stable complexes with pharmaceutical applications in medical imaging (magnetic resonance, gamma imaging, fluorescence imaging) or therapy (radio-lanthanide complexes as targeted anti-cancer drugs). A second major project, involves using metal coordination to improve the photochemical switching of organic molecules between different states with potential application in optical data storage. In all cases, success in achieving the desired reactivity or properties rests with careful design of the metal coordination environment.","Sciences physiques","Avancement des connaissances","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

Dynamical systems provide fundamental models and powerful tools for many applied sciences. Due to the ever-expanding scope of dynamics, quantitative and computational aspects now constitute a vibrant research area. Within this area, the proposed research program will 



(i) develop a comprehensive theory of Benford's Law in the context of dynamical systems; 

(Benford's Law is a well-documented empirical observation stating a particular distribution of significant digits in numerical data; while its important and surprising implications, e.g. in numerical analysis and statistics, have recently attracted a lot of attention, many natural mathematical questions concerning Benford's Law are still open.)



(ii) study finite data sets and dynamically relevant measures by means of a novel approach to constrained quantization; 



(iii) introduce and study fundamental concepts and tools for finite-time dynamics, e.g. hyperbolicity and spectrum, and apply them to nonautonomous bifurcations and driven billiards. 



Overall, the program will bring about a deepened understanding of important quantitative aspects of dynamical systems, leading in turn to more reliable statistical tests and plausibility checks (e.g. for accounting and election fraud) as well as improved numerical procedures wherever dynamical systems serve as models for real-world processes.

"In this program, we will investigate three problems. Genomes of different species often share many genes, but these may occur in different orders in the genome sequence. Based on the principle that any two species share a common ancestor, the question of how to reconstruct the evolution of one genome into another, based on gene orders, have been studied intensively in recent years. One of the lingering problems is the difficulty of discriminating between the multitude of different evolution scenarios that are proposed by the current models. Based on previous results, we plan to find new answers by studying properties of special graphs associated to genome comparisons. In addition to this long term goal, we plan to rapidly develop  software tools that can aid the construction of evolution scenarios.



Our second problem is to develop algorithms to characterize all RNA molecules that are present in a cell at a given time. Recent technology allows us to easily get partial information on these molecules, but there is still a lack of software tools that can transform this data into sound results. Recently, we designed theoretical models that showed the limits of these approaches. Our next goal is to construct software tools that can deal with real situations.



Our third goal is somewhat a mix of the first two, and probably the most challenging. In metagenomics surveys, many species are sequenced together because they live in the same environment, or are closely related species. We plan to generalize the approaches developed to characterize RNA molecules in the cell  to this more complex problem, where rearrangements between close species will be identified.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Computing and Information Sciences - B",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"A relatively  new phenomenon in mathematical research (on its long historical scale) is the introduction of computer algebra environments furnishing its traditionally purely theoretical  approach with an analog of the experimental laboratories of other scientific fields. In the new generation of mathematicians, this is rapidly becoming an essential component of their day to day research tools. It allows them to refine potential avenues of research, elaborate proof strategies, and check out their general understanding of the theoretical problems studied. 

In the last decades our group has been at the forefront of such uses, incidentally helping many new researchers to learn how to best exploit these techniques, as well as occasionally contributing to the development of specialized packages for such systems. All this has been mainly in areas lying at the crossroad of Algebra and Combinatorics, with special emphasis on Finite Group Representation Theory, Symmetric Functions, Formal Power Series, and Combinatorics of Words. Essentially all of our theoretical work has relies heavily on background experiments with the objects considered, and these experiments are essential to the theoretical advances made.

The purpose of this proposal is to renew our main computational need, and to start setting up a truly modern and powerful experimental laboratory to support our theoretical research. Up to now, we have been relying on mid-range workstations (all rapidly becoming obsolete), but we now feel the pressure to pass to more powerful environments. This push comes from the internal needs of our research, which relies more and more on intricate formal calculations such as: calculation of algebraic basis of spaces of multivariate polynomials, explicit decomposition of representation of algebras, etc. But it is also essential to keep us giving an up to date formation in the area to our students and postdoctoral fellows.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Mathematics and Statistics",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"My proposal concerns the study of certain algebraic spaces whose description and properties are established 

through the study of interesting combinatorial structures. A typical (and still very actively studied) set of 

examples consist in describing explicit decompositions of important representations of finite groups into 

irreducible representations. This is of crucial importance in many fields going from theoretical physics to 

algebraic geometry, and it naturally involves a deep combinatorial understanding of certain combinatorial 

structures, namely: Young Tableaux. Among the current fundamental problems in the area, lies a better 

understanding of Macdonald polynomials; and our combinatorial approach has already established numerous 

new results and revealed new avenues of research. Our approach goes through the study of certain spaces of n variable polynomials  characterized as solution sets of a family of partial differential equations. In particular these polynomials are  harmonic or diagonnaly harmonic. Several important generalizations are considered, and their description give  rise to new interesting formulas involving symmetric functions.  A recent addition to my areas of research concerns an entirely new combinatorial classification of the space of  complex polynomials in term of the structure of the pair of real plane algebraic curves.

"Often, discrete structures can be combined to create more complicated structures, or decomposed into simpler components. One way to algebraically model this is via multiplication and comultiplication operations. This naturally leads to the notion of combinatorial Hopf algebra. 

In this proposal we plan to investigate further combinatorial Hopf algebras and more particularly the invariants and coinvariants associated with them. In the process, we shall link together results in the different fields of theoretical physics, polytope theory, geometry and algebraic combinatorics. We shall also investigate recent conjectures we have on symmetric functions and their analogous results in non-commutative symmetric functions.

Most of our discoveries are found after inspection of data generated using Groebner basis methods, symbolic manipulation and linear algebra algorithms. Very powerful computers are used to generate our data and to display it graphically in ways that allow us to interpret their properties.

"The long-term objective of the research program is to improve our understanding of the fluvial forms and processes controlling the winter habitat of stream salmonid. Gravel-bed rivers can often be segmented into a number of discrete sedimentary links, each characterized by a node of coarse sediment recruitment followed by a gradual downstream fining of substrate and an associated reduction of channel slope. Because the downstream changes in substrate and slope along sedimentary links are associated with changes in channel morphology and hydraulics, they create a longitudinal sequence of aquatic habitat types moving from steep, fast flowing and turbulent boulder bed channels at the head of links to meandering, slow-flowing, low-gradient sand channels at the downstream end. Over the next five years, I will investigate more closely the important role of sedimentary links in controlling the spatial and temporal distribution of juvenile Atlantic salmon winter habitat in gravel-bed rivers. The specific objectives of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that sedimentary links exerts a strong control on the spatial and temporal pattern of juvenile Atlantic salmon winter habitat, (2) To test the hypothesis that sedimentary links exerts a strong control on the large-scale distribution of river ice types, (3) To investigate the response of salmon parr to the changing habitat conditions created by the formation of river ice, and (4) To asses the effect of anchor ice on the interstitial flow velocities of salmonid spawning substrates.



The proposed research program will yield a unique combination of physical and biological data that will help understanding some significant and unresolved research questions while providing stream managers the information they need to make realistic estimates of recruitment based on predictions of the winter carrying capacity of Canadian rivers.

"White dwarf stars represent the endpoint of stellar evolution for more than 95% of the stars in our galaxy, including our Sun. Having exhausted their nuclear fuel at their center, white dwarf stars simply cool off quietly over periods of billions of years. While their mass is comparable to that of the Sun, their volume is closer to that of Earth, which makes them extremely compact objects (about a million times the density of the Sun). The study of these dying stars and the determination of their fundamental parameters such as temperature, mass, and chemical composition, provide us with crucial information not only about the nature of these stars, but also on the evolutionary link with their immediate progenitors. The most accurate method used for measuring the fundamental parameters of white dwarf stars is the so-called spectroscopic technique where spectroscopic observations, i.e. the distribution of the stellar flux with wavelength, are compared with the predictions of detailed stellar atmospheres, a method originally developed and continuously being improved at the Universit� de Montr�al.  A stellar atmosphere corresponds to this thin superficial layer surrounding the star where all the radiation comes from. The goal of our project is to improve our understanding of white dwarf stars by measuring the fundamental parameters of a large sample of objects with the help of improved calculations of synthetic spectra appropriate for these stars. From an observational point of view, we will secure spectroscopic observations of white dwarf stars with surface abundances composed of hydrogen (DA type) and helium (DB type) using spectrographs located at Steward Observatory in Arizona as well as at Mont M�gantic Observatory in Qu�bec. From a theoretical point of view, we will calculate a new generation of model atmospheres and synthetic spectra, including several improvements in the constitutive physics such as line broadening, opacities, and convective energy transport. The comparison between observed and theoretical spectra will provide us with improved parameters for a large sample of white dwarf stars, which in turn will shed some light on their global properties as well as on their evolution.

"In the analysis of time-to-event data, when interest lies in measuring the distribution of the time from an initiating event, such as the onset of a disease, until an event of interest, e.g. death, it is often impractical or impossible to sample individuals from the time of the initiation of the condition of interest. Thus researchers may recruit subjects through cross-sectional sampling, which is a data collection scheme where the subjects have already experienced onset of the condition of interest prior to recruitment. The time-to-event of these individuals, known as prevalent cases in epidemiology, tends to be longer than that in the general population of individuals with the condition of interest (the incident cases), thus the data on durations obtained through cross-sectional sampling are biased compared to the population of interest, as individuals with longer event-times are more likely to be recruited into the sample.

  Data from prevalent cases have particular features that prevent direct extension of the standard methodologies in survival analysis which rely on incident cases. One such feature is informative censoring, as independence of censoring and failure times is one of the necessary assumptions for the martingale theory behind the tools used for incident cases. Another feature is covariate bias. In standard regression settings, the marginal distribution of the covariates holds no information on the parameters of interest, thus analyses are carried out by conditioning on the observed covariate values. When event-times are sampled with a bias, the marginal distribution of the associated covariates also differ from that of the incident population and depends on the regression parameters, and methodologies that take a joint approach offer more efficient estimators for these parameters.

 The main theme of this project is to train graduate students to study time-to-event data arising from cross-sectional sampling and propose appropriate methodologies for the analysis of such data. Each of these methodologies will be tested using simulation studies and applied to real data, such as data on survival with dementia collected as a part of a nation-wide study called Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA).

"Exercise/muscle contraction has an important role in skeletal muscle glucose disposal resulting from two processes. First, insulin-resistant skeletal muscles respond normally to contraction-stimulated glucose transport. Indeed, acute muscle contractions can stimulate glucose transport in absence of insulin. Second, following a single bout of exercise, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal is improved up to 24 hours post-exercise. Despite considerable amount of research, the basic mechanisms underlying these phenomenons remain unclear. An important observation came with the findings that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a modulator of both acute contraction-stimulated glucose transport and chronic exercise-mediated metabolic muscle adaptation. The extent of AMPK's role on these physiological processes is currently under extensive study. Although other signalling pathways (Ca2+ metabolism, nitric oxide, protein kinase C, AS160) may participate in contraction-induced metabolic responses in muscles, it is likely that repetitive AMPK activation, such as achieved by regular exercise, would benefit skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. An important research goal in this area is to better define the ""AMPK pathway"". Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may ""partner"" with AMPK in modulating contraction-stimulated acute and chronic muscle metabolic responses. Although chronic elevations of ROS have been associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease as well as diabetes, acute and localized endogenous production of ROS may be necessary for certain muscle responses such as increased glucose transport and initiation of genetic transcriptional activity resulting from contractions/exercise. The ""re-emerging"" concept, first proposed ~30 years ago, that is underlined by those findings hypothesizes that endogenous ROS act as an intracellular second messenger. However, more investigation is clearly warranted to better define this concept. Accordingly, the present research program aims at defining the effects of acute versus chronic elevations of intramuscular ROS and their relationship with AMPK activity in the regulation of the metabolic profile of the skeletal muscle.

"The work proposed here for the next few years builds on all of my previous research in spirit, and in particular sentiment analysis, causality, hedging, and (dream) emotion analysis. The unifying feature of all these topics is that they are concerned with (a) differentiating factual information from embedding meta-information in different text genres and (b) decoding this meta-information and making it accessible for automatic text analysis as an equal component in text meaning. That the factual content of a text contributes only one part of its meaning has been largely ignored in Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems to date. But recently, the possibility of commercial exploitation of sentiment and opinion-laden texts from abundant on-line sources such as blogs for product improvement has shifted attention to consider sentiment and even emotional content using shallow means. Now, valence shifters (language constructs that can invert the meaning of a clause, such as negation) are considered more widely. But still, the predominant technique for, for instance, sentiment analysis, is to simply count the number of positive vs. negative sentiment words in a sentence with a winner take all overall sentiment score. The limitations of the simplistic approach are obvious: a long string of positive statements about acting and directing in a movie review can be undone with the simple concluding statement: ""And yet the film bombs."". Stochastic techniques fall short, because (a) the linguistically relevant features have not been identified and thus there are no common annotation schemes nor training corpora yet (b) their compositional behavior is too complex for simple annotation schemes. With better understanding of the nature and behavior of all of the different meta-propositional devices will come better annotation schemas that will lead to more refined stochastic systems. In considering the linguistics of non-factual aspects of sentence meaning and how they contribute to the meaning of the text, I propose to develop an annotation scheme and a compositional semantics for texts that treats different meaning components coherently.","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computing and Information Sciences - B",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The primary aim of my research program is to increase our understanding of the biogeochemical cycles that are important for life on Earth through the use of trace metal and stable isotope geochemistry.  Besides the inherent importance of metals in the environment (i.e., in their roles as nutrients or toxins), the chemistry of metals is often linked to, or plays a controlling role in, important environmental processes.  Understanding metals in the environment is especially important in a changing world where human activities are perturbing many natural cycles and will have impacts on our food sources, health, and climate.  New analytical advancements have opened the door for investigation of stable isotope fractionation of many metals.  Isotopic signatures are powerful tools for identifying sources and sinks and for understanding biogeochemical cycling.  My research program combines research on metal biogeochemistry with innovative studies of natural metal isotopic variations.  The two primary objectives of my research program are (1) Metal Contaminants in the Environment and (2) The Marine Biogeochemistry of Trace Metals.  The main focus of (1) will be the study of mercury.  Mercury is a globally distributed and highly toxic pollutant.  Much of the natural cycle of Hg is not well understood and new approaches are necessary to better track Hg sources and transformations in the environment.  Dr. B.A. Bergquist recently demonstrated that Hg isotopes undergo unique isotopic fractionation that provides an indelible fingerprint for directly tracking and understanding Hg cycling in the environment.   These findings pave the way for tracing the mobility and bioccumulation of the Hg in the environment.  One of the goals of (2) will be to improve our understanding of the sources and biogeochemical cycling of iron in ocean.  Iron is a vital micronutrient in the ocean and plays a fundamental role in climate change by influencing the carbon cycle of the ocean.  Dr. Bergquist's research program combines both concentration and speciation studies of Fe with Fe isotopic signatures to gain insight into the sources and cycling of Fe in the ocean.

"Most flows encountered in industrial or environmental applications are turbulent, which is to say that they are characterised by enhanced levels of mixing associated with apparently random small-scale fluctuations of the velocity field.  This is one example of so-called chaotic behaviour of a physical system.  Although inherently difficult to understand, turbulence has many important practical applications including increasd skin friction drag (e.g. for aircraft) and increased wall heat transfer rates (e.g. for heat exhcangers.)  In the atmosphere and hydrosphere, turbulence is responsible for the rapid dilution of contaminants.  In order to improve the design of flow systems or mitigate adverse environmental impacts, engineers need to better understand turbulence and the associated transport.



Experimental studies are used to improve our understanding of turbulent flows, often with the long term goal of being able to predict the flow behaviour using numerical models.  For near-wall turbulence, an important and canonical test flow is the plane wall jet.  A plane wall jet is created by discharging fluid from a narrow slot parallel to a wall.  Wall jets have many important practical applications including: separation control on aircraft wings; film cooling in gas turbines; and controlling the discharge of effluent into lakes and rivers.  Measurement of the velocity field in turbulent flow creates a special challenge.  In order to capture the instantaneous velocity field, one requires special instruments.  One such tool is a laser doppler anemometer (LDA) which uses multiple intersecting laser beams to measure the instantaneous velocity at a specific location in a flow.



The research grant being applied for is to upgrade an LDA system and experimental wall jet facility at the University of Saskatchewan.","A�rospatial","Services et syst�mes de transport","Mechanical Engineering",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan

"The development of energy production, distribution, and storage systems that do not rely on the use of fossil fuels is one of the most important challenges facing our society today.  Moving to renewable fuels for ground and air transportation promises both environmental and economic benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enabling Canada to achieve sustainable energy independence.  

   The proposed research program is focused on developing improved models for the combustion of alternative fuels and their blends with petroleum jet fuels through a combination of detailed experiments using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques, numerical simulations, and combustion chemical-kinetic modeling. This research is critically important to enabling the use of biofuels in aviation gas-turbine engines and is supported by a collaborative research grant with Pratt & Whitney Canada. Another CRD proposal in this area has been submitted in collaboration with Rolls Royce Canada. This equipment will directly support research on the combustion of butanol as a potential bio-derived replacement for gasoline as part of an AUTO21 NCE team grant.  The proposed laser is critically needed for a proposed CRD grant with Martec LTD studying the combustion of hybrid flames of both gaseous and solid fuels for explosion hazard prediction.  

   The proposed high-repetition-rate laser for particle-tracking velocimetry (PTV) will support all of these research projects. Particles suspended in the flow within each experiment will be illuminated by this laser and imaged as a sequence of dots on a high-resolution CCD. The particle displacement multiplied by laser pulse frequency allows the velocity to be measured with the high accuracy needed for model validation.  The research into the fundamental combustion properties and emissions for blends of biofuels with petroleum fuels will permit the fuel blend to be chosen to optimize performance with minimal emissions in a specific engine application and pave the way for biofuels to be used in aircraft engines.  The requested equipment is a critically needed component of the experimental apparatus required to enable these collaborative research grants.

"The development of energy production, distribution, and storage systems that do not rely on the use of fossil fuels is a major challenge facing our society today.  Moving to renewable fuels for transportation applications would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable Canada to achieve sustainable energy independence.  The central aim of this research program is to develop accurate combustion and chemical-kinetic models for alternative fuels through coupled experimental, analytical, and computational investigations.  This program will utilize complementary experiments in multiple geometries to develop alternative-fuel chemical-kinetic models over a wide range of combustion regimes.  Initially, fuel reformation to hydrogen is targeted as the primary area of research within this program.  Due to the lack of hydrogen-distribution systems, the reformation of hydrocarbon and alternative fuels to a hydrogen-rich gas is a technology that may enable widespread fuel-cell application.  High catalyst costs and catalyst poisoning from pollutants are the main economic and technological limitations to current methods of fuel reformation.  In order to circumvent catalyst problems, cool-flame combustion has the potential to reform various fuels to hydrogen in compact devices at low temperatures.  This poorly-understood combustion regime occurs at moderate temperatures and elevated pressures.  The usefulness of cool flames for hydrogen production cannot currently be assessed due to a lack of experimental data or validated combustion models.  This program is aimed at developing predictive combustion models that describe cool-flame reformation.  These models must be rigorously validated against experiments to ensure that they accurately predict the phenomena of interest.  Towards this end, complementary experiments and computations will be performed that address fundamental modeling issues.  A long-term goal of this program is to develop novel commercial fuel reformers in collaboration with industry.  In summary, this research program targets the development of predictive models for alternative-fuel combustion and reformation through a coupled experimental, computational and analytical approach.

"This research program is devoted to the study of active optical devices based on metal stripe waveguides. Such waveguides were recently discovered to support a low-loss optical wave, termed a long-range surface plasmon-polariton wave. The main objective of this proposal is to research amplifiers, lasers and photodetectors, operating in this wave and implemented in metal stripe waveguides. Specific objectives, attainable within the 2-year time frame of this Steacie supplement, are to: (a) demonstrate net amplification and lasing using a dye solution as the gain medium; (b) design, fabricate and demonstrate tunable 1st order Bragg gratings; (c) design, fabricate and demonstrate a tunable surface plasmon dye laser using the gratings; and (d) design, fabricate and demonstrate Schottky contact detectors on silicon. Theoretical models will be developed for all of the devices, based on first principles, resting on electromagnetics and quantum optics. Experiments will be defined and conducted to verify and validate all models. Custom devices will be fabricated for this purpose, and to demonstrate the proposed structures and underlying phenomena. The scientific approach thus comprises a mix of theory and experiment appropriate to meeting the objectives. Achieving the main goal of this proposal establishes active functionality in an important new integrated optics technology. This technology will then lead to new applications in the fields of telecommunications and sensing, exploiting to advantage the presence of a metal in the optical path, and the peculiarities of the propagating surface plasmon wave. The results will be of interest to the plasmonics, optics, optical communications and sensor communities. It is expected that the results of this work will eventually lead to greater industrial competitiveness for Canadian companies working in these areas.","Technologie de l'instrumentation","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Steacie Fellowship Sel Cttee",2,"SMFSU ","EWR Steacie Fellowships - Supplement",Ontario,Ontario

"Proper plant patterning is important for optimized growth performance, plant architecture and biomass, plant  regeneration properties and stem cell allocation. An amazing suite of recent results has linked seemingly separate patterning processes, including embryo axis formation, meristem organization, lateral organ positioning and vascular patterning to the polar transport of the phyotohormone auxin. Based on previous work on Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) we have set up optimized genetic backgrounds for investigating the systems properties of auxin mediated patterning processes: (1) After discovering the equivalence of auxin foucssing mechanisms in the shoot meristem and in leaves, we are taking advantage of the better experimental and mathematical accessibility of the leaf system. Here we will explore the systems properties of self-regulatory auxin patterning, using novel visualization and unique local interference tools. Specifically, spatially and temporally highly controlled activity of MP/ARF5 in multiple mutant background can serve as an ideal switch to turn on/off auxin mediated patterning in numerous locations. Because equivalent mechanisms in the shoot meristem, the findings will have implications for the entire shoot architecture.  (2) In a complementing line of research, we have identified the relative contributions of five ARFs with activating (Q-rich) middle domains in patterning processes, including immediate target genes and nodes of interaction with co-regulators of the Aux/IAA family. (3) Along a third line, we have identified and molecularly characterized a first suppressor of ARF function, which defines a largely unexplored antagonistic pathway. We will explore this and other ARF antagonizing pathways using genetic and molecular approaches. Finally, (4) our genomic work on genes in early vascular development downstream of ARF regulation leads us into the exploration of the transcription factor hierarchy in vascular tissue specification.

My main objective is to model the insurance market equilibrium with its different participants: insurers, reinsurers, policyholders, financial intermediaries and regulators. More precisely, I would like to investigate the impact of changes in the regulatory requirements on the overall insurance market, that is, for instance how companies and reinsurance companies share risks optimally in the presence of regulators and costs. With the implementation of new solvency regulations (Solvency II) and new accounting standards in Europe and soon in North America, this matter is a current issue. The output of this research will contribute to our knowledge of insurance markets and insurance contracts. The theoretical approaches developed herein will help to provide policymakers, regulators, insurers and consumers with insights on how to improve the efficient functioning of the insurance market and how to anticipate and understand the effects of regulation on the insurance market equilibrium.



My second objective is to analyze the financial market and to provide new designs of index-linked products, optimal for investors or/and issuers with different types of constraints and objectives. The first constraint I would like to consider is capital protection (either a minimum guarantee at the maturity of the product or an American guarantee at any time prior to the contract maturity). I want also to incorporate the fact that investors seek opportunities to outperform the market with a high confidence level.  The ultimate goal is to better understand the diversity of the structured products that are currently exchange-traded, the rationale to buy or sell specific designs of structured products, and the impact on the overall financial market equilibrium of the introduction of new products.

"There are approximately 20,000-25,000 genes in the genome; however, this number dramatically underestimates the complexity and diversity of proteins that can be synthesized in humans. It is now well-established that individual genes can give rise to multiple protein products through a variety of mechanisms, including generation of alternative protein-encoding messenger RNA molecules and modification of proteins following their synthesis (so-called post-translational processing).  In our analysis of putative receptors for inhibins, gonadal proteins that control pituitary hormone synthesis, we uncovered immunoglobulin superfamily, member 1 (IGSF1).  This gene is particularly active in the central nervous system (CNS) and anterior pituitary gland.  Intriguingly, the IGSF1 gene generates at least four different protein forms in a variety of ways. We cloned, characterized and knocked out the Igsf1 gene in mice in an effort to determine its roles in pituitary and CNS function. Surprisingly, mice lacking the gene appeared normal. Our subsequent analyses shed light on this finding. Three of the four IGSF1 forms were successfully deleted in the mutant mice, but the fourth remained at levels observed in normal mice. This is critical because form 4 is particularly abundant in the CNS.  In addition, we have now observed that the form 1 protein, which is the most abundant type in the pituitary, is processed in a manner that renders it indistinguishable from form 4. Therefore, we predict that retention of form 4 in mutant mice can compensate for the loss of the other three protein forms. In this application, we propose two sets of experimental approaches to learn more about the biology of IGSF1 with the long-term objective of determining the function of this gene and its various protein products. Ultimately, these studies will give us a more thorough appreciation of the diversity of mechanisms cells can use to generate multiple proteins from the same underlying genetic sequence.

"We are seeking funds for the acquisition of a Beckman Optima(TM) MAX-XP bench top ultracentrifuge with two fixed angle rotors (MLA-130, TLA-100.3) one swinging bucket rotor (MS-50) and one near vertical rotor (TLN-120), providing a full range of capacity and centrifugal forces. With appropriate adapters, these rotors can be used for a variety of tube sizes, allowing ultracentrifugation of volumes from 0.8 mL up to 5 mL, per tube. Each rotor holds up to four tubes, allowing work up of from 0.8 to 20 mL of sample. The Optima(TM) MAX-XP has very rapid acceleration (< 1 min), achieving centrifugal forces up to 10e6 x g (depending on the rotor). Spins are therefore more rapid than a standard floor model, which is ideal for working with small volumes of recombinant protein or cell extracts. The versatility of the Optima(TM) MAX-XP is evident in the variety of research conducted by the six applicants interested in using it routinely. For example, the Optima(TM) MAX-XP ultracentrifuge will be used to isolate mitochondria, microsomes, sperm nuclei and low abundance proteins from a variety of biological sources. The unifying aspect is the need to routinely generate highly purified subcellular components on a relatively small scale. 



Acquisition of the Optima(TM) MAX-XP ultracentrifuge will allow the applicants to explore aspects of their respective research programs that are currently not accessible, largely due to scale. Ultracentrifugation of microvolumes (less than 1 mL in some cases) will permit work with low abundance proteins, allow scale-up in replication, minimize tissue sample size and facilitate procedures that are hampered by the availability of suitable equipment.

"Plant secondary metabolites are compounds that mediate interactions between plants and their environment. My research program explores (1) pathways involved in secondary metabolism and (2) the ecological roles of secondary metabolites. For example the study of suberin formation allows exploration of the regulation of metabolic pathways and the partitioning of carbon between different potential metabolic endpoints - critical knowledge required to make informed decisions about modifying plant metabolism for improved nutrition or enhanced disease resistance. Suberin is a tissue-specific cell wall modification deposited in a developmental manner as well as in response to wounding and plays a critical role in water retention and protection against pathogens. Using chemical, biochemical and metabolomic approaches my research group has identified key enzymatic steps unique to the biosynthesis of suberin. This proposal describes my intent to isolate and characterize the genes encoding these steps. While molecular biology tools are new to my research program, their use represents a logical progression in our approach to study suberin biosynthesis. 

     From an ecological point of view, plants use secondary metabolites to prevent pathogens from causing disease. Plant pathogens, however, can use plant-derived secondary metabolites as cues to locate potential hosts. Ginsenosides are triterpenoid saponins with mild fungitoxic properties that leach into the soil surrounding ginseng roots. We have shown that Pythium irregulare secretes an enzyme (glycosidase) that selectively degrades specific ginsenosides to a common intermediate (ginsenoside F2), which is then taken up by the organism, making ginsenosides host recognition factors for this organism. We will characterize the enzymes involved and mechanism by which P. irregulare utilizes ginsenosides to find host roots. 

      My research objectives provide tools to study the regulation of secondary metabolism and the functional roles of secondary metabolites. The results will contribute to our fundamental understanding of plant metabolism: essential knowledge upon which more practical applications can be built.

Over the last ten years, the Institute of Agro-Food Technology has been involved in supporting innovation and

technology transfer among small businesses located in Eastern Quebec. The Institute allocates on a yearly basis

$100,000 from its budget to support R&D activities. Recently, the Quebec Government acknowledges the

contribution of the institution and gave a yearly grant of $250,000 to operate a College Center for Technology

Transfer in bio-products. The fact that the Institute won various grants and national recognitions shows the

value of the works done by the staff. The Institute wants to improve its applied research capability by getting

more teachers involved, while reducing their teaching loads, by recruiting graduate students through an alliance

with a university and by putting in place various measures that will promote R&D activities. The applied

research activities will focus on bio-products, which are at the center of various strategic plans both local and

regional, such as the ACCORD Program on Peat Moss Products and Agro-environmental Technologies, and

development plans from neighboring communities aiming at specialty products and agro-forestry products. To

improve its research capability, the Institute will have to recruit scientific and technical personnel, both from

within the teaching staff and outside, in order to strengthen its applied research and technology transfer teams.

Part of the grant given by NSERC will be used to lessen the teaching loads of staff members, to hire new

personnel and students and support extension and promotional activities aimed at small businesses spread

across a large area.","Non disponible","Non disponible","Private Sector Advisory Board",2,"CCIP  ","College and Community Innovation Program","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Dutch elm disease (DED) is the most destructive disease of elms. It has been estimated that, during the last 100 years, over one billion mature elms were killed by two successive pandemics of DED caused by two microscopic fungi called Ophiostoma ulmi and O. novo-ulmi. Our ongoing research suggests that an Ophiostoma gene (called Omp2) coding for a high affinity ammonium transporter is important for the virulence of the DED pathogens towards elms. We intend to clarify the role of Omp2 in pathogenesis. In particular, we will verify the hypothesis that the action of Omp2 stems from its effect on the regulation of yeast and mycelium forms of the DED fungi in the presence of low concentrations of ammonium. We further propose to analyse two additional genes which may be involved in other regulatory pathways for fungal growth, as suggested by the recovery of O. novo-ulmi mutants with impaired yeast or mycelial development. The short-term benefit of this project is a better understanding of how the DED fungi develop in elms and eventually kill them. Anticipated long-term benefits are the identification of fungal targets for the development of efficient and environmentally acceptable control methods to save the elms.","Gestion des cultures (lutte contre les organismes nuisibles et reproduction)","Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","DAS - Life Sciences Selection Committee",2,"RGPAS ","Discovery Grants Program - Accelerator Supplements","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

L'�change dans le sol est typiquement r�alis� au moyen de puits g�othermiques verticaux dont la longueur est de l'ordre de 100 m.  Les pompes � chaleur sont des appareils de r�frig�ration qui permettent de hausser le niveau de temp�rature d'une source � basse temp�rature vers un puits � haute temp�rature. La pr�sente demande porte sur quatre projets qui seront r�alis�s par autant d'�tudiants.   



       Le premier projet a pour objectif de mod�liser les diff�rents composants d'une pompe � chaleur g�othermique � haute temp�rature (60C) en vue d'en optimiser le choix et assurer le maximum de rendement. Suite � ce projet, il est pr�vu de r�aliser un prototype de pompe � chaleur g�othermique � haute temp�rature dont les performances seront �valu�es exp�rimentalement. En plus de permettre de chauffer les espaces, cette pompe � chaleur permettra le chauffage de l'eau chaude sanitaire. Le troisi�me projet analysera le gel dans les puits g�othermiques lorsque la pompe � chaleur puise beaucoup d'�nergie en hiver. Le quatri�me projet traitera du geocooling. Ce proc�d� utilise les puits g�othermiques pour refroidir un fluide qui est ensuite utilis� pour refroidir � gratuitement � un b�timent.



        Ces projets contribueront � r�duire la consommation �nerg�tique des b�timents et � former du personnel hautement qualifi� en r�frig�ration et en conception de puits g�othermiques, deux domaines dans lesquels le Canada a besoin d'experts.

"Depuis la mise en op�ration du premier satellite radar commercial, le satellite canadien RADARSAT-1 en 1996, la t�l�d�tection radar s'est montr�e un outil bien adapt� � l'observation, l'analyse et la compr�hension de notre environnement en pleine mutation sous l'effet de la pression des activit�s anthropiques et des changements climatiques. En comparaison aux images optiques ou micro-ondes passives, les images radar offrent une faible sensibilit� aux perturbations atmosph�riques et aux conditions d'ensoleillement tout en offrant une r�solution spatiale �lev�e (3m-50m) permettant des �tudes tant � l'�chelle r�gionale que locale. Les images RADARSAT-1 (polarisation HH) sont utilis�es pour de multiples applications au Canada tant pour la cartographie des glaces marines, que pour le suivi des icebergs, la cartographie des terres inond�es et des milieux humides, le d�versement des nappes de p�trole ou l'estimation du vent en mer.

"Pyrolytic conversion of a large variety of agricultural and forestry residues into liquid bio-oils and solid biochar is a very attractive technology that has been perfected and scaled up in our laboratories of the Institute for Chemicals and Fuels from Alternative Resources (ICFAR).  Bio-oils offer a large variety of alternative applications, including their use as fuels, pesticides, insecticides, flavors, and pharmaceuticals.  However, their characteristics vary greatly as a function of the original feedstock and of the operating conditions and, typically, they cannot be immediately utilized without further processing and upgrading.  Similarly, the pyrolytic bio-char needs to be upgraded to take full advantage of its characteristics and maximize its value. Therefore, building on previous experience and track record, the main objectives of the proposed research program include (a) continuous improvements of the fluid bed technology to allow the efficient processing of an ever expanding array of materials that are carefully selected to avoid competition with food or other more efficient biological conversion processes (agricultural and forestry residues, co-products of the food processing industry, and byproducts generated in biological conversion processes), and (b) the development of upgrading technologies for bio-oils and bio-chars produced from different residues to make them suitable for integration into the existing markets for conventional fossil fuels and chemicals as individual products or as blends.  These objectives will be achieved by undertaking new projects, all involving graduate students, on (1) the improvement of the solid feeders for fluid bed pyrolyzers to handle cohesive and fibrous biomass materials; (2) investigating fractional condensation to achieve a primary separation of fractions of bio-oil that could then separately utilized or upgraded using appropriate reaction pathways; (3) studying physical and chemical upgrading of bio-chars; and (4) conducting a comprehensive research program on bio-oil catalytic and thermal upgrading, including the potential and synergies derived from the co-processing (co-pyrolysis) of biomass/bio-oils and of Canadian heavy hydrocarbons (refinery heavy bottoms, heavy oils and bitumens).

"When it comes to acoustic comfort of an aircraft, usual engineering metrics (based upon A-weighted Sound Pressure Levels or Speech Interference Levels) do not ""tell the whole story"". In this respect, it would be very useful to be able to ""hear"" the ambiance of an aircraft cabin before it flies, and ""hear"" the impact of planned modification or acoustic treatment before it is actually implemented. Similarly, sound reproduction in cockpit simulators is considered an essential component to a virtual environment that adds ambience, emotion, and a sense of presence to the simulation for pilot training.

The objective of this project is to develop general methods and implement these methods to build an ""acoustic simulator"" that should emulate the acoustic environment of aircraft cabins and cockpits. Such a simulator would be based on arrays of reproduction loudspeakers and would provide a convincing virtual immersion experience (similar acoustic design philosophies are of growing importance in architecture and in the automotive sector). This platform will enable a program of systematic evaluation of human responses within the virtual environment. The outcome of the project is methodology, software and hardware for experimental sound field rendering of aircraft cabins and cockpits. The systems developed will provide both marketing and engineering design tools to help Bombardier advertise and improve the acoustic comfort of their business jet aircraft. On the other hand, it will help CAE improve their sound field rendering capability in cockpit simulators.

"Requirements engineering (RE) is gathering information from stakeholders of a client organization to

produce a coherent requirements specification (RS) for the system the client desires. This work's goal is to

develop methods that help producing this RS.  Requirements elicitation is gathering information about the

system to be built from any source, the client, users, organization at work, interviews, video recordings,

organization policy documents, vision documents, RFPs, etc.  Requirements analysis is refining this

information into a RS by deriving what is possible from the information and validating it with the client and

users.



  My focus is on understanding the RE process to know what works and what does not, and armed with this

understanding, to propose and validate methods and tools that improve RE's effectiveness:

  1. understanding the various roles in the RE process: The participants in RE are at least the customer,

     users, requirements engineers, and system developers. Unless each performs her role properly, the RE

     process can lead to a system that meets no stakeholder's real requirements even if it meets all

     specified requirements.

  2. dealing with requirements that are expressed in natural language (NL): Even if there is a formal

     mathematical specification, an overwhelming majority of all documents involved in RE are in NL, which is

     inherently ambiguous.  An ambiguous NL requirements specification can lead to incorrect implementations.

     Moreover, each ambiguity requires asking stakeholders to resolve the ambiguity.



  Another area of research for me is electronic publishing. Development will be done

in Multi-Lingual Formatting and Dynamic PostScript Fonts as case studies in RE.

"This proposal will determine the normal function of trace amines in the mammalian brain. Trace amines are a group of chemicals found in all species. Although their role in insects has been well established, their role in mammals is not known. Nerve cells in the brain communicate with each other through the release of chemicals known as neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters are released from nerve cells in response to electrical activity, and bind to proteins known as receptors on a second cell. For each neurotransmitter there are multiple types of receptors that it can interact with. This binding of neurotransmitter to receptor results in the transmittance of information from one cell to another. The trace amines are a group of chemicals which, like neurotransmitters, are synthesized in nerve cells. However, the trace amines are present in much lower concentrations than neurotransmitters, and available evidence suggests that at the concentrations normally found, trace amines do not function directly in the transmission of information from one cell to the other. Rather, our previous data suggests that trace amines may regulate the efficiency by which neurotransmitters can convey information from one cell to another. The current work will systematically examine which trace amines regulate the efficiency of signaling by which neurotransmitters, by measuring the electrical activity of nerve cells in the presence of various combinations of neurotransmitters and trace amines. Once these interactions have been determined, we will begin to examine the mechanisms by which such effects occur. This will be done by examining whether the same interactions are possible in systems where individual trace amine receptors have been eliminated. By using synthetic chemicals that only interact with individual receptors for a particular neurotransmitter we will also determine which sub-types of neurotransmitter receptor are involved in the observed interactions.

"For many issues that greatly concern Canadians, action requires locational decisions: detection and monitoring of environmental hazards, and efficient response to epidemic outbreaks, are but a few examples where most key factors are located in geographical space. Presently, management decisions are supported by quantitative models; these models are potentially desirable tools, which can link, for example, disease incidence to health hazards, thus providing a realistic picture of where health care services will be most needed in the near future. Unfortunately, current models are often uncertain, therefore unreliable. In the best cases, unreliable models provide decision makers with a realistic, but blurry picture of the factors they need to manage, leading to ineffective decisions; in the worst cases the picture is so blurry that it is confusing, and may lead to management decisions that are not just ineffective, but harmful. The uncertainty stems from two properties of geographical factors: things vary unevenly in space, and near things are more similar than distant things. These two properties often occur simultaneously, whereas each existing modeling method can only address one of them; therefore, each method only partially clears the blurriness of a picture. Worse: each method, in trying to address one source of uncertainty, can aggravate the other, increasing the overall uncertainty.

In response to these limitations, I propose an application-oriented procedure that increases the reliability of quantitative models and provides an effective support system for locational planning and management decisions. The proposed research will identify trends and accurately estimate their spatial dimension; it will analyze where and why things appear similar; it will merge the knowledge obtained in these steps and integrate existing methods to model geographical factors at an appropriate spatial scale. This procedure will provide truly reliable quantitative models, capable of describing geographical factors through a picture that is not only realistic, but also sharp. This sharp and realistic picture will aid decision makers to clearly identify their management targets and to make the best decisions for the benefit of Canadians.

"The objective of this research is to predict potential effects of climate change on the distribution and abundance of a large range of plant and animal species from Quebec. The project will support regional strategies of adaptation to climate change in the field of biodiversity conservation. We will use the best available data and the most advanced statistical techniques to develop quantitative models representing the complex relationships between species distributions and environmental variables, including climate. We will work in three steps.

(1)    )	we will evaluate how phenology (the timing of biological events) and species distributions have been

affected by recent climate change.

(2)    )	we will construct ecological niche models for a wide array of plant and animal species including trees,

other vascular plants, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. These models will be based on the climate and land cover

that presently define the distribution of species, and will use high resolution scenarios of regional climate

change to project (2050 and 2100) future species-by-species distribution changes.

(3)    )	based on the output from the first and second steps, we will zoom in on the species and regions within

Quebec that are expected to be most heavily impacted by climate change, to develop regional strategies of

biodiversity conservation that incorporate potential climatic threats.

That is, there are roughly a 10-million-billion potentially mutagenic sites per day in each person. The body maintains a complex system of DNA repair enzymes to control this damage, keeping genetic information intact to be passed on to the next generation, and keeping cancer at bay.  MutY and AlkA are enzymes that recognize DNA damage caused by radiation, free radicals and environmental carcinogens.  They begin DNA repair by removing the damaged site.  We introduce isotopic labels (atoms that are heavier than normal) into damaged DNA, then measure how the reaction rates change.  This gives us the structure of the enzyme catalyzed transition state.  This information will give us a greater understanding of how DNA repair works.  



We are also developing new methods of measuring KIEs. KIE measurements are technically difficult and time-consuming. We are developing methods using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that will reduce the time required by years.  Using NMR, we can measure KIEs using naturally occurring heavy isotopes.  Synthesizing labelled compounds can take more than 2 years, so this will accelerate KIE measurement tremendously.  We will use this technique to study glycosidases, a class of enzymes that breaks down complex sugars.  Glycosidases are important in every area of biology, from infectious disease, and cancer, to recycling cellulose (paper) into chemical products and biofuels.  We will use KIEs to learn about glycosidase reactions.

"The gut is a large organ which is continuously remodelling itself in order to maintain its structure and function. One of the most important functions of the gut is to protect the body from ingested bacteria and dietary anti-nutritional factors (such as fiber) by secreting large amounts of mucus. Mucus is primarily composed of mucin proteins, which are continuously synthesized and secreted. In order to produce this mucus, the gut needs a large amount of specific nutrients such as the essential amino acid threonine. Because mucins are resistant to digestion, mucin proteins and the associated threonine are lost from the body. When the body is challenged by bacteria or dietary fiber, the gut reacts by increasing the production and release of mucus, which means even more threonine is needed to maintain an appropriate intestinal defense. Because the body cannot make threonine, more dietary threonine is required to meet the increased demands by the gut. Does this diversion of limited dietary threonine to the gut reduce the amount of threonine reaching the rest of the body for growth? This research proposal will show that a bacterial toxin and fiber challenge will increase mucus secretion in the gut which in turn will require more threonine. In order to develop dietary recommendations for this increased mucus secretion, we will develop a method to accurately determine the gut's actual requirement for threonine and how this changes with a gut challenge. And finally, this research will determine whether the whole body supply of threonine is diverted to the gut for mucus synthesis in the event of a gut challenge. Overall, this research proposal will describe how the gut responds to a challenge and how the body re-organizes its nutrient demands in order accommodate the gut's increased requirements. Not only is this information critical in the animal industries of Canada where low-grade gut diseases and high fiber diets are common, but such information is also essential to effectively design therapeutic diets for human patients with gut diseases or infections.","Gestion des animaux (maladies animales, reproduction)","Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","Integrative Animal Biology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Newfoundland and Labrador",Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador

"In general our research will focus on atmospheric chemistry with an overall goal of improving the understanding of important processes in the atmosphere.



The first part of our proposed research will explore the conditions at which atmospheric aerosol particles transform from liquid to solid and vice versa.  In other words, we will explore phase transitions of aerosol particles that are of atmospheric importance.  In these studies we will focus on mixed organic-inorganic particles at temperatures relevant for the free troposphere, which is the region of the atmosphere between approximately 1 km and 18 km in height. Knowledge of the particle phase (i.e. solid or liquid) is necessary to predict the reactivity of particles and also the impact of particles on climate. Our laboratory studies may also be important for predicting the formation of cirrus clouds in the atmosphere.  



The second part of our proposed research will explore reactions between gas-phase species and aerosol particles, termed heterogeneous chemistry.  Specific reactions to be studied include the reaction between N2O5 and aqueous aerosol particles coated with organic films and NO3 radicals with organic particles.  Information from these studies may lead to improved predictions of N2O5, NO3, and O3 concentrations in the atmosphere.   Our research may also be important for predicting the lifetime of organic particles in the atmosphere and for predicting the fate of toxic species such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are abundant in the atmosphere.

"How genetic variation is maintained in traits that enhance fitness remains a fundamental dilemma in evolutionary biology. Several major theories have been put forth to explain the persistence of genetic variance. These theories include genic capture, fluctuating selection, genotype-by-environment interactions, genotype-by-genotype interactions, heterosis, and antagonistic pleiotropy. My students and I are testing some of these theories using an animal behaviour approach that incorporates tools from statistical genetics and ecological physiology. Our laboratory and field based empirical research quantifies the phenotypic and genetically based variation in condition, life-history, and sexually selected traits and determines how this variation is influenced by diet and the social environment.  Specifically, our research examines (1) how dietary variation in essential and limited elements (nitrogen and phosphorus) influences the genetics of condition (including growth rate, development time, adult size, body fat content, and nutrient retention in the body), and (2) how diet and condition interact to influence sexually selected and life-history traits (attractiveness of male long-distance mate advertisement signals, female mating preferences, lifetime reproductive success, anti-predatory behaviours, and survival of both parents and their offspring). Our short-term research goals are to determine whether the interactions between these traits act to maintain high genetic variance. We will also conduct an artificial selection experiment with the short-term goal of ascertaining whether temporally fluctuating selection can maintained the genetic variance in sex-limited and sexually selected traits. Overall, our research will explicitly test two of the above theories for the maintenance of high genetic variance - genic capture and temporally fluctuating sex-limited selection. Long-term, the overarching goal of my research program is to contribute to a more complete understanding of how high genetic variance is maintained in traits that enhance fitness.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Evolution & Ecology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Particulate flows, which can be found in the chemical processes of many industries such as the pulp and paper, pharmaceutical, food and petroleum, are known to exhibit complex behavior that still remains poorly understood. In the pharmaceutical industry, for instance, the lack of knowledge concerning the mechanisms governing the mixing processes involved in the manufacturing of solid form drugs is such that the design and scale-up of these processes is generally achieved by empirical methods. The objective of this on-going research program is to gain insight into the behavior of particulate systems by developing efficient and accurate computer models that simulate the flow of particles in such systems. Of particular relevance to this work is the application of these models to dry granular and solid-liquid mixing processes found in many industries, and to coating operations for the manufacturing of value-added paper.



The benefits of this research program include a better understanding of the flow behavior of particulate systems and the development of more efficient and controllable mixing and coating processes, both of which are of significant importance for the Canadian industry. This work will also pave the way to the investigation of other processes involving colloidal, granular or multiphase flows. Finally, it enables the training of highly qualified chemical engineers for the design and operation of processes involving powders and particles of all kinds.","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"The mixing of powders and granular materials is a topic of great relevance to the Canadian pharmaceutical industry. It is known, for example, that the process operating conditions for the manufacturing of a drug may be highly sensitive to its ingredient properties. This fact and the importance of manufacturing high-efficiency and low-risk pharmaceutical products validates research initiatives that investigate the physical phenomena governing the flow and the mixing of the solid ingredients involved in the formulation and production of such drugs. The reality is that, despite a growing interest in the dynamics of powders, little is known in this field as compared to the state of the art in fluid mechanics. This work concerns the development and improvement of experimental and computational methods for the characterization of the flow behavior of powders in blending equipment. At the experimental level, an innovative radioactive particle tracking well-suited for low concentration of small particles will be devised. At the computational level, models that we have developed in recent years, which are based on the discrete element method, will be improved and extended so that they can deal with particulate systems closer to those found in the pharmaceutical industry. The benefits to the Canadian pharmaceutical industry will include a better understanding of powder technology and the development of more efficient and controllable blending processes for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. Finally, this project will enable the training of highly qualified chemical engineers for the design and operation of chemical processes involving powders of all kinds.","Produits pharmaceutiques administrables � l'homme","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","RPP Internal Decision Cttee","1 & 2","CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Pseudoautosomal region genes (PAR) are localized at the very tip of the X and Y chromosomes. The DNA sequence and structure that surrounds them is different and highly repetitive and allows these genes to escape the normal process of X inactivation in females.  In the mouse, these genes have moved to non-sex chromosomes and yet we have evidence that they are still regulated by one factor, called ATRX.   The ATRX protein tends to bind to repetitive DNA elements and to change the structure of DNA. In this proposal, we will investigate the mechanisms that control the expression of the ancestral PAR genes located on different chromosomes in the mouse.  In addition, we will examine the regulation of the PAR genes in the mammalian order artiodactyla (including sheep and cattle), the closest ancestor of mouse in which these genes still reside in the PAR region on the X chromosome. To achieve this we will investigate the ability of ATRX to bind to shared repetitive sequences among the various aPAR genes.  We also propose to examine the outcome of ATRX depletion on the expression of the PAR genes in murine, sheep and cow cell lines.   Very importantly, this proposal addresses how the PAR genes maintain co-regulation despite being physically separated in the rodent genome. These studies will therefore contribute greatly to our understanding of the evolution of gene regulatory mechanisms in general.

"Ultrafiltration membranes (i.e. membranes), are becoming the technology of choice for drinking water treatment applications.   This is largely due to the fact that membranes, when compared to conventional sand filtration systems, can more effectively and consistently remove particulate contaminants, such as microbial pathogens.  However, during filtration, material can accumulate and foul the membrane, increasing the resistance to the permeating flow.  The strategies currently used to overcome excessive fouling increase the capital and operating costs of membrane systems above those for conventional sand filtration systems; as a result, the ability of water providers to implement 'advanced' water treatment technologies is limited.  Also, membrane, like other filtration systems, cannot effectively remove soluble contaminants, such as some disinfection by-products and emerging contaminants (e.g. endocrine disrupting and pharmaceutically active compounds), without some form of pre-treatment.  

The overall objective of the proposed research is to optimize the performance of membrane systems to enable water providers to implement membrane treatment to consistently provide high quality drinking water to consumers.  Two intermediate objectives are proposed and focus on developing the fundamental knowledge needed to 1) minimize membrane fouling and 2) maximize the removal of all contaminants of concern.  The outcome of the proposed research will be engineering tools to optimize the performance of membrane systems (i.e. minimize fouling and maximize the removal of soluble contaminants); and as a result, reduce both the design (i.e. field-testing) and implementation (capital and operating) costs of membrane systems, enabling more water providers to adopt this advanced treatment technology.  The research outcome is of particular importance to small water providers/municipalities, many of which currently cannot afford to implement advanced drinking water treatment.  In British Columbia alone, at any one time, over 300 small water providers/municipalities fall into this category, and as a result are under constant boil-water advisories.

"We propose research in the area of in vivo molecular imaging, a recent paradigm to visualize and quantify

cellular and biomolecular processes in whole living and intact organisms. A first objective is to develop optical

imaging technology that will allow obtaining three-dimensional images of such processes in laboratory mice,

which play a fundamental role in the development of new therapies for diseases of human concern, but also in

our understanding of such diseases (e.g. cancer). To achieve this, we will upgrade a small animal imaging

system developed by our industrial partner (QUIDD) involved in the project by endowing it with tomographic

capabilities. Tomography is a technique that allows non-invasive imaging inside the body of a living organism,

i.e. without inducing damage. Particularly attractive is that this is achieved via measurements made outside the

organism without disturbing it. Here, we more specifically resort to fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT) and disease markers that fluoresce (i.e. that reemit light after being themselves exposed to light) to pinpoint specific biomolecular/cellular processes. To serve this purpose, the imaging technology we develop will become an important tool to the biologist and medical researcher. Even more powerful will be to combine FDOT with other biomedical imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Another objective of our research is to develop techniques enabling to merge FDOT with PET and MRI in a single imaging system, hence achieving multi-modal imaging. Finally, the research will also contribute to the development and validation of bimodal markers (fluorescent/radioactive for FDOT/PET imaging and fluorescent/magnetic for FDOT/MRI imaging). Our team has collectively a strong expertise in different areas of such transdisciplinary work, along with state-of-the-art infrastructures to carry this research. Important outcomes of our work will be to train highly qualified personnel in this promising and exciting field

of high relevance to the health of Canadians, and a priority for Canada's economic wealth.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Biomedical Technologies",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"This research is divided into two physically related areas (A) Air-to-air heat and moisture exchange and (B) Moisture deposition ,migration, caking and cake strength in potash.



    (A) Air-to-air heat and water vapor exchange between exhaust air and supply air to ventilate buildings can reduce the size of heating boilers and the size of chillers for air-conditioning by 10 to 30% as well as the annual energy costs for heating and cooling.  This research on air-to-air and water vapor exchange will lead to improved performance and reduce costs of these devices and reduce costs for heating and air conditioning buildings.



    (B) Water vapor adsorption, deposition, and migration in granular potash and other similar bulk fertilizers causes caking between particles and the formation of dust, especially in warm humid climates.  If these moisture interactions become excessive, the fertilizer must be recycled or discarded because it cannot be used in agricultural seed and fertilizer distribution machines.  This research on moisture deposition and migration in potash fertilizer will lead to better models of these processes, new data and models for recrystallization and caking and cake strength and better methods to reduce caking and dust formation in potash.



     Both of these research applications are interconnected by the common principles of heat and water transfer in semi-permeable porous media where microscopic and submicrosscopic length scales are important.

 ""Reading"" is a recent skill, acquired only about 10,000 years ago. Fluent reading requires, as a first step, that we be able to identify individual words, and this issue has been the topic of considerable research, particularly over the last 45 years. A wide spread assumption is that the system responsible for identifying words consists of a stable processing architecture. In my view a consideration of the current literature, along with work from my lab strongly suggests that this fundamental assumption is false. Instead, the system is dynamic, reconfiguring itself in response to the context. The first party of the grant suggests a number of lines of investigation to put this conclusion on as firmer empirical footing.

 The second part of the grant addresses the wide spread view that word identifcation is ""automatic"" in various ways (needing neither intention nor attention to identify a word). My hypothesis is that this view is too strong, and that both intention and attention can be shown to strongly influence visual word recognition in a variety of contexts. Several different lines of investigation are proposed to investigate this claim.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Skeletal carbonate is our primary source of paleo-biological information, and the primary means by which carbon is transferred from the atmosphere-ocean to the lithosphere. As such, processes which control its preservation and fidelity (i.e. taphonomy) are of primary importance to interpreting the fossil record and the carbon cycle. My research quantifies taphonomic processes and potential preservation biases at scales ranging from within individual environments to across latitudes, with a focus on coastal settings as the main locus of global elemental exchange and anthropogenic impact. Over the past 15 years samples and data from tropical, temperate, and now polar locations have been collected to form the foundation for these latitudinal comparisons. As part of the proposed research, preliminary death assemblages from the key Arctic setting (site of rapid environmental change and ice-scouring) will be expanded and complimented with experiments.  Also, time-series experimental data will be obtained through the VENUS sub-sea observatory system in order to more closely track the nature and episodicity of taphonomic processes.  

Megabias along latitudes or other environmental gradients, has significant implications for how we interpret changes in biodiversity, for example during past climate changes, with a view of forecasting biotic response to future changes.  It also is key to assembling a global model of carbonate burial in shelf environments, currently poorly constrained but estimated to control half of the total carbonate burial, the main carbon sink of the carbon cycle.

"Our research aims at understanding the interactions of the very young equine embryo with its environment in the uterus of the mare during the first month of pregnancy, a time when 10-20% of pregnancies are lost for reasons that we don't understand. The success and failure of early pregnancy is of fundamental and economic importance in all the domestic animals but the horse is an especially good species in which to study its underlying physiology; the equine embryo can be flushed from the uterus throughout the second to fourth weeks without harming the mare and, also, has structural and functional features that are not found in the embryos of other species. One such feature is the embryo's production and use of steroid hormones that we believe to be very important in influencing its local environment. This 'steroidogenesis' and steroid metabolism is being studied in detail. Another unusual feature is a thin, tough, transparent capsule that envelops the hollow ball of cells (the conceptus) as it expands rapidly from a diameter of less that 0.2 mm to one of more than 20 mm during its first two weeks in the uterus. Having described the biochemical makeup of the capsule, we now want to test our idea that it is vital for attaching the conceptus to the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) where the placenta will later develop. We think that this adhesion involves particular sugar molecules in the capsule and protein molecules on the endometrium and will test this notion using the very latest biochemical and molecular techniques on tissues collected from pregnant mares.  In order to discover what goes wrong when pregnancy fails, we use a model system of 'compromised' pregnancy; at the end of the second week of pregnancy we treat some mares with a prostaglandin that reduces progesterone production by the ovary.  Despite the treatment, the conceptus can survive in the uterus for another 3-4 days after which it is recovered and compared with conceptuses from 'control' mares not treated with prostaglandin.  The comparisons of conceptuses and uterine materials from normal and compromised pregnancies are gradually enabling us to pinpoint the differences in proteins and steroid hormone activities that are associated with pregnancy failure.

"The production of viable embryos, embryonic stem cell lines, and live animals using cloning technologies has confirmed that sufficient reversal of differentiated fetal and adult genomes can be achieved.  However, high embryonic, fetal and neonatal deaths with abnormalities affecting the placenta, the respiratory and circulatory systems and growth of the fetus and neonate clone greatly lower the live birth rate to ~1-5% indicating that this reprogramming process is inadequate most of the time. 

     

This proposal outlines a continuing research program based on the hypothesis that the artificial and sub-optimal culture environments alter the chromatin structure and function of cells and embryos - modifications that are amplified and further altered during the in vitro manipulations and development of embryos, embryonic stem cells and live born animals derived from the cloning procedures.  The specific aims of this research program are to: 1) Enhance nuclear reprogramming of the donor genome; 2) Evaluate the efficiency of epigenetic and nuclear reprogramming; 3) Compare and contrast global gene expression patterns between embryo clones and fetuses with their in vitro fertilized (IVF) and in vivo produced counterparts.

     

Our unique combination of micromanipulation skills, various quantitative gene expression and chromatin structure analysis tools, and techniques for animal cloning and embryonic stem cell derivation and differentiation in multiple domestic species allow us to evaluate the efficacy and safety of somatic cell nuclear transfer technologies and permits improvements to help transfer this technology to applied endeavours.  This research program will improve our fundamental understanding of nuclear reprogramming events and may allow for strategies that will improve the live birth rates of domestic animal clones and to genetically evaluate embryonic stem stems for their potential uses in transplantation-based therapies.

"Breaking of seed dormancy, leading to germination, is under the control of plant hormones.  These cause changes in the expression of key genes, but first the hormone has to be recognized as a signal to induce these events. Elucidating the signal transduction pathway is key to our understanding of how hormones work, and for their useful application to improve agronomc traits.  Our research concentrates a pivotal protein component of this pathway, to determine how it functions, and how its action is controlled within the seed to promote germination.

All agricultural plants are affected adversely by lack of water.  We have identified a horticultural plant whose roots can withstand desiccation.  Related to this tolerance is the appearance in the roots of a small protein, in abundant quantities.  We are studying this protein, and its synthesis, with the intent of introducing it into intolerant temperate crop plants, in the expectation that it will increase their ability to withstand drought.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Plant Biology & Food Science",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Ceramic materials implanted into the body for repair or reconstruction of tissues are known as bioceramics.  One potential application is the use of porous bioceramics as controlled-release drug delivery devices.  Bioceramics with tailored microstructure have potential as long-term and/or variable rate drug delivery vehicles.  The success of these materials depends upon the ability to optimize the microstructure so as to release compounds at different stages of healing.  

   Resorbable bioceramic materials offer a solution to this problem, and do not requite secondary surgeries because they are designed to completely biodegrade over time.  Calcium Polyphosphate (CPP) is a promising candidate material for continuous long-term localized drug-delivery.  The release of drug from CPP matrices is a process that involves a dynamic interplay between the fluid absorbed from the environment and changes due to material degradation.

   While the use of CPP for the delivery of therapeutic agents has demonstrated significant initial success, challenges remain in terms of extending the release period, tailoring the release rate, and improving the mechanical strength.  Alternative processing/fabrication method are being developed; a process that would significantly benefit from a non-destructive technique that could directly provide quantitative feedback about the temporal and spatial evolution of the microstructural and transport properties.

   Utilizing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), it is therefore possible to simultaneously characterize both the material degradation process and the fluid/drug transport properties of bioceramics in situ.  This program will therefore apply MRI to the characterization of novel CPP drug delivery devices.  Studies will simultaneously involve the development and refinement of new MRI techniques, and the application of these methods to drug delivery bioceramics, including direct imaging of the drug itself.  Such information is crucial to the development of improved CPP devices.

   The ability to aid in the advancement of bioceramic technology will lead to new progress in this area, with the long-term clinical success of bioceramics potentially leading to an improved quality of life for millions of Canadians.

"Complex high-dimensional data arise in many important biological experiments, and the complexity continues to grow exponentially due to rapid advances in technology on how molecular information is generated. For example, it has now become routine to generate large-scale Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data, currently in the order of 500,000 to 1 million, to study potential association of genetic markers with complex traits and diseases. Another example, is large scale data arising in DNA gene expression microarrays, often measured on relatively few subjects. Although the volume of data from such experiments is large, important signals are typically few in number and finding the ""needles in the haystacks"" poses numerous analytical and practical challenges.



This proposal has three main components: (1) new methods for improved ranking of genes in the context of replicated time course microarray data, (2) methods for selecting maximally correlated data across different sources of information using sparse representation, and (3) improved method for biclustering. Although the scientific application focus is in high-throughput genomics, the methods are generic and can be applied to any large-scale and complex multivariate data.

"In my research program I work on software verification, which is a method that takes as input a program and gives the user feedback about possible bugs in the program. We already use such techniques today, in our compilers: they check if we use all variables and functions properly, according to their types and signatures, respectively. As a next step towards the ultimate goal of error-free programs, we develop the technology needed for checking semantical properties, e.g., if data structures on the heap are consistent, or if some forbidden variable value is possible during program execution. Theoretically, these checks are undecidable, but in practice, due to several recent breakthroughs in program verification, there is a strong hope that we can actually verify many interesting properties. The problem is identified and widely acknowledged as a grand challenge in computer science, and only an enormous effort of many research groups together can develop all the techniques that at the end make it possible to achieve the ideal of software engineering: verified software.

     However, it is not always possible to obtain the source code for all components of our system. This phenomenon naturally occurs if we build information systems based on web services. Different components, developed by different development teams, are running at different locations and on different computer platforms. Neither the source code nor the executable program is obtainable for inspection or in-house testing of certain components. In the proposed research, we are working on a new formalism, called web service interfaces, to formulate specifications of web services in a concise way, and develop a tool platform that supports modeling and analysis of web services based on our language. A provider of a web service can then offer to the clients a formal interface of its service. The provider can use the interface to check if the actual implementation fulfills all promises made by the interface. The client of the web service can use the provided interface to check if the client component is compatible with the interface. If both is given, then the overall composition is guaranteed to work. We will provide automatic procedures for both tasks.",Logiciel,"Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computing and Information Sciences - A",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Selected Topics in Discrete Geometry: Discrete geometry is a young and fast developing area on the border line of pure mathematics and computer science. The phrase discrete geometry, which at one time stood mainly for the areas of packing, covering and tiling, has gradually grown to include such areas as combinatorial geometry, convex polytopes, and arrangements of lines, circles, planes, spheres and other geometric objects in the plane and in higher dimensions. Also, discrete geometry has a number of applications in other fields such as in digital communications. Namely, one of the fundamental questions in communications theory is to determine the densest packing of equal balls in multidimensional space. Actually, the proposed research is a rather broad one investigating densest sphere packings in spherical space, curved analogues of convex polytopes called ball-polyhedra, (partial) coverings by cylinders and planks, illumination problems as well as (short) billiards of (convex) billiard tables. The proposed collaborators include my graduate students (resp., advanced undergraduate students) at the University of Calgary, the visitors of the Center for Computational and Discrete Geometry at the University of Calgary and leading researchers from institutions in Canada, USA and Europe.","Sciences math�matiques","Avancement des connaissances","Pure & Applied Maths - A",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"Security is an essential feature and foremost concern to Internet and enterprise distributed software applications. However, the adoption of secure distributed applications by commercial and government organizations is considerably hampered by the prohibitively high cost of ownership and the inability to support real-world applications and infrastructures. The general goal of my research is to explore new methods for designing and managing security mechanisms for large-scale distributed applications. Specifically, I will investigate new authorization architectures for medium-to-large enterprises (from hundreds to thousands of computers) that will be able to sustain frequent infrastructure failures and will reduce delays associated with making access control decisions. The proposed research will investigate an approach to increasing reliability and efficiency of enterprise-scale authorization solutions by flooding delivery channels with speculatively pre-computed authorizations and actively recycling them on a just-in-time basis. 

  The approach consists of three key elements. First is decoupling applications from their authorization servers using publish-subscribe technology. The administrative and operating overheads associated with reconfiguring access control systems to accommodate component and infrastructure failures should thereby be reduced. Second is ""active recycling"" of authorizations by searching through the publish-subscribe authorization streams and distributed caches in order to compute the ""best approximate"" (as opposed to  ""precise"") authorizations. Third is speculative pre-computation of authorizations and their distribution to policy enforcement points  through the publish-subscribe channels. The expected benefits of this approach are (1) improved resilience of authorization infrastructures in the light of the high failure rates observed in large enterprises; (2) reduced delay (latency) in requesting and obtaining authorizations; and (3) reduced human resources required to maintain enterprise-scale authorization infrastructures. Preliminary results demonstrate a 30% increase in the number of authorization requests that can be served without consulting the authorization server.

"Cooperative communication will be a key technique to enhance the data rate, network coverage (and hence reliability), and energy-saving performance in next generation broadband cellular wireless networks. The objective of this project is to develop advanced radio transmission and resource management techniques necessary for successful deployment of cooperative cellular wireless networks.  The specific topics to be considered include advanced transceiver design and coding schemes for cooperative communications, joint relay selection and resource allocation techniques, medium access control and quality of service provisioning, and inter-cell cooperation schemes for cooperative cellular wireless networks. 

The scientific approach will be based on sound research principles involving literature survey, and analytical modeling combined with extensive numerical analysis and computer simulation.  The outcome of the proposed research has the potential of making ground-breaking impact in shaping the broadband wireless industry of the future. It will have direct applications to the evolving next generation cellular wireless systems such as Third Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution (3GPP LTE) and multihop relaying WiMAX (IEEE 802.16j). As such, the results anticipated from this proposed research will be key strategic enablers for leading players of the Canadian telecommunications industry. Furthermore, training of skilled graduate students and technology transfer to the leading Canadian telecommunications industries is a major strength of our proposal.

"The long term goal of the proposed study is to design suitable reservoir flooding and heavy oil displacement

fluids for enhanced recovery of residual petroleum in depleted oil fields or of the Athabasca heavy oils and

bitumen. The specific aim of this exploratory project will be to test a small set of emulsions to be provided by

Quadrise Canada to assess their suitability as reservoir stimulating fluids, and identify the optimal formulation

for subsequent field study. The research will involve observing the breakthrough of an emulsion through a

packed bed of a model substrate (surface modified quartz grains) saturated with heavy oils. The grains will be

surface modified by silanizing their surfaces to alter their hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, and packed into a

column. Then the model emulsion will be injected into this packed bed, and the breakthrough behavior will be

studied. The emulsion breakthrough curves can be related to the properties of the packed medium, different

combinations of hydrophilicity/phobicity, and operating conditions, such as superficial velocity, pressure

pulsing, and temperature. The study will provide a simple proof of concept for the suitability of different

emulsion formulations in displacing the interstitial fluid present within the porous medium. The chemical

analysis of the eluted fluids will indicate how effectively the oil can be removed from the porous medium.

Results from this preliminary study will assist Quadrise Canada Ltd. to build synergies and collaborations with

Alberta's heavy oil and petroleum industry and introduce a novel low energy technology for enhanced oil

"Complex fluids are multi-component fluids, where different species present in the fluid interact with each other and the fluid surroundings. Such interactions impart novel properties to these fluids, such as phase separation, modification of viscosity, optical density, etc., and ability to respond differently to external forces, particularly electromagnetic.  Emulsions, slurries, wastewater, drug formulations, cosmetics, petrochemicals, and biological fluids such as blood are all examples of complex fluids. Some of the above, such as emulsions and biological fluids are characterized by the presence of deformable or flexible entities suspended in them. An emulsion droplet or a cell can deform due to interaction with other cells, as well as in presence of external forces.  The proposed research program will continue our efforts toward understanding the outcomes of interactions between the deformable colloidal components of complex fluids. A key focus of our studies will be to develop a predominantly experimental understanding of how external forces alter such interactions, leading to novel applications in the area of separation technologies. With our recently acquired micro particle image velocimetry and simultaneous static and dynamic light scattering facilities, and in conjunction with our existing atomic force microscope, we will characterize the interactions between components of liquid-liquid emulsions and association colloids (emulsions, vesicles, and surfactant stabilized droplets).  We will then subject these complex fluids to externally imposed DC and AC electric fields to elucidate their transport behaviour and structural modifications in presence of external forces. Finally, we will explore the phenomenon of AC dielectrophoresis in conjunction with membrane filtration to separate the components of complex fluids. The key applications of the proposed research are (i) in the development of novel approaches for improving oil sands extraction processes related to dewatering of the extracted bitumen, and (ii) in the development of novel separation technologies that can treat oily wastewaters produced in many industrial effluents and in the oil sands tailings.

"As a result of recent technological developments in distributed generation (DG) sources and with the advent of retail competition in the electric power industry, the role of the distribution companies (discos) has gradually evolved into a very important and critical one for a sound and efficient operation of the whole power system. The discos have affected market operations and improved competition and technical aspects of operation in addition to their contribution to service quality and reliability. In the same context, demand response programs/demand side management (DSM) are important policy tools that have an ability to alter power flow patterns within the distribution systems and contribute significantly to enhance the economic efficiency and secure operation for the whole system.

      In such an environment, the operational aspects in the short-term and planning issues in the long-term, for a disco, while responding to the dynamics of the electricity market and its price fluctuations need to be investigated. The contribution of DGs and DSM measures in disco operation and in reduction of feeder loss, capacity deferrals, reactive power compensation aspects, etc. are crucial.

      In this project, a distribution system optimal power flow model will be developed which will incorporate detailed feeder representations, possibility for feeder reconfiguration, penetration of DG sources, and reactive power switching aspects. Studies will be carried out to examine the role of DGs in both short-term

(operations) and long-term (planning) of the distribution grid- particularly its effect on reduction of feeder losses, feeder capacity expansion deferral, as well as optimal plans for its penetration into the distribution systems, islanding issues, pricing of its energy supply and various aspects of retail competition.","�nergie �lectrique","Ressources d'�nergie","Electromag. & Electr.

"PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS 



Artificial Intelligence (AI) has both engineering and scientific goals: (a) to develop systems that have some form of intelligence, and (b) to understand intelligent behavior in systems and living organisms. Since biological systems embody a marked degree of parallel and distributed functioning, we believe that the architectures of intelligent systems and/or their implementations should also embody some forms of parallel and distributed computing. The systems should also exhibit some fundamental features of evolution in nature. 



The long-term objective of our work has been to develop efficient models, algorithms and implementations of parallel and distributed intelligent systems. Our goal has been not only to develop and experiment with new algorithms, but to develop operational software systems that can be employed in the real world as well. Whenever opportunities arise, the outcomes of our research will be commercialized and integrated in products.



We propose: (a) to devise algorithms and software systems for efficient, effective, precise, semantic matching in e-Business, e-Learning and social networking environments, (b) to utilize knowledge (e.g. gene expression data, protein-protein interaction data and regulatory elements) about existing pathways of model organism to construct partial or complete regulatory networks for non-model organisms, and (c) to develop a semantically enriched dynamic knowledge delivery system for personal learning services.

"The ability of an individual to carry out multiple tasks concurrently has long been a central question in human cognition research. Such knowledge is important for both applied and fundamental cognition, as it may assist in our understanding of the limits of human cognition. In the laboratory, the dual-task paradigm is frequently used to study the ability to share or divide attention between concurrent tasks. A major source of debate in dual-task studies is whether two tasks really can be executed in parallel, or whether dual-task completion is rather based on switching strategies, such as holding the answer to one task in memory while completing a second task. Recently, studies have assessed the effect of extensive practice on dual-task performance in order to better understand the basic cognitive mechanisms underlying dual-task performance. Some studies have reported that practice enables participants to perfectly share their attention between two concurrent tasks. However, conflicting results have been reported, and substantial interindividual differences in the ability to coordinate two tasks have been observed. Another important question is whether getting faster and more accurate in the execution of concurrent tasks in the laboratory leads to benefits that generalize to multiple-tasks that have not been trained. The proposed research program will investigate such potential transfer effects after computer-based dual-task training. The research program will also address interindividual differences in the ability to share attention between tasks and to benefit from divided-attention training. The experiments proposed here are designed to enhance understanding of the mental processes underlying multiple-task performance, and how multi-tasking skills can be developed and improved. This approach will be used with both younger and older adults, as dual-task skills are affected by aging. It is believed that studying the relation that may exist between dual-tasking difficulties and other attentional deficits in older adults could help us understand how basic cognitive mechanisms sustain multiple-task performance, and how cognitive training can help to maintain and improve this ability.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"A string on a musical instrument vibrates at a characteristic pitch, or resonance frequency, when plucked; adding weight to the string (or choosing a thicker string) allows shift to a lower frequency.  Nanoresonators - strings or rods of diameter below a thousandth of a millimetre, show a measurable change in resonance frequency with added weight as small as that of a few biomolecules.  Biosensing for disease states such as cancer, acute inflammation and neurodegeneration in aging will greatly benefit from this extraordinary sensitivity of nanoresonators, which will enable early detection or sensitive treatment-monitoring.  These would lead to better outcomes for patients and to reduced healthcare costs.  The proposed studies of mechanical properties of materials and of air damping forces for nanoresonators in a rarefied environment, will aid biosensor design and will contribute fundamental knowledge in materials and fluid science, with broad applicability.



Thin metal films can show microsecond response to changes in heat rate. A thin-film thermocouple sensor for measuring thermal signatures from living cells is proposed.  Used with healthy and diseased cells, it will provide new information on cellular processes and the detection and treatment of disease.  A second thin-film sensor for fluctuating forces exerted by air or water in turbulent flow past a solid surface, will enable studies leading to more accurate, affordable, computer models for atmospheric flow patterns and vehicle fuel economy through flow drag reduction.



In summary, the proposed research has strong potential to reduce avoidable patient suffering and healthcare costs, to create tools to respond to global climate chaos and to improve fuel economy.  The research program aims to contribute to basic science and the economy in Canada, and to shape well-trained new researchers.

"Engineering organizations participating in the design and development of complex aerospace products require a shift in culture to ensure that they respond to customer expectations for affordability and quality and to maintain long-term viability. Among the many approaches to engineering product development (PD) improvement, 'lean engineering' is of particular interest. The goal of this project is to apply lean principles to the design phase of the PD process. There are three overall research tasks whose specific objectives are to develop: a) models for correct sizing of design work packages; b) a model measuring PD performance; and c) tools for target costing and life-cycle costing. The research in project a) will model the value stream of the PD process and investigate how task size impacts work flow, throughput, and work in progress.  Lean principles will be applied to improve flow and reduce cycle time by choosing appropriate task size at the different stages in the PD process. The goal is to achieve savings of 25% of the intellectual work in progress inherent in PD. Project b) will model the performance of PD in terms of the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness required to direct efforts and resources, and to assess whether the anticipated improvements have materialized. PD performance is dependent on multiple criteria, including engineering job size, job type, risk level and scope, lead time, and rework. Project c) will develop a set of tools and techniques that will allow better design to cost. Lean principles will be applied to match costing with project and process objectives. Tools will be able to look at the design implications of life cycle costs, which include: design requirements, implementation, support, and continuous upgrades during product life. A closed-loop methodology will be developed that will model product function and target costs, and then address variances in order to bring design implementation in alignment with cost targets. Results from the research will be valuable to both the academic and industrial communities for the better management, understanding and implementation of lean principles for collaborative work and will accelerate the adoption of lean practices in the aerospace industry.

"Fuel cell technology is one of the most promising candidates for achieving the fuel economy and emission reduction goals. One of the key technical callenges for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells in automotive applications is the water management. The balance of water in a PEM fuel cell is critical to PEM fuel cell operation, and its implications are not yet fully understood. The membrane within a PEM cell needs to be fully hydrated in order to reduce ohmic losses caused by the resistance across the membrane. Thus cell or stack dehydration reduces the proton conductivity of the membrane. Too much water leads to flooding of the cell and which impedes the mass transfer of reactant gases, and block catalyst sites.



The overall objective of this project is to apply a water crossover diagnosis tool developed jointly by Ballard and UBC to study water tansfer across different membrane and gas diffusion layers in order to understand mechanism of water transfer across membrane and its relationship with the degradation of cell performance, as well as the effect of membrane properties on the water transfer characteristics. Furthermore, the experimental data generated from this novel unit will be used to validate a fuel cell performance model so that the model can be used to assist in the optimization of the fuel cells.



This research project will contribute to the understanding of local water transfer behaviour in PEM fuel cells. The experiments will provide specific water formation and transfer information to AFCC's commercial PEM fuel cells, especially for the cases when water drops are present in the exhaust gas stream. The validated model will serve as an important design and diagnostic tool for water management in PEM fuel cells in order to improve their stability and durability. Overall, this project will contribute to the development of the fuel cell industry in Canada.","�nergie �lectrique","Ressources d'�nergie","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"The goal of the proposed research is to develop biologically-based technologies that can capture waste CO2 while producing a high-valued product. The revenue from the sale of the high-valued product could be used to offset the cost of the CO2 capture. Thus, this technology would provide financial incentives for companies to reduce their CO2 emissions. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, would be the biological component of the CO2 capture system, and we will demonstrate the production of a high-valued product through the production of enzymes. However, our proposed technology could also be used to produce bioplastics and biodiesel.There are two main components to the proposed research. One is the development of closed bioreactor designs suitable for industrial plants emitting hot effluent that is rich in CO2. The other main component of the proposed research is the development of cyanobacteria that can produce recombinant enzymes.

"Dielectric powders such as polyethylene resins may acquire electrostatic charges during various powder

processing (e.g. polymerization reaction, drying, granulation, coating, separation and dispersion) operations,

which may give rise to difficulties in powder handling and powder flow, e.g. agglomeration, mainly due to

adhesion/cohesion/agglomeration effects. Highly charged powders may adhere to walls of the processing

equipment, leading to equipment fouling, or agglomerate to form polymer sheets in polyethylene reactors.

Charging characteristics of polymer powders are affected by many physiochemical factors such as particle size,

size distribution, density, morphology and hygroscopicity, and operational environmental conditions such as

relative humidity, temperature and pressure. Since 1998, we have investigated the charge generation due to

bi-polarization of polyethylene powders of wide size distributions, and found that fine powders gained opposite

charges to the coarse powders in fluidized bed reactors. The selective removal of fine powders by entrainment

will cause the buildup of charges of opposite signs in the reactor. In the proposed work, we will investigate the

effect of electrostatics on the entrainment of fine powders in fluidized bed reactors, and develop a

mathematical model to simulate the effect of powder charging on flow behaviour of gas and particles in the

reactor, as well as testing different charge mitigation techniques. The proposed work is expected to lead to

improved understanding of particle charging in commericial polymerization reactors and the development of

novel charge mitigation technologies.","Polym�res, caoutchouc et plastiques","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Major efforts are currently underway on utilizing the spin- and charge degrees of freedom of an electron at the same time, as this holds great promises for building devices.  An everyday example of such a spintronic device is the magnetoresistive read head used in todays harddrives.  In order to make further progress in tailoring materials for spintronic, we need to achieve a better understanding of how magnetic moments are formed in low carrier density systems. This makes it possible to tune the magnetic and electric properties of a compound at the same time.



While we have today a good understanding on how magnetic moments are formed when they are well localized, our understanding is much less complete when the magnetism arises from the spin-polarization of different parts of the Fermi surface. For gaining this understanding good model systems are needed. As new materials are always at the origin of discoveries in condensed matter

physics, the goal of this proposal is  to study three classes of compounds in order to find new routes towards engineering spintronic materials: B20 structure silicides, half-Heusler compounds, and Europium based  divalent hexaborides.  More precisely, we plan to open three new routes to magnetism in low carrier density systems. For achieving this goal we will study the underlying physics with crystal chemistry methods such as doping series.

"Energy sustainability, greenhouse gas production that lead to climate change, environmental emissions, peak oil, and long-term energy security are important energy drivers that societies need to address as we accumulate various risks that will impact future generations as a result of our strong reliance on fossil fuels. The common

research themes of the Alternative Energy Chair are to focus on innovative technologies that can be commercially implemented to increase the renewable energy ratio of Canada, thereby addressing energy drivers simultaneously. For the last 30 years, Canada has derived 16% of its primary energy from renewable sources. The Chair research program will focus mainly on renewable energy technologies that can be implemented to

increase the renewable energy ratio in Canada. Four research themes will be investigated to achieve this goal:



1. use of district energy systems using solar, biomass and enhanced geothermal to displace natural gas and electricity used for heating and cooling

2. development of in-stream kinetic turbine technologies in cold climates to generate power

3. bioenergy combined heat and power systems to achieve the highest revenue per bone dry ton for energy production from biomass

4. plug-in hybrid vehicles with production of new renewable power to displace motor fuels.



The fundamental understanding obtained from this research will provide a foundation for developing new alternative-energy applications, some of which may have significant commercial value in the near future. In addition, the research will lead to strategies to increase the renewable energy ratio that can be integrated as part of energy planning within Canadian utilities.

"There is a renewed interest in magnesium (Mg) alloys in the automotive, aircraft and 3C (communications, computer and consumer electronics) industries. Magnesium alloys are ~35% lighter than aluminum and ~80% lighter than steel. As a result, utilization of magnesium alloys in new products plays a critical role in reducing the overall product weight. In the case of automobiles, Mg alloys can provide a significant improvement in a vehicle's fuel efficiency and performance. Unfortunately, there are currently only a limited number of Mg casting alloys used in this sector due to their poor mechanical behavior at elevated temperatures ( > 150C).



The proposed research envisages development of novel magnesium alloys for components operating at elevated temperatures (up to 170C). To enable alloy development, extensive mechanical testing and alloy processing experiments need to be conducted. One essential component of alloy development is the characterization of alloy microstructure and subsequent development of ""processing-performance-microstructure"" relationships. Currently, there are no suitable instruments at UBC-Okanagan to enable accurate microstructural characterization of metals.



The requested funding is for the purchase of an inverted optical microscopy system with polarized light and differential interference contrast capabilities. Image analysis of the micrographs will allow for a detailed quantitative characterization of alloy structure, particle morphology, second phases, alloy defects and oxide inclusions. The microscope and image analysis will be extensively used for multi-disciplinary research. Further, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in microstructure characterization and gain a hands-on experience with an essential tool used in many engineering industries.

"Arm amputation is a rare condition which involves lifelong adaptation.  People who are missing an arm must adapt how they approach activities.  Sometimes this adaptation will make use of a prosthesis to replace some of the functions of the missing limb.  There is considerable debate as to the value of prosthetic limbs, particularly for children and adults with below elbow limb loss.



Our centre fits children and adults from across Atlantic Canada with prosthetic arms.  Over the past few years we have been developing quantitative measures of how much body postures need to be adapted to use different types of prosthesis.  In particular we have examined how different wrists affect posture when doing tasks.   Our hypothesis has been that more flexible wrists will require less extreme postures to put the hand into functional positions.  Our test group has been children between the ages of 4 and 13.  We have studied a large number of normally-limbed children to provide baselines and we have studied children who use the wrists when they come to our clinic for fittings or repairs.  Early on, we discovered that the typical table top tasks used in ergonomic assessments were not very exciting for these children so we have developed a group of gross motor tasks such as swinging and riding a bike which are hard to do one handed but which are a lot of fun.



Our work suggests that the more flexible wrists do require less postural adaptation.  We have been challenged by other clinical centres to apply our technology to measure postural changes in children attempting these tasks without prostheses.  This is important because long term use of awkward postures has the potential to lead to joint, back and neck problems later in life which may limit how well these children will function when they are adults.

"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a very powerful research tool based on the detection of electromagnetic signals that emanate from the nuclei of certain atoms.  The frequency of these signals are uniquely linked to the magnetic environment in which the atoms are situated and as such can provide very precise information about a wide variety of physical, chemical, biological, and material properties. For example, the NMR signal from hydrogen atoms in our bodies can be detected non-invasively and used to locate and diagnose injury or disease. This technique, known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is one of the most important tools in modern medicine.



In recent years it has been demonstrated that xenon gas, when specially prepared using a method called optical pumping, has a particularly strong NMR signal and is particularly well suited for MR imaging of the lung.  We are developing a research program to further explore the NMR and MRI applications of xenon gas.  In particular, we plan to use a very sensitive device, known as a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device or SQUID, to detect the xenon signal. This will allow us to develop ultra-sensitive measurement techniques and instrumentation, which could be used, for example, to study lung physiology and disease with unprecedented resolution.

"Over the past several years, we have witnessed rapid advances in communications and computing. Photonics has emerged as the technology of choice for almost all long-haul and metro area communication networks due to its large bandwidth capacity. On the contrary, photonics components have not been able to replace copper wires in computers and local area networks. This resulted in computer CPUs having instruction execution speeds that greatly exceed the speed of processor-to-processor and processor-to-memory links by ever increasing margins, creating a performance bottleneck. A radically new approach is required to overcome bottlenecks in computing and local area networks. Recent progress in the design and manufacture of interconnects clearly shows that planar photonic interconnects have the potential to change the information transfer and computing infrastructure in Canada and worldwide. The central objective of this proposal is to research fundamental science required to create novel algorithms to synthesize, simulate, and visualize planar photonic interconnects. A special emphasis will be put on establishing the path towards automatic synthesis of net topology directed at achieving capabilities to build large-scale optical circuits similar to the ones that have been developed to build electronics chips. This will be achieved through developing custom code and supplementing it with finite element method solvers and beam propagation algorithms. These tools will be deployed on high-performance computational platforms to synthesize and simulate the performance of optical interconnects. The project is expected to train highly qualified personnel in Canada. The ultimate goal of the project is to produce a new generation of professionals that will take charge in the design and deployment of novel photonic interconnect architectures. This proposal is expected to generate commercial interest from industry leaders in building photonic processors for the access telecommunication market.

"The commercially important ascomycetous insect pathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae has an extremely wide distribution and can be easily recovered from soils of different climates and ecological settings such as forested or agricultural habitats (Roberts & St. Leger, 2004). Recently, M. anisopliae has been shown to be plant rhizosphere competent, with evidence that it can adhere to, and colonize, plant roots strongly suggesting an alternate role in the plant rhizosphere.  M. anisopliae upregulates a specific subset of genes when grown in the presence of bean root exudate. The best studies of these is Mad2, which encodes a plant adhesin. In the presence of insect cuticle it upregulates a different subset of genes, including Mad1, which encodes for an insect cuticle adhesin. This fungus appears to have, at least, a bifunctional lifestyle. The objective of this proposal is to further investigate the association of this insect pathogenic fungus with plant roots. What types of associations does it have as a rhizoplane fungus? Do different genotypes of M. anisopliae show differing abilities to form associations with different plant species? Is this a mutualistic association where the fungus provides insect nitrogen to the plant in exchange for carbon? Does M. anisopliae afford plant protection from root feeding insects? This proposal represents a shift in the wider understanding of the role these fungi play in the soil ecosystem, particularly the role they play in the plant rhizosphere. Elucidating the association of this fungus with plants could generate alternate ideas of nutrient cycling in plants, particularly nitrogen cycling.  This fungal-insect-plant association could also contribute to the utility of fungi as insect pathogens particularly for insect pests that destroy plant roots.   The overall objective of this proposal is to increase our understanding of the association of insect pathogenic fungi with host plants and the mechanisms of these associations. This is a particularly novel proposal since it investigates the tripartite interaction of fungus-insect-plant, which could be of significance since certain insect pathogenic fungi could have a role in plant protection.

"The immunomodulatory effects of rewarding brain stimulation have important functional implications applicable to several central conditions including depression and other stress-related disorders. For example, it has recently been shown that brain stimulation applied to certain structures reduces the depressive symptoms in humans who do not respond to traditional forms of treatment. Understanding the fundamental nature of the relationship between reward and immunological processes is basic to the development of such novel therapies. Protective effects have also been observed as a consequence of environmental enrichment, but there is little data related to its immunological and endocrine influences. In our studies, the expression of sickness behaviours as a consequence of endotoxin challenge differs according to group designation in that animals receiving rewarding brain stimulation display no illness behaviours, roughly half of the animals in the environmental enrichment condition display illness behaviours, and all animals in the control group display illness behaviours. Unlike brain stimulation reward, in which thresholds indicate the rewarding value of the stimulation, there is no index of enrichment to evaluate individual animal responses to their environment. For animals in subordinate positions, for example, the group experience may be less satisfying than for animals in more dominant positions, and affect immunocompetence. The long-term goals of this proposal are to include variables such as age, genetic, and sex differences to determine the contribution of these factors to immunocompetency. Most studies using animal models do not stratify by sex, although it is well-known that there are sex differences in adaptive and innate immunity. Given our general interest in examining the influence of the unique immunological and endocrine profiles associated with females, our studies will be expanded to include both female and male groups.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"Proteins have an essential role to play in virtually all biological processes, participating in an extraordinarily diverse set of chemical reactions and physical tasks. Consequently, there is interest within a wide variety of research disciplines to understand the origin and evolution of the functional properties of proteins.  Two problems are ever-present in the analysis of proteins: (i) estimating the evolutionary history of the gene sequences, and (ii) learning about the processes that have shaped the protein's function over time.  Models of protein evolution, applied within a formal statistical framework, have proved to be a powerful means of addressing these problems. Under this research program, several different approaches will be employed to improve the realism of protein models.  Our primary focus will be modeling the structure of the amino acid rate matrix and its variability among sites within a gene. We will assess the impact of putative improvements with respect to model-based inferences such as phylogenetics and the identification of positively selected sites. 

     Ultimately, the improved models will be employed to: (i) improve the precision and power of model-based methods for estimating the strength and direction of natural selection pressure, (ii) improve estimates of phylogenetic history obtained from genome-scale datasets, (iii) investigate adaptive divergence between pathogenic bacteria and their non pathogenic relatives, and (iv) assess novel metabolic diversity among uncultivable microbes.  Due to the central role of proteins in so many biological processes, the impact of this research is likely to extend well beyond the above applications.

Among lentiviruses, only the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) utilize a combination of ubiquitous chemokine and specific T-cell receptors for viral entry, and cause immunodeficiency in their natural hosts. FIV has co-evolved with domestic and wild cats for a longer time than HIV has with humans, and disease associated with FIV infection develops more gradually in cats than immunodeficiency in HIV-infected people. Further, some cats infected with FIV do not get ill at all, while most others eventually succumb to the disease. Identifying feline host factors that modulate this response to infection is of great interest for designing prophylactic or therapeutic HIV interventions. Therefore, in this research we will investigate why some cats develop either no or only mild immunodeficiency from infection with FIV. First, we will determine differences in the make-up of viruses that cause disease and those that don't cause disease by molecular examination of the viral proteins and their modifications. Next, we will examine how these different viruses alter the function of dendritic cells (DC), which are the ""master"" regulators of the immune response. Finally, we will investigate how the immune system, and specifically how helper and cytotoxic lymphocytes, respond to the different viruses. These studies will give us insight into whether trying to manipulate the early phase of immunodeficiency virus infection through increasing DC function, or reducing immune activation, may improve the outcome of infection. Further, these studies will clarify whether the nature and degree of the host immune response determines the onset of immunodeficiency, and how important the composition of the particular virus is.

"Hybrid ligands in mono- and binuclear transition metal complexes offer unique opportunities for applications in homogenous catalysis, materials chemistry and bioinorganic research. The common theme that binds these diverse applications lies in ligand design. The Bierenstiel research group develops new series of hybrid ligands that contain both hard and soft donor atoms, such as nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S), respectively. The targeted N,S-hybrid ligands will be investigated for their hemilability property, a concept pivotal to catalysis, their ability to bind to early (hard) and late (soft) transition metals and their non-innocent redox-activity as these ligands participate actively in electron transfer processes. 



The conceptual novelty of the Bierenstiel research program is that it represents the first systematic investigation of the fundamental principles of unfolding of a mononuclear chelate to a binuclear complex. The new transition metal complexes have anticipated metal-ligand and metal-metal interactions that can be utilized in applications such as homogenous catalysis, new electronic and magnetic materials, and as biomimetic metalloenzyme models. The central theme of the research program is the design of N,S-hybrid ligands that are accessible through a modular synthetic approach. This modular approach provides also the feasibilty at a primarily undergraduate institution. While initial studies focus predominantly on group 10 metals such as nickel (Ni), palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt), the research can be expanded to any transition metal, or metal combination, due to the nature of the targeted N,S-hybrid ligands.

"Our materials discovery program focuses on magnetic materials, ion conductors and photocatalysts. We emphasize the importance of solid state preparation methods for the discovery and modification of these materials. The in-depth investigations of solid state reaction pathways provides opportunities to alter extended structures, control oxidation states and trap metastable and intermediate structures. Systems of interest range from transition metal oxides, oxychlorides to sulfychlorides. These systems permit rationalizing magnetic and electronic properties in ceramics as a function of their structures. Materials' properties strongly depend on solid state structures, it is therefore crucial to reliably determine crystalline solid state structures. Powder X-ray and neutron diffraction are particularly powerful methods for the investigation of these phases. The recent progress in diffraction instrumentation and analysis software allows to follow solid state reactions in real-time. Using in-situ powder X-ray diffraction we are investigating solid state reaction pathways during phase formation, reduction and oxidation of transition metal oxides such as vanadates and vanadites with zircon, perovskite, bixbyite, defect fluorite and pyrochlore structures. In-situ experiments will improve our understanding and will aid the optimization of solid state synthesis methods. We also investigate rare-earth transition metal chalcogenidechlorides as model compounds for low-dimensional magnetism. In oxychlorides low-dimensional paramagnetic sublattices are formed by means of anisotropic magnetic exchange paths due to anion ordering. Systems under investigation encompass oxychlorides and sulfychlorides with ordered and disordered anion lattices as well as transition metal oxides representing single anion lattices. These model systems provide an opportunity to evaluate the impact of anion ordering on magnetic exchange interactions in extended solids. We also investigate crystallographic phase transitions in oxides. The research program combines a large synthetic component with the investigation of physical properties in order to identify structure-property relations in solids

"Singularities in mathematics describe irregularities of spaces and functions, in the same way that a singularity in everyday language means an irregularity of an object or of behaviour. Singularity is thus a basic idea in most mathematical disciplines and their applications. The important features of an object are often concentrated at the singularities. The goal of my research is to better understand singularities using the powerful tools of several areas of mathematics -- algebra, analysis and geometry.



Many important questions in mathematics depend on the class of spaces or functions considered (algebraic, analytic, differentiable,...). I have tried to take a universal approach, developing a ""differential calculus"" for singular spaces, that applies simultaneously to the various classes. This has led to the discovery of unexpected links among algebraic, combinatorial and analytic aspects of singularities, and to the solution of problems of Whitney, Thom and Hironaka -- the pioneers of singularity theory.



My relatively elementary algorithm for resolution of singularities (projection onto a singular object of a space that is smooth, or nonsingular) helps to unravel the hidden features of singular spaces. It opens a previously inaccessible area, and provides techniques to attack fundamental problems in diverse areas like logic and analysis.



The problems that I am working on are potentially important in the physical and information sciences. Efficient implementation of algorithms for resolution of singularities, for example, is an active area of research in computer algebra.

"This grant will be used to purchase two pieces of equipment: (1) a rotary evaporator, and (2) a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) instrument. These instruments will be critical components of a research program focusing on plant pathogenic Streptomyces bacteria that cause potato common scab, which is an economically-important plant disease in Canada. Potato scab is characterized by raised corky-like lesions that form on the surface of potato tubers. These lesions affect the marketability of the potato crop leading to significant economic losses for potato growers. The equipment funded by this grant will be used to identify, quantify and purify natural products that are produced by the best characterized scab-causing pathogen, Streptomyces scabies, and which contribute to the pathogenic character of this organism. The goal of this research is to better understand how these natural products are produced by S. scabies, how they function in disease development, and the environmental conditions that promote the synthesis of the molecules. The results of this research will shed further light on the importance of S. scabies natural products in scab disease development, which has applications for the development of more effective scab management strategies. Another research program that will benefit from the use of this equipment is one that focuses on microbial antibiotic production and new drug discovery. This research program aims to better understand how antibiotics are produced by soil microorganisms so that strategies can be designed to enhance their production for commercial purposes. Furthermore, it aims to characterize new microbial natural products that may be useful as drugs for the treatment of human diseases. The equipment requested will also be important for two additional research programs, one of which studies the involvement of small signaling molecules in virus-mediated genetic exchange in bacteria, and the other which characterizes plant responses to stress. Thus, the instruments funded by this grant will support research programs that have applications to agriculture, biotechnology and medicine, and which also contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Genes, Cells and Molecules",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Newfoundland and Labrador",Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador

"Self-renewal is the division of a cell that results in the generation of a daughter cell with identical properties as the parental cell. This property is characteristic for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), enabling them to maintain the stem cell pool for the supply of blood cells throughout the life-time of an organism, and memory T and B cells. Memory T and B cells are responsible for long-term protection of the organism against re-infection. They develop from lymphocytes that are activated for immune response upon contact with viral or bacterial molecules. These lymphocytes undergo a massive expansion and differentiation to eliminate the pathogen. Most of them die after, but a few escapes and become memory lymphocytes that slowly turn over or self-renewal. The molecular mechanism that regulates self-renewal processes in HSCs and memory B and T cells is poorly known. Recent studies suggest that the same genes might control self-renewal in both HSCs and memory T-cells. One gene, Hoxb4, has been found to expand HSC populations, thus determining self-renewal divisions of HSCs. We hypothesize that Hoxb4 also expand the population of memory T cells. We will use a mouse model to analyse the effect of Hoxb4 on self-renewal expansion of memory T cells. If Hoxb4 determines self-renewal of memory T cells, we could not only use Hoxb4 to expand memory T cells for therapeutic use, but the more accessible memory T-cells could serve as a model to elucidate downstream targets of Hoxb4 driven self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells and provide a source of cells to identify interacting proteins of Hoxb4 in self-renewal function as well.

"Reliable electricity supply is an important requirement in a modern society and reliability assessment is therefore an important function in the planning, design and operation of electric power systems.  Reliability assessment provides important input to the investment decisions associated with providing customers with a reasonable level of reliability at an acceptable cost.  The general and long term objectives of the proposed program are to conduct research to further enhance the available techniques, and develop new techniques, to conduct reliability assessment in planning and operating electric power systems. The changing electric power utility environment has created considerable uncertainty in long-range planning and system operation.  These changes include the unbundling and re-regulation of traditional utility structures and the need to evaluate and incorporate renewable energy sources in the provision of reliable supply.  Unbundling and re-regulation has resulted in the creation of new entities, such as independent system operators and transmission operators, with new functions and responsibilities that require new reliability assessment tools and protocols.  One of the most exciting challenges in the immediate future will be to actually integrate renewable energy sources into the planning and operation of electric power systems rather than simply add them in response to the need for ""clean"" electrical energy.  Renewable electric energy sources are important and valuable resources that require new models and techniques to facilitate their optimum utilization in an electric power system.  This is an exciting area of research with important societal implications.  The specific objectives of this research program are the development of concepts and techniques to evaluate the reliability of generation, transmission and distribution systems incorporating renewable energy facilities.  Considerable work has been done on methods to incorporate wind and solar energy facilities in generating capacity reliability evaluation.  Further work is required, however, to assess the reliability and economic implications associated with increased penetration of wind power in electric power systems consisting of more conventional generation.

"The identification and understanding of physiological mechanisms and factors involved in the control of voluntary movements or standing posture is important to various fields, including rehabilitation sciences, sports sciences, and others. Neuromuscular fatigue is a phenomenon experienced in everyday activities and could interfere with optimal movement or standing balance. However, the effect of fatigue on determinants of optimal standing balance has not been studied systematically in old adults. This program of research aims at providing valuable novel information on factors important for the control of standing posture in old age, and how they are affected by fatigue.

"Geometric Function Theory is a classical yet thriving area of Modern Analysis. Recently, its technique found numerous applications to various areas of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics. The proposed research is mainly focused on two of these applications. These applications should also provide new approaches to the classical problems of the Geometric Function Theory itself.

   The first application is related to the recently discovered (1998) structure of conformally invariant objects, the Schramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLE). These objects are conjectured, and, in certain cases, proved to be the scaling limits of various Lattice Models of Statistical Physics. We plan to use the methods of the Geometric

Function Theory in two ways. We plan to establish the conjectured scaling limit behavior for Lattice Models using conformally-invariant observables. In addition, we plan to rigorously investigate the fine multifractal properties of SLE already established on the physics level. A study of the latter problem for a

variant of SLE driven by Levy processes can provide the conjectured optimal example for the multifractal spectra of harmonic measure for planar domains.

   Another application deals with the computational complexity of conformal maps. Conformal maps are extensively used in practice. One of the most celebrated appearances of conformal maps is probably Computer Tomography. Thus, it is important to find efficient algorithms for computing them. We plan to find the optimal

bounds on the computational complexity of such an algorithm.

   In the study, we again plan to make a heavy use of the Potential Theory and Geometric Function Theory. In addition to these two applications, we also plan to continue the study of the sharp bounds on the multifractal spectra of harmonic measure for planar domains. This study is closely related to such celebrated problems in Geometric Function Theory as Brennan conjecture and Carleson-Jones conjecture.

"Considerable research has established a size effect in shear for reinforced concrete members without web reinforcement, where the shear stress at failure decreases with an increase in the member depth and/or a drop in the aggregate size. Research has also shown a decrease in the shear capacity for members constructed with lightweight aggregates and, for high strength concrete. The addition of steel or polymeric fibers into the matrix will help reduce crack widths, control crack spacing and provide an alternate shear force transfer mechanism. These benefits are expected to mitigate size effects in shear for fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) in comparison with similar members without fibers. The proposed project will develop several normal and high strength concrete mixes with and without fibers, using locally available cements and aggregates. Size effects will be examined for the constitutive response of FRC in compression, indirect tension, and direct shear. Using selected mixes, shear-critical beam specimens without conventional web reinforcement will be studied to characterize member response in shear, building upon the material models developed earlier. In each phase of this study, geometrical scale factor of 1:4 (or higher) will be used to assess the size effect. The results will be analyzed to develop analytical models and design guidelines for FRC members subjected to flexure and shear. This study will be conducted at the University of Alberta, in collaboration with the Cement Association of Canada and NSERC Canada.

This proposal envisages three primary objectives: 

1. to characterize the constitutive response of concrete with/without fibers, for normal and high strength mix designs.

2. to evaluate size effects on the structural response of fiber reinforced concrete beams and slabs.

3. to develop design guidelines for fiber reinforced concrete members subjected to combined flexure and shear.

"Goal-directed action is one of the most basic yet necessary behaviours for people to acquire and perform throughout their lifetime. However, even the simple act of reaching to grasp an object (coffee cup or car keys) requires interaction between the sensory, cognitive and neuro-muscular systems. These systems must jointly perform a number of tasks: information about objects must be selectively gathered from the sensory environment, responses must be selected and prepared, and movements must be rapidly and accurately controlled. Specifically, we will examine the integration, organization and precedence of different types of visual information (e.g., texture, eye-position), as well as the degree of conscious access to these information sources. Thus, the goal of the present research program is to investigate how the brain manages - both structurally and functionally - the organization of complex sensory inputs to produce coherent and purposeful action.

"The long-term goal of my research is to understand the biosynthesis, transport, and storage of plant natural products (secondary metabolites). Plants are an important resource for a vast array of chemicals that serve us in industrial and health-related applications. Over 11% of the 252 drugs identified as essential by the World Health Organization are from higher plants; more still are synthetic derivatives obtained from natural precursors. Many industrial applications rely on plant-derived oils and waxes, such as Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) wax esters which are used as a lubricant in high-pressure applications such as automobile transmissions. The biosynthesis of health-related and economically important plant natural products is an active area of research, however less is known about the cellular aspects of biosynthesis. Often, the site of accumulation of a secondary metabolite is physically separated from the site of biosynthesis; many of these compounds are toxic to the cell and must be carefully stored. An understanding of the localization and transport of natural products will be essential for bioengineering of secondary metabolic pathways in plants.  I am studying two model systems: wax secretion in Arabidopsis thaliana and artemisinin biosynthesis and transport in Artemisia annua.  The waxy cuticle is a protective layer protecting the plant from pathogens and drought; and understanding of the cuticle is very important for agriculture. Artemisia annua is the source of artemisinin, an important anti-malarial drug, but the rising cost of production is making this drug difficult to obtain for many in the developing world, where it is most needed.  Towards this understanding, the initial focus of my research will be on ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which have been shown to play a key role in the transport and sequestration of many different secondary metabolites in many species. Characterization of these ABC transporters will be useful for producing pest and/or drought-resistant crops; improving artemisinin production through crop improvement or bioengineering applications.  Moreover, understanding transport in these systems will provide clues to understanding the cell biology of plant natural products in general.

"The Piano Design Lab is a unique, innovative facility that conducts leading-edge research to study the physical behaviour of the piano in relation to design principles, materials, and manufacturing techniques. A predictive simulation model has been developed for the dynamics of the piano action, the mechanism which converts the keyboard input from the pianist to motion of  the hammers which strike the strings. The proposed research will extend this work by incorporating it into an integrated dynamic model of the whole piano from pianist through to the mechanical and acoustic response. New model components will be developed for the hammer-string impact, vibrating strings, and soundboard assembly, as well as the many complex interactions between these that characterize the sound of a piano. Noise components generated by the action during playing and transmitted through the piano structure to the soundboard will also be represented, as these are an important component of piano tone. All of our models are extensively validated using a variety of sophisticated experimental techniques, including motion analysis of high-speed digital videos. Simulation software based on the model will provide a means to explore the physical relationship between the pianist and the instrument, as well as a tool for piano engineers to predict the influence of design factors and material properties without having to build expensive prototypes. With more generality, the engineering know-how developed from this research is also applicable in a wide range of industrial sectors important to Canada's economy, such as advanced manufacturing, mechatronics, robotics, and other industrial technologies.","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Mechanical Engineering - A",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"The cellular functions of a vast majority of proteins are performed through physical interactions with other proteins. These protein-protein interactions are essential for many cellular and biological processes. Therefore, the inhibition of these interactions with chemical compounds provides tremendous potential for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents and the development of innovative molecular tools to improve our understanding of biochemical pathways. As a result, the demand for molecules that are able to selectively disrupt specific protein-protein interactions is rapidly increasing.



The equipment requested herein, an analytical and purification high-performance liquid chromatography system (HPLC), will allow the development of novel approaches for the synthesis of engineerable peptidomimetic macrocyclic molecular scaffolds to target specific protein-protein interactions. The HPLC system will play a vital role in the laboratory of medicinal chemistry and will be used for purity analysis and purification of the synthesized molecules. Highly pure compounds are essential in structural studies, binding assays and for biological activity evaluation. As a result, the purification step is crucial for the development of selective protein-protein interaction inhibitors.  



The development of protein-protein interaction inhibitors is a challenging and important goal in the context of fundamental research and pharmaceutical lead discovery. The development of these novel engineerable peptidomimetic macrocyclcic scaffolds will open new possibilities to inhibit intracellular proteins and will have an important impact in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and life sciences since protein-binding molecules are potential pharmacological agents, molecular tools to study biochemical pathways, and protein capture agents for the purification or detection of proteins in complex mixtures.

"Skeletal muscle rapidly adapts to variations of the functional demand with a remarkable plasticity that can be evidenced by changes in capillarity and myofibres' properties. 

Myofibres produce vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), a key initiator of muscular angiogenesis, i.e. the de novo synthesis of blood capillaries. VEGF-A also ensures the maintenance of established capillaries. During skeletal muscle remodeling, myofibres could thus adjust muscle capillarity mainly by modulating VEGF-A expression that would in turn either enhance angiogenesis or induce vascular regression. 

However this relationship between myofibres, VEGF-A and capillaries is likely much more complex. Recent evidences suggest that the modulation of muscle capillarity, secondary to VEGF-A expression by myofibres, could control changes in the myofibres' contractile phenotype. In addition, recent data have shown that VEGF-A could also affect the metabolic properties of muscle cells. I therefore hypothesize that VEGF-A expression by myofibres will affect both their contractile and metabolic phenotypes during skeletal muscle remodeling.

Moreover, regression, maintenance or stimulation of muscle capillarity cannot be explained by VEGF-A alone. Among angiogenesis factors, the vascular endothelial growth factor-B and angiomotin are highly expressed in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, their action is not restricted to capillarity regulation only. I thus hypothesize that aside from their involvement in angiogenesis, these molecules could play a role in muscle cells remodeling.

The overall aim of my research program is to investigate whether VEGF-A, VEGF-B and angiomotin, initially described during angiogenesis, play a dual role on capillaries and myofibres. Thus, by acting on both endothelial cells and myocytes, they could be of critical importance for muscle remodeling. The program presented in this NSERC proposal will bring new knowledge in understanding the fundamental roles played by these molecules on both muscular and vascular plasticity during rodent skeletal muscle remodeling.

The proposed research program aims at advancing our physical understanding of spray combustion phenomenon employed in several engineering power systems, which include air-breathing propulsion systems, diesel engines and liquid-fuelled rocket engines, among others. Two fundamental research projects related to different aspects of spray combustion are proposed, which are: (A) Experimental study of the vaporization and combustion of fuel (liquid) droplet in turbulent flow environments under realistic ambient pressure and temperature conditions, and (B) Experimental study of the break-up of a liquid jet interacting with a cross airflow. Both projects are related in that liquid break-up is the mechanism governing the formation of spray (droplets), whereas the droplet evaporation and combustion happen after the break-up of liquid jet and the formation of droplets. 



Although many features of liquid break and droplet evaporation and combustion in turbulent environment are understood reasonably well, many other features are still less understand. Therefore, more research is still needed to provide the technology foundation required to develop more reliable and practical spray combustion models. The research facility established by the applicant provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of liquid break-up and turbulence effect on droplet evaporation and combustion, which, in turn, will help to build more accurate CFD modeling of spray combustion.

"A fuel cell is an energy conversion device that cleanly and efficiently converts chemical energy (fuel + air) directly into electrical power. In the current era of ever depleting oil and natural gas reserves, concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, and increasing attention to air quality, fuel cells address these issues by offering very high efficiency of operation with less CO2 production, and no emission of pollutants such as particulates, NOx or SOx. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, developed in Canada by Ballard Power Systems, operate by passing pure hydrogen through a porous anode layer and air through a porous cathode. Both electrodes consist of a mixture of ion conducting polymer and small particles of carbon decorated with nanoparticles of platinum (Pt) catalyst. Oxygen reduction, forming water as the

product at the cathode, is the rate (power) limiting process in PEM fuel cells. Our research is aimed at improving the cathode performance, specifically by developing new types of very high surface area carbon support materials (ordered mesoporous carbons, OMC) that allow far better dispersion of the Pt catalyst, thus effectively decreasing the amount of Pt needed to generate the same amount of electricity for a given amount of fuel. Containing pores of uniform size ranging from 5 to 50 nanometers in diameter, the OMCs developed in this work will allow Pt nanoparticles to be better distributed, stabilized and utilized, thus increasing the overall rate of oxygen reduction. To better control their interactions with Pt, polymer phase, oxygen and produced water, the surfaces and pores of the carbon will be chemically modified. These approaches will allow lower

quantities of Pt to be used so that the cost of PEM fuel cells is lowered overall. Another problem in conventional PEM fuel cells is that the carbon powders are susceptible to oxidation under certain operating conditions, thus degrading the performance of the fuel cell over time. By modifying the crystalline nature and surface properties of the OMCs, we will increase the resistance of the carbon supports to this type of corrosion, thus increasing PEM fuel cell durability.","Stockage et transformation de l'�nergie","Ressources d'�nergie","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Alberta,Alberta
"The key goal of our research is the design, synthesis, characterization, and application of novel thin film materials on electrode surfaces. These films have many practical applications, including use in clean and efficient batteries and fuel cells, for the protection of metals from wasteful corrosion, as sensors of species in the environment or in our bodies, and more. The thin films which we have investigated in recent years have ranged from one atom to many millions of atoms in thickness, and have included metals, metal oxides, polymers, corrosion inhibitors, redox-active biologically active materials, and supported catalysts. Our primary objective is to knowledgeably control the thickness, porosity, morphology, particle size, chemical composition, oxidation state, and conductivity of these films, so that new and useful devices and applications can be realized. Specifically, we will replace the expensive metals that are currently used to react with oxygen in fuel cells with much lower cost and more efficient materials, also enhancing our understanding of the oxygen reduction reaction, so that fuel cell technology can soon be realized. A key part of this work involves understanding the molecular structure of the site at which oxygen reacts, using powerful techniques such as X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, Electron Microscopy, and sensitive mass measurement techniques. Another important goal is to improve the internal structure of porous surface films, which currently consist of many small particles and pores of uncontrolled size and distribution, resulting in inefficient material use and limited performance. We will therefore develop thin film structures containing organized pores of controlled diameter and length, e.g., using surfactants as templating materials, to better utilize our active materials.  We will also deposit very small metal particles into the holes of a unique honeycomb surface array to study each particles individually, allowing us to determine the right size and distribution of these particles for maximum performance.  We will also further develop a specialized thin film material as a blood glucose sensor for use by individuals with diabetes.","Stockage et transformation de l'�nergie","Ressources d'�nergie","Anal. & Phys.

"Fuel Cells efficiently and cleanly generate electrical power through the electrochemical oxidation of fuels. Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) are high temperature ceramic systems that offer significant advantages over other power sources, including the more well-known low temperature PEM Fuel Cells. SOFCs have ~80% energy conversion efficiencies when both heat and power are used, can operate on a range of existing fuels, and have lower environmental footprints than traditional combustion based power generating systems. Therefore, there is a large, world-wide incipient market demand for SOFCs for power generation to meet residential, institutional, industrial, and remote requirements, and to serve as the key technology platform for distributed power generation using a variety of Canadian fuels. However, current SOFCs do not yet meet many of the current specifications for commercial exploitation largely due to cost and durability issues.

SOFC Canada was established to foster SOFC R&D and commercialization activities in Canada. It encompasses leading scientists and engineers at Canadian universities, government labs, and industry along the full SOFC supply chain. The technical focus is on two highly promising ""made in Canada"" platforms: low temperature, metal-supported, planar technology and high performance microtubular SOFCs. Specific research goals are to reduce the cost of SOFC manufacture, to improve fuel tolerance (using natural gas and diesel), and to substantially increase their lifetimes and ability to sustain cyclical operation. Achievement of these goals will significantly enhance the development of viable commercial products. NSERC Network funding to SOFCC will serve to facilitate this highly collaborative research effort with clear objectives. The synergy of this pan-Canadian group will constitute a force comparable to those active in other countries and generate many highly trained personnel. Technologies developed by the Network will be advanced to the point of commercial deployment over the 5 year life of the NSERC project. Our industrial partners will have the ability to acquire and apply this intellectual property to commercial products based on Canadian technology.

"While we walk or drive through the world, we are constantly paying attention to things we see on the way, for example, buildings, trees, and other landmarks. We need to pay attention to these elements to determine where we are or to find our way back. At the same time, we are also paying attention to other interesting things, mostly people and events. Nobody really understands how our attention to all these elements is controlled, and how it determines our ability to navigate. The goal of this project is to get a better understanding of this problem.



First, I will study attention in spatial navigation in the laboratory, using virtual reality techniques, to determine as precisely as possible where people are attending while the orient themselves in an environment and while they walk through this environment. At a later stage, I will repeat these experiment again, this time with people walking through real environments.



Second, I plan to develop a theory of how we attend to different elements in navigation. We already have a fairly detailed understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in navigation, but we know hardly anything about attention affects these mechanisms.



Third, I plan to study spatial navigation with people who have problems in navigation, for example elderly people and people with Alzheimer's disease. I hope to better understand what they are missing when they get lost, and I hope to develop assistive devices that may make life a bit easier for these people.

"Cracking significantly affects the performance of reinforced concrete structures. While design is typically based on strength requirements to ensure a structure is safe against collapse, the structure still needs to be serviceable under normal use. Inadequate attention to serviceability requirements can lead to structural problems and a shortened life span as evidenced by the continuing deterioration of our nation's aging infrastructure. This project is concerned with post-cracking behaviour of reinforced concrete under long-term service loads, particularly with respect to member stiffness, deflection and crack control. The ability of concrete to carry tension between cracks (this is called tension stiffening) plays a large role in helping to satisfy serviceability requirements. This has become particularly important with the prevalence of using stronger, lighter and more flexible materials such as fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) in construction.



The current investigation is focused on development of reliable and rational methods for serviceability design that can be easily implemented into our existing design standards and codes. Experimental testing will be carried out to evaluate long term behaviour related to deflection and control of cracking for concrete structures reinforced with either steel or FRP reinforcement. The benefits of adding short discrete fibres to the concrete (fibre reinforced concrete) is also being evaluated.

"The proposed research program on gas hydrates is continuation of my past research efforts. The proposal concerns primarily with the Thermodynamics and Kinetics of gas hydrate formation and decomposition. Natural gas hydrates are ice-like solid crystalline compounds that belong to a group of inclusion compounds called clathrate. They are formed by low molecular mass natural gas components in the presence of water at elevated pressures and low temperatures.  Hydrates are known to plug or damage natural gas transmission lines and processing equipment. They are also known to exist naturally and are considered a potential hydrocarbon source in the near future.  Gas hydrates can also be applied for separation of gas mixtures. We at the University of Calgary have been studying experimental and theoretical aspects of the thermodynamics and kinetics of gas hydrate formation and decomposition since 1977.  We have developed a very significant knowledge base in these areas.  

Regarding the kinetics, we have formulated intrinsic rate models and mechanisms. The intrinsic rate model requires integration of transport, thermodynamic, kinetic and crystallization theories. In the past we determined the intrinsic rate constant by thermodynamic estimation of nuclei size and using population balance of the particles. Recently, we installed a particle size analyser (PSA), in the high-pressure hydrate reactor, and a Raman spectrometer to examine the occupancy of gas hydrates. In the coming years hydrate formation data will be obtained for binary gas mixtures of carbon dioxide with nitrogen and methane. The results should have very important applications for extracting CO2 from power plant flue gases and for producing natural gas from hydrates found naturally in hydrate reservoirs. 

In addition to the kinetics of hydrate formation we plan to study the thermodynamics of semi-clathrates formed from mixtures of nitrogen and carbon dioxide again with the objective of extracting CO2 from power plant flue gases. In order to study the equilibrium behaviour of the system we plan to use our existing equipment.

"Within the Canadian automotive sector there exists an unwavering need to manufacture high volumes of light weight, complex parts in an economical manner.  Aluminum Powder Metallurgy (PM) is acknowledged as a new means by which this can be realized and now represents a rapidly expanding market in many countries.  Unfortunately, there is effectively no Canadian presence in the commercial application of this technology.  Hence, as opportunistic nations continue to capitalize Canada merely falls further behind.  To help alleviate this deficiency, this proposal strategically unites academics with a leading PM parts manufacturer (GKN Sinter Metals) to conduct research at the forefront of aluminum PM science in Canada.  Collectively, the team will conduct industrial research in St. Thomas, Ontario with the intent to devise hot forging procedures for a series of emerging aluminum PM alloys recently developed commercially at Ecka Granules or collaboratively at Dalhousie University and GKN.   Included are materials designed for exceptionally high strength (Alumix 431D), high strength with enhanced wear resistance (Ecka Alumix 231, Dal/GKN Al-12Si), and sustained strength at elevated temperatures (Dal/GKN Al-15Ni).  All are of proven industrial viability from the perspectives of die compaction and sintering and offer mechanical properties in the porous, as-sintered state that surpass those of conventional press-and-sinter aluminum PM blends in current use.  Hot forging would enable full densification and significant property improvements, yet retain the key advantage of PM - near-net-shape processing.  This innovative knowledge would then be applied in the industrial forging of automotive oil pump gears.  Although gears are strategically targeted, a broad scope of applications is ultimately envisioned for this technology.  Thus, to enhance the likelihood of widespread adaptation the team will also devise a complete database of mechanical properties and a full assessment of the corrosion behaviour inherent in the forged products.  It is hoped that such developments will foster Canadian exploitation of aluminum PM and ultimately position Canada as a legitimate contender in this burgeoning industry.","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Manufacturing",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Nova Scotia","Nouvelle-�cosse"

"The Global Positioning System (GPS) has become the preeminent method of outdoor positioning and navigation. Research has focused on improvement of receiver (and antenna) design and data processing algorithms, which have driven unpredicted application growth and diversity. Most contemporary high-precision algorithm development has focused on applications spanning localized areas (e.g., few tens of kilometres), utilizing costly GPS infrastructure, particularly reference stations, to reduce systematic measurement errors. The fundamental goal of the proposed research program is to improve positioning and navigation algorithms in remote areas, such as regions of low population density and the coastal offshore that cannot financially or physically support such investments, addressing the question of how to perform centimetre-level positioning hundreds of kilometres from a reference station. Further incentive for this research is coming from GPS constellation upgrades and the development of similar global and regional systems. This Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) ""evolution"" will greatly increase the measurement strength of positioning algorithms and allow for substantial algorithm development. I propose to build on my previous and current novel research in two forms of positioning and navigation algorithms: long-range Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) and Precise Point Positioning (PPP). There are four themes to the proposed research plan: 1) improving long range RTK by utilizing contemporary empirical and physics-based atmospheric refraction models, 2) improving PPP positioning capabilities (accuracy, filter convergence period and integrity) by enhancing algorithms and introducing external noise mitigation data sources, 3) combining RTK and PPP to improve positioning performance and reduce costs, and 4) predicting how GNSS evolution will affect these developed solutions and our remote location positioning abilities. Research results will be used to increase productivity and improve safety-of-life applications across numerous economic sectors, and advance scientific applications, via the dissemination of algorithms and methods through publications, technology transfers and commercialization.","Technologie des t�l�communications (satellites, radar,etc.)","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Civil Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

   In this research we will first synthesize polymers that exhibit solid electrolyte properties when complexed with lithium salts. These polymers could potentially be used as solid electrolytes in solid state lithium or lithium ion batteries. However, a major drawback of these materials is that they tend to flow under pressure when assembled in cells. As a means of increasing the mechanical properties of these polymers we plan to sandwich them in between the layers of molybdenum diselenide, tin disulfide and titanium disulfide. The synthetic methodology would first and foremost, involve insertion of lithium ions into the layered systems, followed by exfoliation in a solvent. Addition of solutions of the polymers to the exfoliated layers would lead to intercalated materials that could potentially be used in battery applications.  

   We also plan to prepare hybrid materials consisting of nylon-6 and graphite. We believe that these hybrids could possess high mechanical strength that could have various industrial applications such as in the construction of automobile parts. The process  in developing these materials would first involve oxidizing commercially available graphite. This results in graphite oxide, a layered structure that swells readily in water or alcohols. We plan to use trifluoroethanol to disperse the graphite oxide since it can also be used to solubilize the nylon-6. The reaction mixture will be refluxed in air followed by addition of hydrazine in order to convert the graphite oxide to graphite. The resulting hybrids will be cast as thin films, and will be characterized by various techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction, dynamic mechanical analysis and electrical conductivity measurements.

"Current research in areas such as visual science, neuroscience and materials science constantly demands development of novel minimally invasive imaging techniques that can be used as research tools for probing the structure and optical properties of both biological tissue and novel materials. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-contact imaging method that combines micrometer-scale resolution with millimeter-range imaging depth. Furthermore, OCT is capable of extracting functional information (spectroscopic data, blood flow, birefringence, etc.) that can be related to tissue physiology and biochemistry, or specific properties of new materials. The current research proposal has a three long term goals:

-    )	To improve the technical characteristics of OCT, for example, image quality (spatial and temporal resolution, contrast, presence of speckle noise), complexity of the system and software design, through use of most recent technological and scientific advancements. 

-    )	To develop OCT technology that can provide complete description of the morphology and physiological state of the imaged biological tissue sample - this includes 3D structural images of the object, overlayed with areas of abnormal physiological function, blood flow, or concentration of specific biological chromophores such as blood sugar, oxygenation, melanin, etc.

-    )	To develop applications of functional OCT in visual science and neuroscience. 

These goals will be achieved by optimizing the performance of the OCT systems available in my lab, conducting studies in tissue samples, cell cultures and animal models and developing computational models of light interaction with biological cells. The outcome of this research will set the basis for future development of clinically relevant OCT prototypes for early diagnostics of various diseases. Functional OCT can be used as a new imaging technique in developmental neuroscience and in the future, implemented as a tool in neurosurgery for better localization of areas with anomalous brain function, resulting from trauma or disease.

"This funding will be used to upgrade a unique instrument which is able to characterize electrochemical interfaces using in-situ fluorescence imaging. Our current technology is 10 years old.  The main upgrade is to replace a digital camera with a significantly more sensitive camera capable of real time imaging of low fluorescence signals.  Our current setup requires an exposure time of 10 sec to achieve a minimal signal to noise from our modified gold electrodes.  This time is much too long for any useful kinetic or dynamic measurements to be made.  In addition, these long exposure times increase the background significantly and limits our ability to see any changes in the interface due to changes in the electrical variable.  The digital camera requested is 10-100 x more sensitive which allows for faster image acquisition or measurement of smaller changes in the fluorescence during potential perturbation. We have demonstrated the utility of our unique approach to studying these basic building blocks for biosensor surfaces, but further studies need significantly enhanced detection sensitivity. Three graduate students are dependent on this upgrade as are two burgeoning collaborations with European colleagues wanting to learn and duplicate our approach.

"Fuel cells and the hydrogen energy pathway can lead to significant societal benefits, improving the quality of life, health and the environment. Fuel cells are already being used in a number of early market applications (e.g., materials handling, uninterrupted power supply, residential co-generation, personal device applications, etc) with many other applications at the advanced demonstration stage. Improvements in PEM fuel cell performance will require new design concepts for creation of an efficient catalyst layer.  This project is focused on the manufacturing of thin metal catalyst layers on polymer electrolyte membranes using an electroless plating method in conjunction with different templating techniques. The main benefit of this project is the development of a cost effective method to fabricate highly active catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs) for PEM fuel cells. Cost reduction is one crucial aspect of PEM fuel cell manufacturing in addition to the creation of a highly active CCM.  This project proposes a simple approach towards the creation of low loading highly active catalyst layer that will result in improved batch to batch reproducibility also providing an entrance point for the development of high volume manufacturing procedures.

     Beneficial insects and other arthropods are of great ecological importance because they provide a form of natural pest control, a dynamic process that is responsible for the regulation of pest arthropod populations in nature. Microsporidia (spore-forming protozoan pathogens) infect a wide range of beneficial arthropods, including predaceous lady beetles that are often used for aphid control in agroecosystems. Microsporidia are known to cause chronic, debilitating disease that reduces host fitness; therefore, these pathogens may adversely affect the viability of beneficial arthropods in agroecosystems and in nature.

     The discovery of microsporidia in lady beetles used for biological pest control raises concerns regarding the use of some beetles for aphid control in agriculture. It also provides an opportunity to examine these pathogens in more detail, particularly host-pathogen specificity and the effects that these pathogens have on non-target lady beetles and other predatory arthropods. It also presents an opportunity to examine the factors that promote protozoan disease outbreaks (epizootics) among arthropod populations.

     Information gained during this study will help contribute toward our current understanding of protozoan disease epizootics and the role that chronic disease plays in the regulation of arthropod populations. The examination of chronic disease in beneficial arthropods used for biological pest control also benefits the agriculture and horticulture industries by helping to ensure that beneficial arthropods remain a viable alternative to chemical pest control.

"Management responses to mountain pine beetle (MPB)-affected lodgepole pine stands vary from complete removal of the pine canopy and secondary structure (saplings, seedlings, shrubs and herbaceous plants) to selective removal of MPB-affected trees with varying degrees of secondary structure retention, to completely non-invasive strategies, i.e., allowing secondary structure to grow undisturbed in a dead stand. The appropriate management response must balance the potential future economic viability of components of the secondary structure with the need to preserve habitat, ecosystem biodiversity and to minimize disturbance to the carbon and water balances of the stand and surrounding ecosystems. The current bias towards clearcut harvesting in mixed-species stands in the BC Interior reflects the realities of market demand for certain types of wood and paper products. However, the presence of significant secondary structure in many of the affected pine stands could provide opportunities for mid-term (15-30 years) timber harvest, provide habitat for wildlife and reduce run-off to rivers and streams if preserved during salvage-logging operations. By studying changes to stand-level biomass accumulation, evapotranspiration, and microclimate of the residual forest ecosystems in salvage-logged and non-salvage-logged stands, we will determine the relative health and resiliency of MPB-affected forest ecosystems, with the aim of recommending the best management response or combination of responses to the MPB outbreak. The use of remote sensing instruments and vegetation models calibrated against field measurements of ecosystem photosynthesis and decomposition will allow the results of the study to be scaled from stand level to the landscape.","Foresterie (sylviculture, am�nagement forestier)","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"Northern temperate and boreal forests are large reservoirs of biomass and soil carbon (C), and make a major contribution to gross global photosynthesis. It is important to better understand the response of these C pools to climate change, to study the impact of increased disturbance in recent years, and to develop management practices that will enhance their C sink strength. This research will be conducted in boreal, sub-boreal and West Coast temperate forest stands. Our objectives are to (1) study the impact of climatic variability on net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (P) and ecosystem respiration (R), (2) quantify the effects of environmental factors, phenology and P on R and soil respiration (Rs), (3) partition Rs between its heterotrophic and rhizospheric components, (4) assess the effect of nitrogen fertilization on the C balance and N2O emissions in different-aged West Coast Douglas-fir stands, and (5) determine the impact of mountain pine beetle (MPB) attack on the C and water balances of mature sub-boreal lodgepole pine stands.

   We will measure above-canopy CO2, water vapour and sensible heat fluxes using the eddy covariance (EC) approach. In addition to using conventional methods to partition NEP between P and R, we will use EC and chamber measurements of 13CO2 isotope fluxes with tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. Heterotrophic respiration will be measured using a modified trenched-plot root-exclusion technique and used to estimate net primary productivity. Soil N2O emissions will be measured using syringe sampling of static chambers. Temporal effects of MPB attack will be inferred from annual NEP measurements in two lodgepole pine stands at early and late stages of attack.

   This research will improve our understanding of the role of forests in the global climate system and C balance. Quantification of the effects of fertilization and MPB attack will help develop a strategy for Canada to increase C sequestration in its forests. This work will provide valuable data to validate C cycling models and sound training of two M.Sc. and three Ph.D. students, three postdoctoral fellows and four technicians.

"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) particularly affect the upper limbs, are very costly to treat and are associated with long recovery times which can prevent timely return to work.  These painful conditions develop over a long period of time with fatigue, discomfort and stress as leading indicators although all of posture, repetition, force and psychosocial factors are recognised to contribute.  Motion recording and analysis allow both quantitative and qualitative determination of known MSD risk factors during Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).  Skin-mounted markers with multi-camera 3-dimensional motion analysis systems like VICON MCAMTM are be coupled with specially created computer programs to model the upper limbs' postural and repetition risks.  In this work, potential energy of the upper arms reflects postural risks, while elbow, forearm and hand postures will be further quantified over time relative to high-risk extreme postures.  Qualitative motion descriptions will be used to reveal repetitive patterns associated with MSD risks.  Force factors must be captured with external sensors which must be co-ordinated with postural and repetition factors, as well as perceived stressors.  This work proposes to combine these factors first in a laboratory setting and subsequently in work environments with a wearable data capture technology to study working-aged adults' common work-related ADLs.  This will be used to define a practical quantitative measurement tool to describe MSD risk.  This tool will be applied to create a database allowing comparison across populations with no known upper limb disability and those with challenges, including unilateral amputation and prosthesis use, discomfort or mobility limitations.  This multi-faceted tool and data collection will assist Industrial Engineers understand ergonomic MSD risks associated real work methods.","Sant� publique (y compris recherche psychologique li�e � la m�decine)","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Industrial Engineering",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","New Brunswick",Nouveau-Brunswick

"Our group is studying and developing atmospheric pressure ionization (API) sources for interfacing liquid chromatography (LC) with mass spectrometry (MS). In an effort to expand the range of compounds amenable to LC-MS, as well as to improve the sensitivity of LC-MS methods in general, a new ionization method, atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI), has been recently developed. One of our ongoing research projects is aimed at elucidating the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the performance of the APPI source, to place APPI on a firm theoretical foundation through a systematic study of the photophysics and gas-phase chemistry in the ionization region. Future research projects will be undertaken to investigate improvements to the APPI source, as well as to develop novel API source enhancements.

    Raman spectroscopy can be used to determine structural and environmental information concerning biomolecules, at relatively low concentration in aqueous solutions, which makes it a very powerful bioanalytical and biophysical technique. Ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy (UVRRS) is being used for the study of the structure and properties of proteins, peptides, and DNA, and for the in-vivo detection and characterization of biomolecules.  The group will expand its arsenal of techniques for the study and characterization of biomolecular systems to include fs-coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy for structure and dynamics measurements.

    In order to quantify the importance of atmospheric aerosols, we are developing an advanced single particle aerosol mass spectrometer that improves on current designs by combining thermal laser desorption and near threshold photoionization with ion trap mass spectrometry.

This type of information is critical for understanding the role of aerosols in the atmosphere.

"Quantum mechanics is extremely successful at explaining how nature works. It is also the basis of technologies that has revolutionized how information is processed and stored: the laser and the transistor. Despite all of its success, quantum theory is often regarded as strange and counterintuitive. This is because many of its predictions are foreign to our daily experience. However, over the last 20 years it was recognized that some of these strange effects could be harnessed to create computers that would be exponentially faster than current ones. For some tasks, these quantum computers could take a few days or weeks to solve problems that would take todays fastest computers billions of years to complete.



Amongst the most promising approaches to realizing quantum information processors are those based on mesoscopic electrical circuit comprising superconducting tunnel junctions. This research program aims at deepening our understanding of these mesoscopic devices exhibiting quantum phenomena on large length scales and to apply this new understanding to quantum information processing. Understanding the complex dynamics of these systems is however a difficult task and, until we have access to quantum computers, requires the help of some of Canada's most powerful computers.

"Our lab is interested in defining the transcriptional regulatory events that control mammalian skeletal muscle development. We aim at providing a systems view of the whole process, 1) by identifying the protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions that take place during myogenesis, 2) by characterizing in molecular details how specific transcription factors (TFs) regulate the expression of their target genes, and 3) by modeling this information into a regulatory network, which may be queried to infer its organizing principles and used to study other regulatory systems. With this research project, we seek to better understand the function of two TFs in regulating the expression of their target genes, with a focus on their combinatorial behavior. We suggest here to use a multifaceted approach, combining functional genomics, proteomics, molecular biology and biochemistry, to characterize the interplay between the Six1 and Myog TFs, and to determine the exact mechanisms underlying their combined action in the regulation of target gene expression.

"Large quantities of wood treated with waterborne wood preservatives are removed from service each year, and the amounts removed are expected to increase to about 1.5 million cubic meters per year over the next decade. At present, most of this material is treated with chromated copper arsenate (CCA) and it is disposed of in landfills. Over the next few decades, in-service residential CCA treated wood will be replaced by alternative preservative treatments: alkaline copper quat (ACQ), copper azole (CA) and potentially micronized copper systems (MiCu). Wood treated with these preservatives will enter the waste stream in increasing amounts. Considering the high cost of landfill disposal, the potential for leaching of preservative chemicals from the disposal sites and the loss of potentially useful materials to landfills, there is interest in developing technologies to recycle this material. The proposed research investigates the recycling of out-of-service treated wood by cost-effective extraction of the treatment chemicals for reuse by the wood treating industry as well as the potential of re-using the remediated wood for other applications. The extraction of CCA, ACQ, CA and MiCu preservative components from treated wood will be optimized using effective extractants such as strong mineral acids, or solvents that render the extracted materials re-useable as treating solutions. The chemical extraction process, which involves penetration of the extracting solution into the wood, dissolving or reaction of the preservative component, and diffusion of the dissolved component out of wood, will be modeled by diffusion with reaction equations to allow the prediction of optimized particle size and solution and process variables for efficient extraction of wood. The extractions will modify the wood fibre to some extent, and the effects of these chemical changes on the potential re-use of the wood for composting, production of construction materials or energy and other applications will be evaluated.","D�chets, gestion des d�chets et recyclage","Services commerciaux","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Permafrost refers to ground that remains frozen for two or more consecutive years, and it presently covers about 22% of the land surface in the Northern Hemisphere. Canada occupies about one third of this area covered by permafrost. With projected global warming, climate modelers predict that, by 2100, the land area covered by permafrost will shrink by 8-9 million km2 in the Northern Hemisphere, an area roughly the size of Australia. Thawing permafrost will therefore take place on a continental scale, and it will affect our landscapes, ecosystems, and freshwater resources. Despite the extent and speed of these changes, very little is known about how thawing permafrost will affect global geochemical cycles and our freshwater resources. We propose to assess the impact of thawing permafrost on freshwaters on the Mackenzie Delta in Nunavut, and in Old Crow Flats in the Yukon. We will identify lakes affected by recent permafrost thaw slumps with aerial photographs, and we will compare lakes receiving large discharges from thawing permafrost with lakes where permafrost degradation is less apparent. We will compare water quality variables in these lakes (organic contaminants, metals, nutrients) to determine the extent that melting permafrost affects water quality. We will use this information to develop methods to track permafrost degradation in lakes. By extracting lake sediment cores, we will apply these tools to reconstruct the history of permafrost degradation in lakes, and determine if chemical releases by permafrost thawing diminish over time. Finally, we will determine if contaminants released by degrading permafrost are accumulating in freshwater food webs that constitute an important part of traditional diet and lifestyle. This study will constitute the first systematic assessment of thawing permafrost on contaminants in northern lakes and their ecosystems.

"For the past twelve years, I have been studying pathways that concentrate environmental pollutants resulting in significant risks to ecosystem and human health. Most recently, I have been working with colleagues to develop the concept of contaminant biovector transport, which involves the collection, movement, and focusing of contaminants by migratory species like salmon and seabirds. Certain contaminants become concentrated into food webs, and build up to very high concentrations in top carnivores, like salmon. At the end of their lifecycle, these fish swim to their natal streams to spawn and die, funneling their huge numbers into relatively confined environments. The final stage involves the efficient transfer of contaminants into residents of the receptor food web. We call this form of contaminant transfer the biovector pathway, and it has been shown to concentrate chemicals to potentially harmful concentrations in receptor food webs. In recent articles published in Nature and Science, we documented how migrating Pacific salmon and seabirds can concentrate contaminants via similar pathways.  I am proposing to build on this biovector concept by studying the process at a finer resolution to improve our ability to predict areas at risk by contaminants. We will study regions where Coho and Chinook salmon runs in Lake Ontario are active, and we will evaluate their impact on contaminants by comparing contaminant distributions before and after salmon return to spawn. We will identify tracers that allow us to better assess contaminant transfer from biovectors, and we will construct a model that may be applied at broader scales and in other regions. In the process, I will train students to develop skills in critical thinking, environmental modeling, food web dynamics, and ecotoxicology. This research will benefit Canada by improving our ability to identify areas at risk by toxic chemicals. When we evaluate the risks of pollutants, we must consider especially those situations that pose the greatest risk to the environment. The proposed research is important because it seeks to understand how, under specific circumstances, contaminants can build up to very high concentrations that are capable of causing harmful effects.

"The Laboratory for the Analysis of Natural and Synthetic Environmental Toxicants (LANSET) is a research and training facility with a highly specialized and advanced analytical capacity for measuring synthetic pollutants and natural products in environmental samples. In this age of specialization, the services offered by LANSET are not duplicated anywhere else in Canada. There are no Canadian contract or university laboratories available for the range of validated analytical services offered by LANSET for botanicals, and it also offers one of the largest selections of synthetic chemical analytes available to university researchers in Canada.   

The facility is used by a wide range of university, government, and industrial researchers across Canada and the US to examine the transport and fate of environmental pollutants, chemicals that cause estrogenic (feminization) effects in animals, persistent organic pollutants, and organic forms of mercury that concentrate in food chains, as well as a suite of other contaminants. The occurrence of natural toxins in plants and fungi that are analyzed by LANSET can lead to negative effects such as contamination of foods, or benefits such as insect resistance and application as drugs. Major areas of active research include the study of global contaminant cycles, local contamination problems, the characterization and development of plant-derived drugs, and the standardization of medical plants for their natural active components. 

This application under the Major Resources Support program will partially fund LANSET's maintenance and operation by contributing to technicians' salaries who maintain quality assurance and quality control of our data, and maintain expensive and sophisticated analytical equipment, where the continuity in highly trained and dedicated personnel is a requirement for the success and safety of the laboratory.

"Canadians spend more than $142 billion on health care (CIHI, 2005).  Despite spending a record 10.4% of GDP in 2005 on health care, demand for services is increasing.  Ensuring timely access to care at all levels of acute care is a pressing concern and has been the subject of much debate recently, particularly with respect to access to elective procedures.



Hospitals and health care processes are usually thought of as a network of queues with mulitple types of customers and complicated priority schemes.  Simulation, accordingly, is an ideal tool for modelling and analyzing patient flows.



The application of simulation to particular instances of patient flow is well studied and documented in the literature (see Jun, Jacobson and Swisher, 1999 or Preater, 2002 for excellent reviews).  However, one of the more interesting aspects of the operational research literature on patient flow is the number of ""one-off"" studies that appear in the literature.  The overhead in terms of time, effort, and expense have limited the penetration of simulation methodologies into the health care arena, despite their obvious benefits. 



We propose the development of a tool to evaluate wait time issues at the local, regional, and provincial level.  We hypothesize that, despite variations in the organization of care delivery, a common framework can be developed to describe patient flow instances.  Once identified, the framework can be used to develop functional specifications for composable simulation elements that can be used to model patient flow processes.  Ultimately, we believe that it is possible to create a simulation-based environment for decision making that can be used by non-experts to make informed patient flow process decisions.

"The relationships between structure and function in animals can effectively be addressed from the standpoints of both biology and physics. This integration forms the basis of the science of biomechanics. The mechanics of fish swimming (how a fish interacts with the water to produce propulsive forces), energetics (the associated energy) and efficiency (how much energy is wasted) are well understood for fish that swim by undulating their body. This has allowed for an understanding of perfomance in relation to form and muscle powering. For example, the endurance of migrating salmon, the high sustained swimming speed of tuna and the rapid acceleration of pike as they catch their prey. However, less is known about the mechanics and energetics of fish that have a rigid body carapace and swim by undulatory motions of their fins (e.g. trunkfish, boxfish and pufferfish). My previous studies have identified a variety of adaptations that allow these forms to move efficiently at relatively low speed through complex and cluttered environments such as coral reefs. This study focuses on a number of energetically advantageous mechanical interactions between the fish's propulsive fins and its body. Theory suggests that an undulating sheet-like fin attached to a rigid body produces more thrust than the same fin executing the same motions ""on its own"". The purpose of this study is to experimentally confirm this effect and assess its magnitude and energetic consequences in a variety of ""non-bodied swimmers"". Recently, engineers have turned to biology for solutions to practical problems (bioinspiration) and boxfish and their relatives are good models for certain autonomous underwater vehicles that may be used in environmental monitoring (e.g. detecting pollutant concentrations and sources, military applications, ocean surveying) and this work will likely contribute to the design and operation of such vehicles. In particular, undulatory fins offer high efficiency and manoeuvrability. Energy savings through positive hydrodynamic interactions between the propulsor and body being propelled may protract vehicle battery life and thereby mission duration.

"Understanding how emotion affects the way people think is a central question in psychology and the neurosciences. One important aspect of this question relates to whether emotion improves or hinders normatively correct thinking. Many studies have shown that emotion impairs logical thinking in deductive reasoning tasks. Most of that research has been performed in the laboratory, experimentally manipulating affective states. However, recent studies with participants reasoning about meaningful personally experienced events (e.g. war veterans reasoning about combat-related contents) show improved logicality as a result of emotion. This programme of research will attempt to resolve this apparent paradox. Our hypothesis is that when emotional arousal is relevant, related to the contents of what people reason about, it improves logicality in reasoning. By contrast, when arousal is task-irrelevant, induced by something other than the reasoning contents, it hinders logicality.



We will examine this in a series of experiments where participants will be asked to solve different logic problems. These problems will have emotional or neutral contents. The emotions will sometimes be induced by the reasoning problems themselves, which will have emotional contents, or be induced incidentally. We will measure participants' physiological arousal to the stimuli and during the reasoning problems to examine how it is linked with logicality in reasoning. Emotion-related physiological arousal will be assessed with measures such as skin conductance and cardiovascular measures such as heart rate, and heart rate variability. In addition, we will meausre subjective affective states and facial expressions of emotion using electromyography.



With this project, we hope to improve our understanding of the interaction between abstract mental processes and bodily arousal.

Brain rhythms such as theta band oscillation and synchrony appear to represent a basic mode of 

operation of large neural networks, allowing for the selective processing of information related to 

perceptual and behavioral states. Theta (EEG) band oscillation and synchrony is a sinusoidal-like 

waveform with a narrow band frequency range of 3-12 Hz. The guiding hypothesis behind my 

research is that the hippocampus and related structures play a major role in sensorimotor 

integration, formally proposed as the hippocampal sensorimotor integration theory. This theory 

proposes that, just as various regions of the neocortex monitor our sensory world so that we can 

be aware of its elements, e.g., olfaction, vision, audition, the hippocampus monitors our ongoing 

movement. That is, when the motor system directs an animal to walk, run, or stand still, the 

hippocampus monitors that activity and informs the rest of brain of the animal's ongoing 

behavior. In order to support the sensorimotor integration theory, I have described the relation 

between the EEG and ongoing behavior of animals, described the parts of the brain that 

contribute to changes in the patterns of EEG, and described the cellular processes underlying 

them. Understanding how synchronous activity in the hippocampus helps us guide and monitor 

our movements will ultimately contribute to our understanding and treatment of pathologies such Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsies.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

We will perform a detailed analysis of the identified candidate genes. These studies will help us to gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in uterine cell function.

"Almost daily global news reports some area of the planet that is experiencing or recovering from extreme weather conditions.  In many cases these extreme weather conditions lead to or contribute to some form of natural disaster.  Canada has experienced its share of natural disasters in recent years such as the Red River Flood of 1997 and the 1996 Saguenay Flood in Quebec.  During these extreme events flood protection systems acted to minimize impacts of the events and transportation systems were essential for operations to protect our communities through deployment of resources and evacuation of citizens.



Many argue that the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events is increasing.  Global warming and climate change have often been identified as possible causes to the increase in extreme weather events.  Though there is considerable disagreement regarding the origin of these changes, there is growing agreement that climate change is occurring in some form and needs to be considered by engineers in design to ensure our flood protection and transportation infrastructure are prepared for future conditions.



This proposal will develop tools to measure moisture movements at two sites in Manitoba caused by the local weather conditions.  A numerical model will be developed and calibrated based on the measurements from the two sites.  The numerical model will be used predict the impact of proposed climate change models on flood protection and transportation soil slope infrastructure.  Using the results of the predictions, a decision support tool will be developed to help planners and government agencies develop policies to upgrade flood protection and transportation infrastructure based on accepted risk levels during extreme weather events.  This will help ensure optimal spending of public funds to prepare our flood protection and transportation infrastructure for potential future changes in environmental design conditions.

"    )	Many aspects of a cell's behaviour are determined by factors in its immediate surroundings, a 'sphere of influence' that is referred to as the microenvironment. These specific influences may be signals provided by specialized proteins on the surfaces of adjacent cells, spatial information provided by the structural framework of the tissue (known as the extracellular matrix), or other molecules that diffuse freely in the extracellular fluid that normally bathes all cells (except at the outermost surfaces of the organism).

    )	These last-mentioned, 'soluble factors' include a variety of specialized signalling molecules of different chemical types, which have arisen during evolution to coordinate the interactions between the different cells that make up an advanced, multicellular organism. However, the behaviour of cells is also affected by a range of more mundane chemicals (metabolites) that are produced as byproducts of the biochemical pathways which give the cell its energy or yield the materials it needs to survive.

    )	In our previous research within this program we have identified novel mechanisms that alter cell behaviour in situations where cells become starved of nutrients and oxygen. These are likely primitive responses that have been retained and further developed as organisms have evolved to modern mammals. In present-day humans and other animals they help to preserve cellular function in circumstances of cellular stress, although these mechanisms have also been subverted in disease and are one way in which cancer cells gain an advantage.

    )	In the current research we will examine the interdependent regulation of two proteins, designated CD26 and CXCR4, in response to these pathways. These protein partners work to control cell movement and fate under these conditions of stress. We will also examine additional likely players in this scenario, both other metabolites and a key protein that is known to sense energy imbalances. Our objective, as well as to increase our understanding and to train students in this research area, is to identify additional nodes in this regulatory network that might be targeted for scientific or therapeutic benefit.

"One of the main functions of the brain is to generate behaviour, e.g. a movement to interact with our environment. Therefore, it is not surprising that a central question in neuroscience is how vision is used to produce movements. This process of converting vision into movement is called the visuomotor transformation. 



The visuomotor transformation has been extensively studied for static conditions (where objects remain immobile in the environment and we also remain stationary). Here, I propose to study the visuomotor transformation during dynamic conditions, i.e. for movements toward moving objects and also during self-motion. This has not been studied before because static and dynamic signals are processed in different areas in the brain and therefore, it is important to investigate whether dynamic signals undergo a visuomotor transformation as well. 



To answer this question, I plan to first develop a complete mathematical description of the dynamic visuomotor transformation for eye movements. Next, I will test model predictions in behavioural (do we move our eyes the way the model predicts?) and perceptual (do we perceive an object the way the model predicts we should?) experiments. In a third step, I will use a neural network model (an abstract mathematical analogy of how individual neurons in the brain work together) to make predictions about the neural properties we expect to find in the brain in areas involved in the dynamic visuomotor transformation. Finally, I plan to uncover which brain areas are involved in this process in the human brain using functional brain imaging. Taken together, these four approaches will allow me to construct a first complete framework of where, when and how the brain performs the visuomotor transformation in a dynamic environment. 



This project will enhance Canada's excellence in Neuroscience research by developping a new research direction and by training highly qualified personnel. At a longer horizon, I also anticipate the expected results to contribute to the diagnostics, interpretation and rehabilitation of Canadians suffering from motion-related deficits due to brain damage.

"Documents are widely used in our information-rich society.  The proposed research streamlines the transition between paper documents and electronic documents, contributing flexible and general techniques for converting the information in scanned paper documents into electronic form.   One proposed project develops new methods for representing the decisions that are made by document recognition systems.  An explicit representation of decisions makes it easy to determine the causes of recognition errors, and supports automatic optimization of recognition algorithms.  The second proposed project improves document processing by combining an analysis of document text with an analysis of document figures.  The approach will be tested on a document classification problem: identify which technical documents are relevant for maintaining a biomedical database.  The third proposed project  develops methods of using external data to validate and correct recognition results.  For example, an internet search can be used to verify information recognized from a scanned business card, and to correct incorrectly-recognized digits in a telephone number.



The proposed research will train ten graduate students and five undergraduate students.  These students will learn the theory and application of pattern recognition, including the use of mathematics and statistics.  They will gain experience in software development, technical writing and oral presentation.   Graduates of this program are in demand in both academic programs and in the information technology sector, often finding employment in software development or pattern recognition with firms like IBM.

"The wireless telecommunications sector is critical to the Canadian economy, accounting for 25,000 jobs, over $9.5B in revenue, and a $4.1B investment in infrastructure. This sector also has a key role in slowing climate change, as it can reduce travel and enable remote environmental monitoring. In recent years, wireless subscribers have increased at a compound annual growth rate exceeding 17% to reach 14.9M while revenue has grown at a rate of 14%. Worldwide, the subscriber base has been exploding. This demand is accelerating research and development into new generations of high-rate wireless telecommunication systems that can support both fixed and mobile users, achieve high spectral efficiency, enable new multimedia services, as well as lower infrastructure cost, particularly in areas of low population density. 

 

The proposed research will seek novel solutions to increase both coverage and rate while constraining infrastructure cost, bandwidth and mobile terminal power.  This includes investigating multiple antenna systems that are either co-located or distributed for cooperative relaying and hopping. In most existing cooperative system studies, the arrangement of nodes in a network is assumed known and fixed, which may not be practical. Important studies are needed, including capacity, performance, and implementation issues.



In the shorter term, we investigate (i) the utilization of imprecise/imperfect transmitter knowledge in communication, and (ii) cross-layer wireless network optimization. In the longer-term, we address performance optimization of cooperative networks with multiple source-destination pairs, as well as relay topology selection. These themes will be  pursued, where feasible, within the context of specific applications, e.g., multicasting,  military decision support,  and wireless e-health. Six doctoral students will be trained over the grant period.

"Humans interact with their environment through a variety of motor activities such as talking, walking, balancing and performing volitional movements. These daily activities require the precise control of motoneurons controlling multiple muscles to perform the desired action. Although apparently simple, balance, posture and voluntary movements are produced following complex integration of information coming from descending control signals (such as brain) and signals from peripheral receptors (such as skin or muscle receptors). In addition to this complex integration of information, similar human movements can be performed with a different involvement of different signals. An obvious example of this is the possibility to breathe or balance automatically or take conscious control over these actions.

The current proposal will address these fundamental issues underlying the basis of human movements. The model chosen in this proposal is to compare to the rules of sensorimotor integration in motoneurons innervating neck and lower limb motoneurons. These motoneurons were choosen because they have distinct anatomy and innervation but must act together to maintain the head stable while balancing and controlling certain voluntary movements. We will use intramuscular electromyographic recordings, electro-encephalography and stimuli targetted at specific receptors (electrical vestibular stimuli, vibration to induce muscle stretch reflex and acoustic tone to induce startle response) to characterize the influence of these stimuli on neck and lower limb muscles. The characteristic modifications in the firing frequency of motoneurons induced by each stimulus will be used to identify a unique neural signature. In addition, we will study how task requirements and the availability of sensory informations modulates the integration of inputs controlling motoneuron recruitment and firing. The proposed research program will deepen our understanding of the physiology underlying the control of human neck and lower limb musculature and lead to a better understanding of how we interact with our environment.

"I am seeking funding for a field vehicle. My research focus is in behavioural and physiological ecology. I use snakes, turtles, and lizards as model systems. Since I was hired in 2002, my research group has been involved in field studies on wild reptiles across much of Ontario: Algonquin Provincial Park, St. Lawrence Islands National Park, Long Point Provincial Park, Ojibway Prairie Provincial Reserve, and Queen's University Biological Station. Field vehicles are the most expensive and the most essential equipment to my research program. We use vehicles to carry people and equipment to our field sites as well as to bring back animals to the laboratory for measurement, marking, or the surgical implantation of radio-transmitters. Our previous field vehicle (a 1994 Ford Explorer with over 220 000 km) has reached the end of its useful life and we seek to replace it through this application. My research group is usually composed of 2 PhD students, 3 MSc students, and 3-4 BSc students in any given year. The projects of all these students rely on a field vehicle. Training of these students is impossible without access to a field vehicle.

"Physiology has pervasive effects on most facets of ecology. Recently, it has been argued that the temperature and body size dependence of metabolic rate could explain the latitudinal gradient of increasing biodiversity from the poles to the equator. It was also proposes that the temperature and body size dependence of metabolic rate controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. While this new metabolic theory of ecology has stirred much controversy, it is clear that physiological processes, including metabolic rate, are temperature dependent. The vast majority of animals are ectotherms and, unlike endotherms, have limited capacity for buffering the ubiquitous effects of body temperature on all of their developmental, physiological, and behavioural processes. Thus, since reptiles are ectotherms, variation in their body temperature ultimately has a significant impact on fitness, but this impact remains only partially understood. Ectotherms use behavioural thermoregulation to avoid reduced capacities associated with excessively high or low body temperatures. Reptiles regulate body temperature mainly through behaviour and choice of microclimate. Thus, thermoregulation is tightly linked to habitat selection and to behaviour. Because thermoregulation affects fitness through the temperature dependence of physiological processes, we can establish relationships between behavioural thermoregulation, physiology, and fitness in reptiles. My long-term research objective is to decipher how behaviour and phenotype, modulated by physiological constraints, affect whole-organism performance and, thus, fitness-related life-history traits. I use a functional evolutionary approach and most of my work integrates controlled laboratory experiments with field observations.

     Because reptiles are, proportionally, the most threatened vertebrate group in Canada according to COSEWIC, I am also interested in their conservation. I am interested in the conservation implications of climate change.

"Contamination of groundwater by dissolved metals is an environmental problem of international scale. This research program is focused on assessing the potential for the release of dissolved metals from mine sites and industrial sites, and mitigating releases of these metals that affect the downstream environment. The research program includes three components: detailed site investigations to determine the mechanisms resulting in metal release, transport and attenuation; development of numerical models, incorporating these mechanisms to provide improved predictions of the extent and duration of metal release; and development of new approaches for the remediation of groundwater contaminated by dissolved metals. Detailed site investigations will be conducted at mine sites, where the oxidation of sulfide minerals within mine wastes has the potential to release dissolved metals to groundwater and surface waters. New analytical procedures will be developed to assist in determination of the geochemical and biogeochemical mechanisms resulting in metal release and attenuation. A recently developed numerical model will be modified to include descriptions of those geochemical reactions. Using these models the potential fate of dissolved metals under existing conditions will be predicted. Novel remediation technologies will be developed. The technologies focus on inducing favourable geochemical and biogeochemical reactions within aquifers, or within mine wastes, to prevent the release of dissolved metals to downstream receiving water bodies.

"    )	Although there have been many advances in the last decade in synthesizing nanosized components, the assembly of these components into deterministic and controllable patterns remains a major challenge in the field. Such control is required to produce molecular scale electronic, photonic, and magnetic devices that have well-defined and reproducible properties. Because ""top-down"" manipulation of materials on this length scale is either problematic or impossible, researchers have set out to develop methods by which different components in solution can come together in an ordered fashion. This process, termed self assembly, is very efficient provided the components are properly encoded to do so. 

    )	This proposal focuses on using biomolecules as scaffolds for self assembly, taking advantage of their specificity and versatility. The research program will thus exploit some of the significant achievements in biotechnology made over the last 25 years, in order to direct the functional construction of molecules and nanomaterials. The research to be undertaken, as described in the following, involves the use of specific proteins and peptides to construct (1) new magnetic nanostructures, (2) photocatalysts, and (3) molecular electronics percolation networks.

"This research program investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying associative and non-associative fear memory.  We have recently shown that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is critical to associative fear memory (Blundell et al., 2008).  Using the classical fear conditioning paradigm in which an animal learns to associate a context with an aversive stimulus (in this case, a shock), we showed that a systemic injection of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, during consolidation (following fear training) or reconsolidation (following a reminder of the fearful event) blocked subsequent memory for the aversive event.  While these data suggest that the mTOR pathway mediates associative fear memory, it is unknown if it also mediates stress-induced long lasting fear sensitization (e.g. following exposure to a predator), a non-associative fear memory.  Thus, the primary goal of my proposed program of research is to determine if the mTOR pathway is not only critically involved in associative fear memory, but also stress-induced non-associative fear memory.  This will be a first step in determining whether the molecular mechanisms underlying associative fear memory are similar to those underlying non-associative fear memories.  A better understanding of the factors contributing to fear memories will provide valuable insight into the nature of pathological fear disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder and phobias.  Ultimately this knowledge will aid in the development of novel drugs to treat these disorders.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Newfoundland and Labrador",Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador
"The proposed research focuses on two related programs -- electromagnetic and weak interactions, and relativistic approaches to the nuclear many-body problem. A principle aspect of the first research program is understanding the fundamental properties of nucleons and nuclei through electromagnetic and weak interactions with semileptonic probes. At the nucleon level, calculations of two-photon exchange (TPE) radiative corrections have been instrumental in resolving the discrepancy between measurements of electron-nucleon scattering form factors using Rosenbluth and polarization transfer techniques. A hadronic approach is taken to evaluating the model-dependent TPE amplitudes, including the contribution of nucleon resonances. This has implications for parity-violating electron scattering and other precision measurements (e.g. single spin asymmetries), as well as virtual Compton scattering. One goal is understanding the transition between hadronic approaches at low energies and partonic approaches appropriate at high energies. 

Weak radiative corrections within the standard Model have been undertaken. These corrections include those involving one-quark (conventional one-loop), as well as many-quark effects (e.g. those leading to an intrinsic nucleon anapole moment). Expertise developed in the TPE program above will be used for corresponding processes involving weak interactions. This work is expected to be of significance for a new generation of experiments such as the Q_weak measurement of the weak charge of the proton, and parity violating electron scattering.

This ties in strongly with the second research program, which builds on an established program of relativistic approaches to nuclear many-body problems. Recent approaches emphasize the use of effective field theory and density functional methods. Applications will be to nuclear structure, electromagnetic properties of nuclei, and parity violating effects in nuclei.

"By the time that the Earth was just a billion years old (3.5 billion years ago), there is indication that biological processes were already well established.  Within a few hundred million years of this mark, individual cells and filaments had appeared, their fossilized remains preserved in Australia and South Africa.  Two billion years ago, many examples of what are thought to be the precursors of modern cyanobacteria were present, as can be seen in microfossil-bearing rock found at locations in Canada and elsewhere.  This research proposal deals with the components, design and mechanical operation of these early life forms, addressing questions such as:

-What were the designs of the earliest life forms that contained a genetic blueprint and sustained a division cycle, however irregular?

-How did these designs evolve in the first billion or so years of the microfossil record and what are the modern progeny of these cell lines?

-What principles govern such early cell cycles - e.g. minimum energy usage, minimum material consumption, or other possibilities?



This interdisciplinary program draws on concepts and techniques from three traditional scientific fields.  Theoretical and computational physics is employed to relate measured fluctuations in cell shape to the underlying cell design and construction.  Geological field work is undertaken because not all microfossil specimens of interest can be found in national paleontology collections.  Most importantly, the modern analogues of these ancient life forms are cultured in the lab and analyzed with the same techniques as are applied to the fossilized cells, both to validate the techniques and to help determine which modes of cell growth appeared at what point in evolution.

Eye movements allow us to change and hold our fixation on objects in the external world. When an object changes in depth, a corresponding change in ocular focus (accommodation) and alignment (vergence) takes place. These oculomotor systems are interconnected by reciprocal cross links allowing an enhanced coordination of these two functions. For example, a change in eye alignment alone in a young person can provide both the necessary change in alignment and a simultaneous change in focus to the same position in space. However, this synchrony requires adjustment when fixation is prolonged for tasks such as reading. Furthermore, if an asymmetry exists between the degree of focus and alignment needed, as in the case of viewing through a prism, then more extensive adaptive processes must result to modify the basic reflexive responses. Populations show sub groups of individuals which have specific patterns of adaptation arising due to the asymmetric nature of their cross link components. These individuals provide a rich substrate upon which to examine the relationship between adaptation and cross link responses. From this research we should gain both a better understanding of our binocular motor system as well as insight into why some oculomotor systems fail to show normal adaptive responses, These patterns of anomalous adaptation often underlie common clinical disorders found in primary eye care. These disorders are accompanied by predictable symptomology and limitations in visual tasks such as reading.  A better understanding of the basic mechanisms and patterns of adaptation will provide a firmer basis in the diagnosis and the treatment of these conditions using ophthalmic and specialized vision training procedures.

"Cellular automata (CA) are fully discrete, spatially distributed dynamical systems which serve as an alternative framework for mathematical descriptions of physical systems to finite element. The proposed resarch program aims to pursue the applicant's present research activities on CA and to extend them to material science, mechanical engineering, fracture mechanics, and non destructive methods. Concretely, the CA models will be usedto evaluate the behavior of heterogeneous materials for both, mechanical tests (fatigue and dwell fatigue) and non destructive methods (ultrasonic inspections). The materials to be used for simulation are near alpha titanium alloys which are known to suffer from significant fatigue life debit when a dwell is applied at the maximum load at low ambiant temperature (cold dwell debit), which considerably limits their application for the design of critical components of jet engines. The CA which has been developed thanks to the applicant's previous discovery grant will be further developed in order to catch up more details of the micromechanics related to the local elasto-plastic behavior of microstructures. More complex creep behavior laws and some plasticity during the loading stages will be introduced. In particular, some crystallographic texture properties will be introduced. On the other hand, the elastic models for CA that are now available will be adapted to investigate and understand the ultrasonic response of these heterogeneous materials. These elastic models will help a the applicant's research team to better understand some specific results that have been obtained on production parts and that are not yet fully understood. These results are also expected to allow the refinement of non destructive methods that are presently being patterned (in collaboration with the NRC - IMI Boucherville). The expected results should be valuable for both the academic mathematical development world and numerous industrial applications (concrete applications and patterns).

"The principal research objective of this program is to conduct fundamental studies of novel fiber-optic sensing devices based on the lab-on-a-fiber (LOF) concept which could be used in safety and security or environmental monitoring as remote detectors of dangerous substances. These devices will be based on photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) and on a variety of functionalized coatings, for applications in photonic sensing of selected chemical targets. The program also includes a major applied thrust in technology development, prototyping, testing and implementation of an advanced universal LOF-based technological platform for fiber-optic sensor systems incorporating the sensing devices to be developed. The research plan includes specific short-term and long-term objectives. As the first objective at the sensing device level, studies and development of a novel generation of fiber-optic sensors based on PCFs will be undertaken to develop an entirely new class of devices with programmable properties. These devices will be specifically designed using a variety of approaches, involving long-period gratings, tandem gratings and task-specific fiber segments, in combination with few-mode and multimode interferometry. A practical objective is to selectively design and optimize the transmission, polarization, and light collection properties of these devices through appropriate microstructural modeling, and then to fabricate them through appropriate technological processes. A second objective is to subsequently equip these devices with a variety of functionalized coatings, in order to induce surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence quenching or other effects allowing for selective detection of a wide variety of intended chemical/biological targets. Consequently, we expect to design and manufacture fiber sensors with superior metrological properties, including selectively enhanced sensitivity to a chosen target, highly decreased sensitivity to temperature and negligible false positive ratio. Due to the flexible properties of the new sensors and the processing functionality/adaptability of our LOI system approach, they will be compatible with many specific sensor configurations.

"Polyketide natural products are a major source of drugs to treat bacterial infections, and cancer.  Developing efficient methods to synthesize these molecules and their analogs is necessary for understanding their mode of action, improving their pharmacological properties, and developing them as drugs.  Polyketides are made by bacteria through modular, assembly line-like enzymatic pathways.  It is possible to rationally reprogram these pathways to make new polyketides.  This approach has the potential to revolutionize drug development and manufacturing, bringing new polyketide drugs to the market more rapidly with lower production costs. 

     The major hurdle in reprogramming these pathways to produce designer polyketides is our limited understanding of how to access the broad structural diversity seen in polyketide natural products.  Study of the enzymes involved in these pathways has characterized how only a subset of this diversity is constructed.  This proposal focuses on developing new methods to increase the chemical diversity accessible from reprogrammed enzymatic pathways and training HQP at the interface of chemistry and biology.

     Two complementary approaches are used to extend the range of functional groups accessible by polyketide biosynthetic pathways.  Enzymatic pathways can be programmed to build molecules containing reactive functional groups that can undergo spontaneous chemistry unmasking hitherto inaccessible chemical diversity. Using this approach, Ph.D, M.Sc. and undergraduate students will synthesize currently inaccessible functional groups in the anticancer agents spiculoic acid A and neopeltolide.  A second approach focuses on engineering existing proteins to access new diversity.  By characterized in detail the molecular interactions between protein and substrate, we will identify and modify amino acids responsible for controlling the regiochemical outcome of the critical ring forming enzymes from these pathways.  HQP in this project will focus on accessing analogs of the antibiotic erythromycin and estrogenic metabolite zearalenone.

Many news items, dealing with security breaches and inappropriate use of private data, have attracted a lot of attention and created pressure on governments to regulate the use of private data.  Governments have responded with enacting privacy laws that regulate the collection and use of private data in various domains, such as HIPPA in the US for health data and PIPEDA in Canada for data collected online.   Most companies today inform users under which privacy policies data is collected and tools have also been created to provide users/customers with automated agents that fetch the web site's privacy policy and compare it the user's privacy preferences.  However there is urgent need to provide appropriate tools for enforcement of privacy policies, that is, to ensure that private data is indeed used that satisfy the privacy policy under which it was collected.

"The general aim of this proposed research is to broaden the basic knowledge we have been developing over the past years in the field of organic synthesis and to exploit this expertise to synthesize and characterize new organic molecules with properties that render them candidates for incorporation in organic electronic devices (e.g. organic light-emitting diodes, field effect transistors) and/or testing for biological activity (e.g. anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory).  

The focal points of this proposal are a specific class of molecules called pyrenophanes and a particular chemical reaction called the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction.  We have developed a very effective method for synthesizing pyrenophanes, which are potentially useful in organic electronic devices because of the rich photochemistry and photophysics associated with the main part of the molecule (a pyrene system).  We propose to synthesize a broad range of new pyrenophanes with new and unusual structures and fully characterize the products wth an eye to potential application in devices. 

The IEDDA reaction is an infrequently used variant of one of the most useful reactions in the field of organic chemistry.  We have developed a class of IEDDA reactions that lead to the formation of certain heterocyclic aromatic compounds (xanthones and benzocoumarins) that are not only subunits of many naturally occurring and biologically active (e.g. anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory) compounds, but also can possess interesting and potentially useful optical properties.  We propose to use our IEDDA chemistry to synthesize and characterize a variety of xanthone and bezocoumarin-based molecules with an eye to potential application in devices as therapeutic agents.

The proposed research is fundamental in nature and deals primarily with synthesis and characterization.  The design and fabrication of organic electronic devices is beyond the scope of this proposal.

"Nerve cells communicate with each other via specialized intercellular junctions known as synapses. The modification of synapses is a key feature underlying plasticity that occurs during development and learning. Widely studied examples of vertebrate plasticity are long-term potentiation (LTP, a persistent synaptic enhancement) and long-term depression (LTD, a persistent synaptic weakening). While short-term events in plasticity are mediated by protein modifications, later events require the synthesis of new proteins at the synapse. The finding that certain messenger RNAs are transported to and translated at the synapse led to the notion that long-term plasticity is implemented by spatially and temporarily restricted protein synthesis. However, the molecular basis of how this occurs remains elusive. MicroRNAs, a recently identified class of nucleic acids, are increasingly recognized as key regulators of protein synthesis. Suggestively, miRNAs in neurons can be detected close to synapses. To further elucidate the role of miRNAs in protein synthesis during synaptic plasticity we want to analyze whether the microRNA content in the dendrite changes after LTP or LTD. Identifying microRNAs that are regulated during plasticity and elucidating the control mechanisms for protein synthesis at the synapse will greatly enhance our knowledge of basic mechanisms underlying neuronal development as well as learning and memory.

"Spermatogenesis, the process by which mature sperm cells are produced in the testis, is one of the most complex processes that occur in the body and is essential for sexual reproduction.  Spermatogenesis consists of a carefully orchestrated series of events beginning with the asymmetrical division of spermatogonia (the germ cell stem cell population), followed by meiosis to produce haploid spermatids, and finally the differentiation of the spermatids into mature spermatozoa, the latter process being commonly referred to as spermiogenesis.  While our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that regulate and coordinate spermatogenesis remains incomplete, it is well established that androgens are critical effectors, and these androgens are produced locally within the testis by Leydig cells.  Far from being a static population, Leydig cells arise and are continuously renewed from a mesenchymal precursor cell type located in the testis interstitium.  Therefore, spermatogenesis and Leydig cell function both depend on the precise regulation of the proliferation and differentiation of two distinct stem/progenitor cell populations.  Our preliminary data, coupled to a handful of recent studies, suggest that a family of signaling molecules called Wnts may play major roles in both cell types, functioning as regulators of both Leydig cell proliferation and spermiogenesis.  In light of this, we propose 1) to identify the specific Wnt pathway components that mediate Wnt signaling in the testis; 2) to study the effects of disrupting or increasing testicular Wnt signaling in a cell-specific manner in vivo; and 3) to identify the downstream transcriptional targets of Wnt signaling in Leydig cells.  Taken together, these studies should unearth previously unsuspected mechanisms of regulation of some very fundamental aspects of testicular physiology, and will further our understanding of male fertility and of stem/progenitor cell biology.

"My research examines evolution at the species and population level. I chose to investigate speciation events in polyploid salamanders and frogs and in all female populations of salamanders. Although these systems are probably unique to amphibians, an understanding these processes can be applied to increase basic understanding with respect to the evolutionary significance of sex, gene regulation, variation in DNA quantity, the interaction of different genomes in the same nucleus, and the importance of these processes to speciation events. Amphibians are a very large and diverse group of vertebrates that have been evolving as a group for more than 200 million years. They exist on all continents but Antarctica and have adaptations that allow them to exist in a wide variety of habitats. Polyploidy has independently evolved several times in amphibians and a variety of reproductive strategies are known. I propose to use molecular biological techniques (genomic and mitochondrial DNA sequences, microsatellite DNA loci, and fluorescent probes) in combination with cytogenetic techniques (in situ hybridization of fluorescent probes - GISH and FISH) to obtain data that will help to understand intergenomic interaction and the evolution of unisexual salamanders and bisexual frog polyploids. The selective advantages or disadvantages of these unique amphibian systems in time and space can be compared with other polyploids and with related, normally reproducing species.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Evolution & Ecology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"A new CCD area detector and camera will be purchased for McGill's existing small molecule X-ray diffractometer.  The new camera is an Apex II from Bruker AXS and it is designed for the D8 diffractometer and Goiniometer which will be retained.  The new APEX II system has considerably improved sensititivity; four fold over the older currently installed system.  In addition a new data management system and software will be installed for collecting and processing this data intensive experiment.  

   This upgrade will considerably enhance the diffractometer's ability to measure crystals with heavy atoms where absorption is a problem.  We find that when conventional sized and thus relatively large cyrstals are used, absorption remains a constant problem requiring extensive data manipulation to generate models to account for this effect.  Also this upgrade will help improve the Flack statistics for absolute configuration determination for chiral compounds.   All three projects the co applicants have identified will benefit from these features and the new system will lead to considerably improved structural determinations for all measurements with this system.

"The nitrogen oxides are an industrially, environmentally, and biomedically important class of compounds.  Nitrogen containing fertilizers such as urea, nitrate, and ammonia rank among the top industrial s chemicals.  It is in their use as fertilizers and as by-products of fuel combustion that they become environmentally important for their roles in photochemical smog and freshwater eutrophication.  Nitric oxide has important roles in human physiology including vasodilation in arteries, immune modulation by white blood cells, and potentiation (long term memory) in the brain.  The connection between all of these roles is the fundamental and surprisingly complicated chemistry of nitrogen's oxides.

Chemical biology research in my group uses new biology and chemistry to translate discoveries in one to the other discipline.  For example, nitric oxide is involved in cell killing by the immune system and our efforts to understand this biochemistry led us to isolate peroxynitrite, ONOO anion, for the first time.  Conversely, our efforts to understand nitric oxides reactions has led us to important hypothesis on how it reacts with C=C and N=C double bonded species.  

In this proposal we continue this translation of discoveries between the disciplines.  In our first line of research we will test our hypothesis by first understanding how nitric oxide interacts with simple molecules with N=N, C=N, and C=C.  These studies will then lead into those involving the formation of trans-fats and we will determine if nitric oxide can catalyze the formation of toxic trans fats of the normal unsaturated membrane lipids with a cis configuration.  In another line of research we will determine the biological fate of nitroxyl, NO anion or HNO, to determine the origin of its vasoactivity which is surprisingly different from neutral nitric oxide.  Finally the chemistry of nitrous oxide and its derivatives will be studied in an effort to find ways to remediate and scrub this greenhouse gas.   This research provides many ways to train highly qualified personnel in modern science as the research involves synthesis and analysis of complex systems.

"Worldwide, bark beetles and their fungal associates are devastating many forest ecosystems. Global warming increases the geographic range of bark beetles and affects the life cycle and survival of beetles and pathogens as well as tree physiological responses to pests. In Canada, outbreaks of mountain pine beetles (MPB) and spruce beetles are prime examples of major forest health risks impacting wood fibre supplies, biodiversity and forestry dependent communities. In British Columbia, MPB typically attacks mature lodgepole pine trees. Recent MPB attacks on different hosts and younger trees threaten new geographic areas, natural forest regeneration and planned reforestation. In this context, realistic assessments of large-scale forest health risks involve characterizing key factors in the dynamics of insect-vectored fungal epidemics, e.g. microbial diversity carried by the beetle, variability in fungal pathogenicity and fungal colonization of new hosts. Because very little information is available for such factors, we propose to a) assess traditional and new indicators of fungal pathogenicity on lodgepole pine using isolates of the most pathogenic fungal associate of MPB, b) determine whether MPB-fungal pathogens can colonize and be pathogenic to non-host trees (e.g. spruce), c) evaluate genetic markers that can differentiate virulent from non-virulent fungal isolates in an epidemic population, d) establish which tree defence mechanisms are activated and inactivated in host trees by virulent and non-virulent fungal pathogens, and e) establish which mechanisms allow fungal pathogens to overcome tree defences. To assess risks that the MPB epidemic could spread to other tree species and geographic regions, it is critical to address these issues and provide tools and information to government and forest products industries. The information will support decision-making in forest stewardship organizations aimed at preventing current and future epidemics from spreading to new regions and preparing for future bark beetle/fungal outbreaks. The active participation of the Canadian Forest Service as a supporting organization will allow for immediate transfer of new knowledge and tools from this project to the enduser.","Foresterie (sylviculture, am�nagement forestier)","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Much of chemistry everywhere involves metal atoms. This research proposal explores the role of metal atoms in their positive singly and multiply-charged ionic state (with one or more) electrons removed in a variety of chemical and biological environments. Measurements will be taken with state-of-the-art instrumentation to characterize and understand the chemical reactivity of isolated atomic metal and non-metal ions with small molecules including many atmospheric gases. The results of these measurements will find application in analytical mass spectrometry as aplied in elemental analysis and geochronology, for example. Other measurements will explore the change in reactivity when singly and doubly-charged atomic metal ions are attached to organic or biological fragments such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and buckyballs.  Metal cations will also be attached to multiply-charged DNA-like anions. Special emphasis will be given to the chemical and ultraviolet cleavage of these DNA-like anions, as well as the chemical repair of such ions, and this will be done in the absence and presence of metal atom ions. The role of metal cations as catalysts will be explored using both experiment and theory in the oxidation of hydrocarbons in the gas phase nd this may find application in catalytic converters as well as advancing our understanding of the fundamentals of catalysis. Metal impurities will be measured in new organic semiconductor molecules in an attempt to ascertain their importance in the performance of these semiconductors.  We shall also look outward to the role of atomic metal cations in the chemistry of planetary atmospheres including our own where metals are deposited by meteor ablation and still further out in interstellar clouds where metal cations are thought to exist both as free atomic ions and bound to small organic molecules or particles. Of particular interest in these latter environments is the metal-catalyzed growth of biological molecules such as amino acids and peptides. Very little is known about the importance of metals in the chemistry of space.

"Chemical reactions can occur on very fast time scales that require specialized equipment to follow. The laser/fluorescence facility at UVic is set-up to measure reactions that occur from nanoseconds to many seconds. The UV-Vis spectrometer is essential as support equipment for laser flash photolysis, fluorescence, single-photon counting and stopped flow experiments. The absorbances of solutions have to be known exactly before any of the experiments listed above are performed. In addition, when high powered excitation sources, such as lasers, are used it is a requirement to check frequently during the experiment for the potential decomposition of the sample. For this reason, the Cary 1 UV-Vis spectrometer is routinely used during all experiments. The Cary 1 is now 17 years old and has been declared obsolete by the manufacturer. This proposal urgently requests funds for a replacement of the Cary 1. The permanent break-down of the Cary 1 would negatively affect the work of 8 research groups that use the laser/fluorescence facility.

"Many chemical processes occur on very fast time-scales, from thousands to millions of times faster than humans can blink their eyes. Probe molecules, which light up when irradiated, are used to follow these fast chemical reactions. The change of the probe's fluorescence intensity with time is detected with a technique called single photon counting (spc). This proposal requests funds to enhance the capability of the spc to enable time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements. Anisotropy experiments will provide information on how fast probes tumble. These experiments are essential for the Bohne group to obtain information on the changes in sizes of supramolecular systems. The Moffit group needs anisotropy measurements to characterize quantum dots. The detection of protein-protein interactions is studied in the Hof group on the protein S100A7, which is a key component of a novel breast cancer signaling pathway. Anisotropy experiments use polarizers as requested in this proposal. However, the polarizers will decrease the light intensity of the non-polarized light of our current excitation source (hydrogen flash lamp). For this reason, high intensity pulsed diode lasers (DLs) and pulsed light emitting diodes (LEDs) are also requested.

"Chemistry is the science based on the studies of how molecules are formed and disassembled, i.e. it is the science that studies processes in which bonds between atoms are formed and broken. Supramolecular systems are formed because of specific interaction between molecules. These supermolecules or self-assembled systems are important because they can perform functions that cannot be achieved by the separate molecules. One key feature of supramolecular systems is their reversibility, which is essential for many of the designed functions, such as transport of small molecules through membranes, catalysis of reactions or sensing of important metabolites or pollutants.

My research program is centered on studying the speed at which different building blocks enter and exit supramolecular systems. We have been able to develop methodology to measure exit/entry processes as fast as 0.1 microseconds (a tenth of a millionth of a second), and have been able to apply these methods to simple host-guest systems. We propose now to expand these studies to systems with more than two building blocks or systems where different places with different properties exist for the binding of a guest. In addition experiments are also proposed to study the binding of small molecules to biopolymers, i.e. DNA and proteins. The underlying question is to understand how an increase in complexity in supramolecular systems affects the dynamics of interaction of the various building blocks in these systems.

"In this research program I will be focussing on two classes of problems that are driven by industry but require the application of innovative mathematics.



I will be concerned with:

(A). The simulation of manufacturing techniques used to produce certain classes of semiconductors.

Semiconductors surround us and for specialized electronic devices, any improvements in their manufacturing technique will have a direct impact on our daily lives. Such specialized materials are very costly to produce so the development of mathematical models and mathematical simulations are very cost effective tools that can be used to advance the state of the art in this industrial sector.  In particular, for this research program, I will attempt to identify optimal growing conditions for semiconductor crystals that evolve with the growing crystal.  The primary crystal under concern is InSb which distinguishes itself from the already extensive crystal growth research in that to produce a crystal free of defects, the crystal must be i) grown with a nontrivial lateral shape and ii) be allowed to produce facets.



(B). Problems from the oil recovery and environmental engineering fields.

I hope to develop methodologies that will increase our understanding of the underlying processes.  Here my research will address the modelling and simulation of processes that include multiple phases (solid, liquid, gas) and more than one material.  I will be particularly concerned with the mechanisms that limit instabilities in steam/bitumen flow in the fluid coking process, and in the environmental field I want to develop multiscale models to help predict the retention and propagation of pollutants within the soil.

"The Y RNAs are small non-coding cellular RNAs that are conserved from worms to man. The functions of Y RNAs remain largely unknown. We have recently shown that close to 1000 sequences derived from the Y RNAs are scattered across the genome of all primates, mostly in gene-coding areas. These Y-derived sequences result from retroposition (transformation into genomic DNA from RNA) using the machinery of endogeneous Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1). The Y RNAs thus represent a novel class of mobile (transposable) elements. We have also observed that small fragments of 21-30 nt in size derived from Y RNAs can be isolated from cultured cells and from apoptotic cells. These observations point towards roles for Y-derived sequences in the regulation of gene expression, in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA, and in the control of retroposition of mobile (transposable) elements. As a consequence, our specific objectives are:

1-    )	Using bioinformatics, to characterize the full repertoire of Y-derived sequences in the genome of primates and to identify among these sequences those that contain potential regulatory sequences at the DNA or RNA level

2-    )	Using an in vivo retroposition model, to define the characteristics that predispose Y sequences to be retroposed through the LINE-1 machinery

3-    )	To characterize the functional consequences of the presence of Y-derived sequences in introns and in 5'UTR regions of human genes

4-    )	To clone and sequence small RNAs (21-23 nt and 26-30 nt) derived from Y RNA sequences, and to study their potential roles as miRNAs (in the post-transcriptional control of mRNA), and as piRNAs (in the control of retroposition of mobile elements)

Clearly, this is an ambitious multifaceted project, and its completion goes beyond the period funded by this grant.

"Technology advances have a tremendous effect on the complexity of chips. To enhance productivity in the fields of design and verification of systems on chips, higher levels of abstraction must be defined. This led to the concepts of  ESL (Electronic System Level) design and verification, an emerging electronic design methodology that focuses on the higher abstraction level concerns first and foremost. ESL is defined as the utilization of appropriate abstractions in order to increase comprehension about a system, and to enhance the probability of a successful implementation of functionality in a cost-effective manner. For instance, the designer productivity can be greatly improved using a transactional level model that abstracts the functionalities of the system being designed. To answer this abstraction issue, researchers have proposed the concept of platform. 

In this context, during last years my research group has worked on Space Codesign, a SystemC high level virtual  platform based on ESL that enables the modeling of hardware/software systems at the transactional level in order to facilitate (micro) architectural exploration and that also supports a refinement process based on FPGA platforms. Space Codesign has completed  a technology transfer program and  is currently in a spinoff phase.

The main objective of this 5 years project is to advance research aspects of the ESL field related to the virtual platform.  We will  focus on the following issues:

1) Development of metrics for energy consumption

2) Development of models of computation for real-time

3) Support of an ASIP library

4) Development of a unique flow for design and verification

5) Improvement of techniques for sequential equivalence checking

"NSERC'S HYDRONET: A NATIONAL RESEARCH NETWORK. TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE HYDROPOWER AND HEALTHY AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS. 

CONTEXT: The 470+ hydroelectric facilities distributed across the country generate 60% of the electricity used by Canadians. The rising demand for energy and the interest in renewable energy will require additional facilities and increased production of existing installations. Hydropower, however, affects water distribution and movement within and among watersheds and the physical, chemical, and biological processes in aquatic ecosystems. While it is desirable that environmental stewardship attributes of hydroelectric facilities parallel their performance at producing electricity, achievement of the former objective is impeded by the difficulties associated with accurately estimating the effects of hydropower on aquatic ecosystems. The Canadian Electricity Association, responsible for delivering reliable and affordable electricity, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada, responsible for protecting fish and their habitats, have agreed by means of a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2002, that sustainable hydropower can only be achieved by the establishment of a cooperative working partnership aimed at better understanding the effects of electricity generation on the environment. The proposed national research network, NSERC's HydroNet, constitutes the realization of such a partnership.



The GENERAL OBJECTIVE of NSERC's HydroNet is to promote sustainable hydropower in Canada via a better understanding of the effects of hydroelectric facilities on aquatic ecosystems. Through coordinated national efforts, NSERC's HydroNet will supply new knowledge about the effects of hydropower on abiotic and biotic processes. Science-based practical solutions will provide govel111nent and industry resource managers with new tools to assess, mitigate, and minimise potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems, and to reduce conflict among stakeholders.

"The male and female gametes are the basis of a new individual and their intact genomes ensure faithful transmission of genetic information to the next generation. The production of the male gamete during spermatogenesis is a complex differentiation process. The haploid phase of this process termed ""spermiogenesis"" is characterized by an important restructuring of the chromatin involving a major change in DNA packaging. We have clearly demonstrated that in both mouse and humans transient DNA strand breaks appear in the whole population of sperm cells  precursors (spermatids) and are coincident with the major steps of chromatin remodeling. Any occurrence of transient strand breakage represents a potential threat to DNA integrity and the mutagenic potential of this important step of chromatin remodeling has been so far overlooked. Perturbations in the process can lead to genetic alterations with dramatic consequences for fertility or genetic disorders of the embryo. During spermiogenesis, the histones, which normally package DNA, are withdrawn following a biochemical modification (acetylation). Acetylation is though to create a transient state of DNA sensitivity allowing strand breakage. We identified a novel enzyme able to acetylate histone and that may play a role in the formation of DNA strand breaks. This enzyme, termed lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase alpha (LPAATalpha), is normally involved in lipid metabolism but is now surprisingly found in the nuclei of spermatids. This project aims to study the new nuclear role of LPAATalpha and other acyltransferases in controlling histone acetylation and the formation of DNA breaks linking for the first time lipid metabolism to chromatin dynamics.

Certains mod�les d'�cologie comportementale, qui ont �t� d�velopp�s et test�s chez les femelles de parasito�des, pourraient s'appliquer, avec quelques ajustements, aux m�les parasito�des. On s'attend � ce que les comportements des m�les soient soumis � une pression �volutive menant � une maximisation du gain de valeur adaptative (fitness) � vie du m�le.

En utilisant les parasito�des des oeufs Anaphes spp (Mymaridae) et Trichogramma spp (Trichogrammatidae), les hypoth�ses suivantes seront test�es.

1- Choix du partenaire sexuel

2- Allocation du temps sur l'agr�gat d'�mergence par les m�les.

3- Production et allocation des spermatozo�des � l'accouplement.

"The Web was initially used to distribute documents for direct human consumption. The Semantic Web is additionally distributing formalised knowledge for machine consumption to assist humans. Formal knowledge extends databases by expressive vocabulary definitions (ontologies) and policy specifications (rule systems). Since machines can interpret such formal knowledge, they can use it to logically prove knowledge that is new to the assisted humans. However, not all formalisations can be processed efficiently on the Web (scalability issue) and not all pairs of formalisations can be translated into each other (interchangeability issue). Challenges for Web-based knowledge interchange arise from syntactic and semantic heterogeneities of ontology and rule languages above the XML-infrastructure level. This proposal explores scalable rule interchange over a network of the size of the Web, which will be enabled by: (1) an agreement on a rule language standard (e.g., a dialect of W3C's Rule Interchange Format) to drastically reduce the number of translators between interchange partners; (2) the efficiency advantage of rule interchange involving rule translation over rule querying; (3) the use of a Mediator Architecture connecting interchange partners in domain-specific subspaces of the Web. With (1)-(3) in place, distributed rule creation, deployment, and maintenance become feasible. This will be evaluated by: (4) use cases in symposium planning, opportunity alerting, and digital rights management. Work on these four components has been converging, in Canada and abroad, toward scalable rule interchange. The proposal takes up this window of opportunity to discover a viable synthesis by systematically researching the component techniques and their interactions.","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computing and Information Sciences - A",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","New Brunswick",Nouveau-Brunswick
"In this project, the applicants are proposing a novel approach that will address several important problems in mining service industries. The approach is based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. RFID technology is a wireless technology that allows for automated data collection and unique identification of objects. In comparison with other data collection technologies such as barcodes, RFID has the following advantages: it does not require line of sight for reading IDs, it performs well in rugged and harsh environments, and it can simultaneously read multiple assets at much higher rate. Applied to the mining service industry, RFID has the potential for inventory management of explosive devices and materials, reducing danger to personnel and machines by finding unfired detonators and boosters, facilitating the placement of explosive material prior to detonation, having more effective security systems, and product ID (using the right components and devices) and track recording. In this sector there is also opportunity for RFID-derived productivity improvements in maintenance and utilization of Mining Services high-cost specialised equipment.

This project will resolve many research challenges related to improving read range through soil, improving the technology for positioning of the buried objects, understanding propagation issues through soil, rocks, ores and many others. 

The industrial partner is very interested in the technology and brings significant experience and knowledge regarding the applications as well as state-of-the-art solutions. The project is of strategic interest to Canada because of the importance of mining service industry and the potential of RFID technology. In addition, results of this project are applicable to any other area where it is necessary to detect and locate buried objects, or ""to see"" tagged objects through media such as concrete.

"With the increasing need for groundwater supplies, there is an urgent need for devising strategies for protecting the precious groundwater resources from contamination. Environmental containment through the use of colloidal silica (CS) based chemical grout is becoming an important step in groundwater protection. CS gels have also been used for geotechnical applications and enhanced oil recovery operations during secondary recovery of petroleum. While there have been some efforts in this vital area, there has not been any concerted effort to understand the processes related to flow and transport of these gelling solutions through porous media. Hence there is an urgent need for a research program to develop our understanding of the processes occurring during chemical grouting through both experimental and numerical investigations in an effort to advance our knowledge towards development of containment technology. The major objective of the research is to understand the mechanisms occurring during chemical grouting into heterogeneous porous media through numerical and experimental studies. The proposed numerical and experimental studies will focus on the effects of density, mathematical coupling of flow and transport, filtration of gel blobs and heterogeneity during the grant period.



As indicated above the chemical grouting technology will be of immense use to the society in terms of groundwater protection through environmental containment and preventing entry of contaminants along with surface runoff. The ultimate objective would be to develop technologies that will safeguard our environment and the health of the people living in our communities.

"Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are nanoparticles that promise to revolutionize many industries. They are composed entirely of carbon, like diamond, but they are manufactured to be tiny tubes with diameters of 1 to 25 nm and with variable lengths. CNT have several exceptional properties, such as mechanical strength, that suggest applications in diverse fields. Whether CNT will be an environmental hazard is unknown but is of concern because no cell or organism evolved with these structures. Methods of evaluating the impact of CNT and their waste on the health of humans and ecosystems need to be developed and is the focus of this proposal. We are proposing to study the interactions between CNT and a group of single cell organisms, the ciliates. Ciliates are classified as protozoa or protista and are found in the waters and soils of the world. They are an important link between bacteria and multicellular organisms in food webs. Ciliates are also of economic importance: they are found in sewage treatment plants, where they function to produce good quality sewage effluent. Ciliates can be considered specialists at dealing with particles because they are constantly engulfing water and bacteria into food vacuoles. CNT can exist as individual nanotubes and as aggregates. From a toxicological point of view, the single nanotubes are likely much more toxic than aggregates. CNT aggregation can be viewed as a detoxifying mechanism, but also as a route for them to move through food chains and into humans. Therefore, we will investigate the aggregation of CNT in soil and water and the role of ciliates in this and whether the incorporation of CNT by ciliates modulates CNT transfer up food webs. Understanding these processes can lead to ways of minimizing the release and environmental impact of CNT, of monitoring CNT in the environment, and of undertaking remediation. A particularly exciting and beneficial spin off of this research could be the development of methods that use ciliates and CNT to monitor chemical contaminants in the environment.

"Fish feed will have to be improved if aquaculture is to be sustained in the future. A major reason for this is the current use in fish feed of fishmeal. Fishmeal is prepared from fish caught for the most part in the open ocean. This resource likely cannot be exploited any further than the current pace of harvesting because fish populations in the ocean appear to be generally in decline. As a result, the expansion of aquaculture is limited despite its importance to the economy and health of Canadians. One way of overcoming this limit on feed is to replace fishmeal with plant-based material.  Among plants, soybeans is considered to be a good economic choice. However, in the case of one of the most important aquaculture species in Canada, the Atlantic salmon, soybean-based diets are detrimental. They cause inflammation of the fish intestine, impeding growth and production. Efforts are being made to overcome this problem by identifying the troublesome soybean components and eventually removing them or blocking their actions. However, conventional feeding tests with fish make such an identification process slow and expensive. We are proposing to develop cell lines from the Atlantic salmon intestine and to use them in vitro or in Petri dishes to rapidly and inexpensively identify the soybean components that are causing inflammation. This should speed up the development of fish feed in which fishmeal has been replaced with soybean meal. In the long run this will be beneficial to both Canadian aquaculture and soybean industries and to the Canadian consumer.",Aquiculture,"Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario

"Massive Stars are arguably the most important stars in the universe.  Their winds, which are  driven by intense pressure from their radiation, and the supernovae explosions at the ends of their lives produce most of the energy that's important for triggering star formation in the gas between stars.  The thermonuclear reactions in the interiors of these stars produce heavy elements that enrich the interstellar medium when these stars explode and slowly alter the compostition of new stars formed from this gas.  Supernova explosions produce neutron stars that are laboratories for studying matter at extreme densities and black holes that are laboratories for studying very high energy processes and gravity.

  I study the properties of massive binaries and the properties of the atmospheres and winds of massive magnetic stars which have peculiar element abundances.  My work on massive binaries is used to provide tests of models for the structure and evolution of binary stars.  My work on high mass X-ray binaries leads to a better understanding of the properties of neutron stars and black holes and the evolutionary process that produce these objects.  My work on the statistical properties of the the orbits of massive systems will lead to a better understanding of massive star formation, and add to the limited number of systems where we can determine the masses, radii, and luminosities of the stars.  This is important for constraining models for the evolution of these stars.  Finally my work on a few of these stars will lead to much better distance measurements to regions of extreme astrophysical importance.  This will lead to a better understanding of star formation and stellar evolution.","Sciences spatiales et astronomie","Avancement des connaissances","Space & Astronomy",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"Chlorine (Cl2) in water exists as hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypochlorite (OCl-) ions. These species absorb ultraviolet (UV) light to generate hydroxyl (OH) radicals. It is proposed to examine this system as a new ""Advanced Oxidation Process"" (AOP) for the degradation of pollutants in water. The OH radicals attack and oxidize organic pollutants. 

The UV/Cl2 AOP has the following potential advantages in comparison with the conventional UV/H2O2 AOP:

  1.  The molar absorption coefficient of HOCl at 254 nm is about 4 times higher than that of H2O2; hence, for the same concentration, HOCl absorbs 4 times more UV light than does H2O2.

  2.  HOCl and OCl- absorb strongly over the 200-300 nm region, whereas H2O2 absorbs significantly only below 255 nm. Hence, the UV/Cl2 AOP should perform much better than the UV/H2O2 AOP with medium pressure UV lamps.

  3.  The quantum yield for photolysis of HOCl is at least 1.0 and potentially higher in the presence of organics.



The general objectives of the proposed research are:

  Short-term goals:

     1.  Examine the possibility that the photolysis of chlorine in aqueous solution could be used as an AOP, since the photolysis generates OH radicals.

     2.  Determine the fluence-based rate constants for the destruction of simple organic contaminants, such as aliphatic alcohols and derivative of benzene and compare these rate constants with those using the UV/H2O2 AOP.

     3.  Extend the analysis to examine the destruction of more complex contaminants, such as the herbicide atrazine or naphthenic acid, a toxic component in tailings ponds from oil sands operations.



  Long-term goals:

     Over the long term, it is hoped that the approaches taken in this research will provide a practical and economic AOP for the remediation of contaminated waters.

"The robotic manipulators (also called robotic arms) used in Canadian industry today are dangerous machines that must be isolated from people using physical barriers.  An intrinsically safe, human-sized, robotic manipulator could operate close to humans to assist them both at work and at home.  Intrinsic safety would help to eliminate the need to make manipulators operating in human environments manually controlled and extremely slow moving. This technology would improve the safety of current applications and enable many new ones to be developed, e.g. assisting the elderly at home.  The proposed research will address the design and control of such a manipulator.  The research program will encompass the following subtopics:

i) Design of the robotic arm's actuators and mechanical structure to provide intrinsic safety.

ii) Development of methods for controlling the actuators to meet both performance and safety requirements.

iii) Development of methods for planning the movements of the robotic arm such that it performs its assigned task both efficiently and safely.

iv) Development of improved methods for picking up household and industrial objects using the mechanical hand of the robotic arm.



Three Ph.D. students, one Master's student and five undergraduate students will be trained during the research program. In addition to research skills, all graduate and undergraduate students will get hands-on experience with advanced robotics and automation equipment that will greatly benefit them in their future careers in Canadian industry or academia.

"Plant biomass is a potentially important renewable resource for the production of products such as biofuels. This is because plant biomass is composed primarily of cell walls, which are themselves rich in sugars that can be easily fermented to alcohols. In order to make biomass conversion cost-effective, concerted efforts need to be made to make the cell wall material more amenable to fuel conversion. Progress will be made when additional information regarding how cell walls are assembled and how their structure influences downstream processing is known. The proposed research aims to identify useful plant gene targets that, when modified, will lead to significant improvements in biomass processing. We will achieve this by using state of the art genetic screening methods and  molecular biology techniques. Our approach will also include the isolation of microorganisms that can efficiently convert the modified plant biomass; establishing a unique complementary plant-microbe approach for biomass conversion. We have already established that altered cell wall structure can lead to improved biomass conversion characteristics and that various soil microbes have the ability to differentially convert plant biomass into desirable end products. The success of our research program will position Canada as a strong player in this emerging market. Products derived from plant biomass have the potential to improve the sustainability of Canada's natural resources and environmental quality. In particular, it is expected that by offsetting fossil fuel use and their related emissions, these products will contribute to cleaner air and water.

"Biobased products have the potential to improve the sustainability of Canada's natural resources and environmental quality; this is because they can be used to offset our dependence on petroleum for the production of fuels and materials like plastics. Plants contain hundreds of components that are useful for biobased products. For example, the cell walls of plants are the source of familiar textiles like cotton and building materials like wood. However, some cell wall components can also be converted to plastics and fuels. Our research is aimed at understanding how plants make cell walls. We are particularly interested in how cellulose is made, since this is one of the main components of plant cell walls and since it has many potential uses. We are using the model plant Arabidopsis to help us gain insight into this important biological question.","Autres ressources d'�nergie","Ressources d'�nergie","Plant Biology & Food Science",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Many complex phenomena can only be understood on the basis of a quantum mechanical description of atomic interactions involving many electrons. My work involves the use of computer simulations and quantum mechanics calculations to study electronic, structural and dynamic properties of condensed matter systems arising from such interactions. 



When materials are compressed, increased electron-electron and electron-ion interactions can give raise to dramatic and often counterintuitive electronic and structural transitions. A goal of my research program is to predict such transitions and to provide explanation for the physical mechanism driving their occurrence. I am particularly interested in fundamental systems such as liquids and solids of the elements of group I of the periodic table, where we have discovered exotic liquid transitions and anomalous melting behaviour. Our findings are also relevant to planetary science and have helped to produce a new model for the structure of Jupiter.



Another area of interest is the study of molecular crystals, which transform to polymeric covalently bonded solids under pressure. Such materials can be used for energy storage if they are found to exhibit metastability at low pressure. We investigate the stability of polymeric solids in different chemical environments, near surfaces, and in the form of nano-clusters.



My research program also includes development of analytical and quantum simulation methods. An area of immediate interests is the computation of diffusion of impurities in solids, which will be achieved by a combination of density functional theory calculations and a lattice gas model.

"The proposal entitled 'Materials and Microwaves' will support an interdisciplinary program of research on the growth of complex electronic materials and measurement of their physical properties. The materials program builds on our existing strength in the growth of the world's cleanest crystals of the high temperature superconductor YBCO by exploring related transition metal oxides and the means of altering their properties through chemical doping, oxygen ordering and high pressure. This will include a major effort to achieve a high level of crystalline perfection in Tl2201, another prominent member of the family of  high temperature superconductors. The evolution of superconductivity as the doping of these materials is altered will be measured with a suite of in-house measurements of the electronic properties of the materials, including a variety of techniques for measuring microwave power absorption, the density of the superfluid, and a new apparatus to measure, for the first time in a high temperature superconductor, the London Hall effect. These will be brought together with a large array of other experimental techniques available through our collaborators in Canada and abroad. In turn the network of collaborations will give us access to other exotic electronic materials which will be studied with a new broadband microwave spectroscopy facility. This new experimental technique will allow us to measure power absorption in the microwave frequency range in samples cooled below 1 degree above absolute zero. At these low temperatures there are numerous physical phenomena and exotic states of matter that are expected to have unusual electronic absorption at correspondingly low frequencies, in the microwave range of the new spectrometer.

"This research deals with transportation, mostly by truck and rail, in multi-location inventory and logistics systems. Our concern is with total flows: Materials and components inbound to a factory or assembly plant, and finished goods outbound through a distribution system to retailers.  Shipments thus occur in a supply chain, from simple raw materials to consumer-purchase of final products.

     

     Keeping in mind the desirability of iterating between a current industrial application and its more general, academic framework, my research efforts will include:



1. Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) in Logistics Systems. Motivated by the success of MDO in Mechanical Engineering, here MDO treats inventory and transportation management as the separate ""disciplines."" They are linked by a model that gives a good solution to each, while maximizing supply chain profits. 

2. Shipment Consolidation (SCL) is the purposeful combining of several small loads into a bigger one, to achieve transport economies of scale. We are employing a new approach (viewing SCL as an ""Optimal Stopping Problem""), and also extending the analysis to multiple product types. 

3. Collaborative Transportation Management. Two trucking companies, normally competitors, may ""collaborate"" (share or re-allocate loads) to eliminate costs that neither could avoid alone. We will develop optimization models to aid this process.

4. Direct-to-Store Delivery. There are long lead times associated with shipments from China, say. Our DSD models will aim to reduce the controllable part of this lead time, i.e. that from the destination port to the local retail store.

"Two broad research needs motivate this equipment grant request to purchase a gamma counter: one focusing on the role of stress in the natural world and the other focusing on human health issues. For the first, the broad scale objectives of our research programs are to understand the ecology and evolution of mammals in nature, both at the individual and population levels, and the factors that both proximately and ultimately affect their success or failure. One of the fundamental realities of existence is the need to cope with stress. It impacts all organisms daily, affecting the ability to respond to challenges, compromising health, and accelerating the rate of aging processes. Animals in nature are exquisitely adapted to deal with short-term, but not chronic, stressors. The stress axis is a pivotal part of the neuroendocrine system that integrates environmental change and through which life history decisions to reproduce, to grow, or to put energy into storage are implemented. It is also subject to permanent modification by maternal programming during or after pregnancy. Five of us (from the Universities of Alberta, UBC, Guelph, Toronto, and Trent) work in northern Canada, a region where the inhabitants - plant, animal, and human - will be under enormous challenges given the changes that will occur this century as a result of global climate change. The requested equipment will allow all of us to integrate hormonal measures of the stress axis into our research programs using gamma emitters from commercially available kits. The second research need is related to two programs addressing fundamental research on human health. Both programs are based at the University of Toronto. First, it will be used in a program to understand how psychostimulants (drugs such as cocaine) affect behavioural and neurobiological responses to stress. Second, it will be used in the study of mammalian disease responses - the host cell-microbial mechanisms responsible for pathogenicity and the triggering of immune reaction or tolerance.

"Black holes are some of the most fascinating objects known to science.  Originally predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, there is now compelling observational evidence for their existence as real objects and not just theoretical constructs. Indeed they are linked to some of the most dramatic astrophysical phenomena including super-novae and active galactic nuclei.  Physical processes involving black holes (such as binary inspirals and gravitational collapse) are widely expected to be some of the brightest sources of gravitational waves and based on these expectations, gravitational wave observatories have been built all over the world. 

      The classical theory of black holes was developed in the 1960s and 70s, is mathematically elegant, and is the foundation for our theories of the above mentioned phenomena.  However as time has passed it has become more and more clear that while it gives an excellent description of non-evolving black holes it does not do nearly so good a job for dynamically evolving ones. My work focuses on the theory of dynamical black holes and ranges from horizons that are nearly in equilibrium with their surroundings to extremely dramatic evolutions such as when two black holes collide and merge. Each of these has their own challenge. For example given the massive distortion of the flow of time near to any black hole, in what sense can one ever be said to be slowly evolving? Conversely for the other extreme of possible behaviours, black hole boundaries sometimes appear to jump discontinuously but recent research has shown that this may not be the case and instead horizons may only be created or destroyed in conjunction with a kind of anti-horizon. 

      During the tenure of this grant I will study these various types of evolution and their fascinating theory not only for its own sake but also to develop tools that can be used to understand their physics as observed both in reality and in computer simulations.

"The general theme of this research proposal is protein-carbohydrate recognition with a focus on carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). Our focus is firmly placed on the recognition and degradation of the polysaccharide biomass in plant cell walls. CBMs and CAZymes are integral components of the microbial enzymes that perform the first step in reducing plant cell-wall polysaccharides to metabolizable sugars thus liberating photosynthetically fixed carbon. As the recycling of plant cell-wall polysaccharides, the most abundant biopolymers on Earth, is crucial to the carbon cycle, determining the functional aspects of CBMs and CAZymes is an important fundamental endeavour. Furthermore, in a world that is seeing rising levels of greenhouse gases, climate change, and rising oil prices eyes, are being increasingly turned to ""green"" science and alternative fuel sources.  For example, cellulases and amylases are classes of CBM-containing CAZymes that have been extensively used in converting plant cellulose and starch, respectively, into bio-ethanol for use in fuels. CAZymes and their CBMs will find an ever more prevalent role in processes that turn plant cell-wall polysaccharides into alternative fuels and environmentally friendly natural product materials. Research such as that proposed here will provide a foundation for designing and/or improving these processes.

"The main objective of the proposed research program is to develop a fundamental knowledge, a thorough understanding, and engineering foundation of the 5-axis laser micro/nano-machining technology for cost-effective, high-performance fabrication of high-value mould/die inserts with complex 3D geometry.  The emphasis will be on understanding and development of fundamentals, planning and parameter optimization of 3D laser-material removal process (LMRP). The proposed program is based on two most critical cross-linked research streams: (1) engineering modelling and performance optimization of 5-axis LMRP and (2) development of a methodology and system for intelligent planning of 5-axis LMRP.

   The research on engineering modelling and performance optimization of 5-axis LMRP will involve: a) modelling of LMRP as a complex dynamic system, where several dynamic processes in the laser-material interaction zone will be taken into consideration; b) analysis of a dynamic feedback loop represented by the plasma shielding effect and to be identified as a 3D optical transfer function; c) investigation of the plasma shielding effect during laser ablation; d) multi-variable optimization of process parameters in order to develop a phenomenological model for practical and automatic selection of optimal process parameters. 

  The research on intelligent planning of 5-axis LMRP will be focused on development of a novel integrated framework approach that incorporates (a) optimal with respect to minimum time laser machining sequence from a set of pre-identified machining features, and (b) optimal with respect to required accuracy, precision and surface quality 5-axis laser beam path trajectory for each pre-identified machining feature in accordance with process parameters optimally selected during performance optimization (first research stream).

   Undertaking this synergetic research will pursue innovative scientific and technological ideas with expected significance in development of strategic technology that will enhance competitiveness of Canadian companies.","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Mechanical Engineering - A",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) into enucleated oocytes has numerous applications for studying cellular processes (e.g., differentiation, reprogramming, cell cycle interactions, epigenetics), as well as in the production of cloned animals for different purposes such as to save endangered species, replicate genetically superior / high value animals, produce genetically modified animals, and to create animal models for medical research. 

The first goal of this research program is to investigate the occurrence and implication of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) on the viability and developmental capacity of swine embryos produced by SCNT. To date, most of the studies that investigated how the transplanted nuclei are reprogrammed in SCNT embryos have been focused on epigenetic mechanisms. However, given the number of technical procedures required for producing embryos by SCNT we hypothesize that DSBs play a crucial role in the developmental capacity of SCNT embryos. If not properly repaired, DSBs can lead to chromosome breakage and rearrangement, mutagenesis and abnormal gene function. 

A second goal of this research program is to produce a cloned transgenic pig model for the study of atherosclerosis. Using our successful protocol, we will produce cloned pigs with a reduced expression of the apolipoprotein E gene. Due to the fact that pigs and humans share many similarities in anatomy and pathophysiology (including vascular diseases and lipid metabolism), the transgenic pigs will be highly representative, and will provide crucial models for studying the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and for the development and testing of new therapeutics.

"Feeding is a motivated survival behavior, and like other motivated behaviors (e.g., procreation and drug taking) is heavily regulated by dopamine neurotransmission.  Motivation to eat is conditional and is regulated by allostatic processes that are driven by metabolic requirements. Receptors for several peptides that regulate food intake, ghrelin, orexin, insulin and leptin are abundantly expressed in the dopamine-containing cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that project to forebrain targets involved in motivation, such as the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum. The experiments outlined in this proposal aim to investigate the role of orexigenic (orexin, ghrelin) and satiety (insulin, leptin) peptides on dopamine neurons of the mesolimbic reward pathway.  Dopamine neurons can encode the salience of rewards in relation to de novo presented rewards or to reward predicting cues. Consistent with this, dopamine neurons alter their synaptic efficacy in correlation with the experience-dependent learning of cues that predict rewards. Our overall hypothesis is that peptides that signal hunger or satiety can alter the synaptic efficacy of dopamine neurons and resultant dopamine release. We predict that this enhanced dopamine neuronal signaling underlies a heightened salience to the environmental cues that predict reward. In the current proposal, we will measure the effects of orexigenic peptides, orexin and ghrelin, and anorexigenic peptides, insulin and leptin, on excitatory synaptic transmission of VTA dopamine neurons. We will then compare the effects of orexin, ghrelin and insulin on somatodendritic and terminal dopamine release. Finally, we will determine how endogenous activation of orexin neurons (via photostimulation) alters DA neuronal activity and the effects of ghrelin or insulin signaling in the VTA.

"RF and microwave design engineers rely heavily on commercially available software packages which are based on electromagnetic principles. Especially with respect to modern frequency assignment schemes, the choice of an initial design is certainly the most crucial part of any component or system development. Ultra-wideband (UWB), dual- and/or multi-band operations of wireless systems require frequency-agile transmit and receive capability (both on the circuit and antenna levels) to adapt to changing propagation scenarios and a rapidly increasing pool of new applications. 

Therefore, the principal objective of this research program is to develop new frequency-agile circuits, including their design guidelines, for tunable and/or switchable dual-, multi- and ultrawide-band filters. This activity will go along with new antenna configurations which allow the designer to directly integrate filtering capability into the antenna for interference suppression or service selection. A general objective of this research is also associated with applications other than communications. The increasing use of UWB technology in bio-medical applications is of particular interest. 

Special emphasis will be placed on the trade-off between circuit size, sensitivity and manufacturing tolerances. Prototyping is expected to utilize simple and commonly available printed-circuit fabrication. Existing equipment and facilities at the University of Victoria will be used to experimentally validate components and design procedures. This research will assist the Canadian wireless industry to seize competitive advantage in modern wireless applications.

The applicant has more than twenty years of experience in this general area of research. He is an IEEE Fellow and an internationally recognized expert in the areas of microwave CAD, filters and UWB antennas.

"This proposal primarily concerns a number of topics relating to the design and analysis of algorithms incluing potential application to the areas of information retrieval, algorithmic mechanism design and bio- informatics. My current focus is on the design and analysis of ""simple"" and efficient classes of algorithms, such as greedy algorithms, local search, dynamic programming and local ratio/primal dual algorithms. These general techniques are the starting point (and sometimes the most efficient algorithms known) for many combinatorial optimization and search problems. While the meaning of such algorithmic paradigms is intuitively understood, establishing a precise and ""useful"" model of such algorithms is a challenging area of research. We consider precise models which capture known algorithms but moreover allow us to prove limitations on a particular approach as well as possibly suggesting ideas for deriving new algorithms.

"My programs of research explore basic language processes (particularly those involved in reading and speech perception/production), as they relate to the hypothesis of modularity of mind, both from a behavioural/temporal perspective (i.e., using dependent measures such as reaction time), and a spatial perspective (i.e., using dependent measures that permit neuroanatomical localization). Dovetailed with these programs of research are other programs that strive to develop diagnostics of basic reading processes, improve methods of localization of function, and understand the nature of semantic representation. OBJECTIVES: The proposed research will shed light on the behavioural nature (i.e., staged versus parallel processing) and neuroanatomical location (i.e., unique versus shared regions of cortical processing) of the processes involved in basic language processing. SCIENTIFIC APPROACH: The behavioural modularity issue will be investigated using standard word and picture recognition tasks (e.g., overt naming, semantic judgments, lexical decision) and dependent measures (e.g., reaction time, error rates). The spatial modularity issue will be investigated using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while participants are engaged in these tasks. NOVELTY & EXPECTED SIGNIFICANCE: By applying Additive Factors Logic from behavioural techniques in cognitive psychology to the parameters extracted from fMRI Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) functions, we are developing a new method for functional localization that should be a vast improvement over the traditional Subtractive Method.  We are also continuing to develop new mathematical techniques for separating shared cortical functions from those that are unique to a particular task or stimulus. By bringing together these converging behavioural and functional methods to address questions of basic language function, we expect this research to have a broad impact on other domains of cognitive neuroscience that explore issues of mapping mind onto brain, and other domains of cognitive science that explore issues of parallel processing versus stages-of-processing.

"The project is concerned with the development of a new class of optical elements that we have pioneered. They are liquid mirrors (ferrofluids) shaped by magnetic fields. These optical elements have the important intrinsic advantage that liquids naturally follow equipotential surfaces to a very high precision. Consequently, we can make inexpensive high-quality optical elements that have very high performances. They allow us to take a wavefront having any shape and, after reflection, generate a wavefront having the shape that we desire. This feat is at the very heart of optics. We have recently demonstrated that our mirrors can generate deformations having amplitudes much larger than those of existing solid deformable mirrors. Because of their  performance and low cost these mirrors have considerable  technological and economical  potentials. The technology is far more versatile than conventional adaptive optics because it can generate deformations having amplitudes ranging from a fraction of a wave to hundreds of waves.

We are asking for funds to upgrade existing obsolete testing equipment which is used to test the performance of these mirrors with a very high spatial resolution.

"The primary objective of this proposal is to bring a new type adaptive optics (AO) mirror, pioneered by us, to practicality. The strong, multidisciplinary team will develop a new device in a novel application of AO in the manufacture of optical devices. A second mirror will be built and tested to demonstrate its significant advantages in biomedical imaging applications over current AO devices. The basic mirror consists of a thin reflective layer of silver nanoparticles spread on a magnetically deformable liquid (ferrofluid). The application of a magnetic field alters the shape of the fluid surface so that any arbitrary contour can be created and dynamically varied by changing the field. The ferrofluidic deformable mirror (FDM) is thus a very versatile adaptive optical element. The FDMs described in this proposal offer significant advantages over competing technologies: amplitudes of deformation varying from a few tens of nanometers to several tens of microns (several millimeters for large scale aberrations like defocus or coma) can be generated, fabrication costs are substantially lower, mirrors with large numbers of actuators can be produced and the mirror has a good temporal response. For the optical testing and biomedical applications, we will optimise mirror control, mirror speed and we will change the design to increase the robustness and stability to transport of the unit. A recent major hardware design improvement that applies a magnetic bias gives a linear response makes mirror control simpler and lowers the required currents. It also allows miniaturisation of actuators, giving the small size necessary to the biomedical mirror and the large number of actuators and fine control, necessary to the optical testing application. The mirror will be tested and optimised in real world applications: the testing of complex optics and the high resolution imaging of eyes. This project will be undertaken in close collaboration with industry partners who will assist in mirror development and evaluation and in student training.","Technologie de l'instrumentation","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Manufacturing",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"My general objective is to study causes and consequences of stress in birds from a life history perspective. Stress is ubiquitous in the lives of animals with pervasive consequences to their well being. How individuals perceive, respond to and cope with stressors is crucial to an animal's physiology, behaviour and ecology. How physiological mechanisms mediate the relationship between the animal and its environment help us better understand the diversification of life histories, i.e., strategies to optimize the allocation of limited resources. Life history trade offs are particularly notable when animals are exposed to stressors for they must allocate limited resources (e.g. energy, nutrients such as carotenoids, immune function) between the competing demands of dealing with the stressor and maintaining condition. The testable hypothesis is that the optimal strategy should vary with the cost to individual condition and nature of the stressor. I use both wild and captive birds to study stress in the context of reproductive effort, sexual ornamentation and how birds deal with anthropogenic disturbances. Although I will assess condition, health and stress in many ways, I will especially use a novel technique I developed for quantifying corticosterone (stress hormone) in feathers that allows for a long-term evaluation (days to months) of stress physiology. I will manipulate such stressors as parasite loads, diet, food supply and environmental temperature to investigate the role of stress in mediating such trade offs as parental effort vs condition, and number vs quality of offspring. Similarly, I will investigate experimentally how corticosterone and testosterone mediate trade offs between the use of carotenoids for coloration of sexual ornaments vs. immune function. I also directly manipulate hormone levels with implants, and pharmacologically test the capacity of components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (stress) axis that may help explain the great variation within and among species in their response to, and consequences of, stress. The novelty of my approach will take the field of stress research in new directions, with impacts in basic science, veterinary medicine, animal husbandry, conservation biology and wildlife management.

"An important aspect of Science and Engineering (and indeed life in general) is to quantify relationships. Many of these are basically simple. For example, one may ask how the strength of a beam depends on its thickness. Other relations are more complex and involve many factors. For example, no one would claim to understand exactly how ""happiness"" depends on factors such as money, health, friendships (and possibly many more). Mathematically, relationships are encoded by the formal means of a ""function"".

These functions may be complex, difficult to compute and hence in order to extract any desired information from them there arises the need to be able to estimate and evalutate them. This is the basic topic of my main field of study Multivariate Approximation Theory. Specifically I study theoreticall aspects of ways to approximate complicated functions (relationships) by combinations of simple ones -- usually of a very specific type called polynomials, but other types are possible. For example, I try to figure out what happens to certain types of procedures when more and more information is used in the approximation procedure. Another specific example is to try to estimate complicated functions (volatility surfaces) that arise in the pricing of financial instruments by means of simpler entities called splines.

"The subject of Measurable Dynamics or, as it is often called, Ergodic Theory, has a long and rich history of connections to other areas of dynamics (for example, topological dynamics and smooth dynamics) and to other mathematical fields such as number theory, geometry, and probability theory.  Recently, and especially with the advent of computers capable of performing numerical experiments, there has been a renaissance in applications to other areas of science as diverse as engineering, information science, biology, climate science and geophysics.



The basic structural requirement for Ergodic Theory is a set (state space), a probability measure on the set, and a mapping or transformation from the set to itself. We also require that the action of the map respects (or leaves invariant) the probability measure. From this simple setting a vast array of theoretical machinery is available to study asymptotic, i.e. long term and on average, behavior of the system. 



While some applications come equipped with a natural invariant measure, most do not. It is therefore of critical interest to find ways to infer rigorously the presence of an invariant measure and, if possible, to make estimates or approximations of it so that the results of  Ergodic Theory may be given in quantifiable form. 



This proposal describes a program of research in theoretical and computational Ergodic Theory which will therefore be of interest to researchers in the field and to scientists in other areas.

"My research area is Computational Geometry, a field devoted to the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures for geometric problems. My research focuses both on theoretical and practical issues. The geometric application areas I concentrate on include adhoc routing in wireless networks, geometric networks, mesh generation/manipulation, graph drawing, visualization and pattern recognition. An algorithm that is proven to be theoretically efficient often fails to be practically useful as it may only become efficient when the size of the problem is unreasonably large or the algorithm may be too complex to implement. However, the existence of theoretically efficient algorithms often provides insights into a problem and leads to the development of algorithms that are equally efficient in practice. The main goal of my research has been and continues to be to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency by finding practical algorithmic solutions to applied geometric problems that have theoretical performance guarantees. Below, I provide an example of the type of geometric problems I am currently concentrating on.



Communication between wireless devices has an inherent geometric component since these devices have a physical location which is constantly changing. Problems in this area are particularly challenging since the network is dynamic, i.e. the wireless devices are usually moving. Moreover, this dynamic nature means that no single entity has complete knowledge of the whole network, requiring the development of algorithms that are online and use little memory. My research in this area focuses on the following themes: (1) How to route (i.e. find a path) efficiently in a geometric network, (2) How to construct geometric networks with certain desirable properties?

"Aeroservoelasticity deals with the interactions between structural dynamics, flight controls and unsteady aerodynamics. On a modern aircraft, equipped with active control systems such as flutter suppression, gust load alleviation and other systems, these control systems introduce significant challenges in terms of design, engineering analysis and certification. This technology requires the development of sophisticated software that dictates the control laws of the aircraft. When designing this software, attention has to be given to the aircraft's handling qualities and the effects of the control surfaces on the aircraft's characteristics. While active control systems can improve aerodynamics, loads and flutter, a poorly designed system can make these characteristics worse. 

The proposed research work will primarily be dedicated to 3 aspects: 1. the identification and validation of an aircraft model; 2. the design and validation of flutter suppression and of a gust load alleviation system and 3. the interactions between flutter suppression, gust load alleviation systems and flexible aircraft structure. The proposed research will be performed on the F/A-18 aircraft model to which access will be granted by the NASA DFRC laboratories. 

The proposed research (aircraft model identification and validation, active control laws design) will be conducted by using novel parameter estimation methods and validated with flight flutter test data. These new methods will use modern theories such as the neural network and the fuzzy logic theories. The originality of this proposed work mainly resides in the research on the interactions between the gust load alleviation and flutter suppression systems with the flexible aircraft structure. The aeroservoelastic interactions of the resultant forces of these active control systems on the flexible aircraft structure will be studied, where these forces will be optimized and analyzed.

"The funding requested in this application will be used to acquire a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS).  This instrument will be used by several researchers to advance work on: 1) development and implementation of new, rapid, sensitive and selective analytical methods for chemical analysis of small molecules, and 2) characterization of biomolecules and novel synthetic materials (i.e., molecules, complexes and polymers). Compounds/molecules that will be analyzed in this work pose risks to the environment or human health, or  represent potential commercial or scientific value, for example, compounds that are chemically-active (e.g. catalysts), biologically-active (e.g. nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals) or are functional materials (e.g. biopolymers, new materials for energy use or storage, etc.). The use of MALDI- MS for sensitive and high throughput analysis of small molecules is still not common, but it is anticipated that the ground-breaking methods developed in this work will be useful for environmental protection, where mitigation and control of toxic compounds in the environment rely on rapid, sensitive analytical methods, and for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical analysis, where rapid screening methods are necessary for quality assurance. The methods for analysis water-borne contaminants will provide a means for broader screening programs and better assessment of the state of the environment and water supplies in Canada.  Furthermore, the analytical capabilities of the system will be essential for research on development of more environmentally-friendly chemical processes (green chemistry, green catalysts), development of new pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals, and more productive use of waste products like wood and fish waste; all outcomes of economic value.  Another important benefit to Canada will be the high-quality training and hands-on experience provided on this instrument to tens of undergraduate and graduate students each year. The resulting skill-set is consistently in demand in medicine, industrial R&D, environmental analysis, etc.","Oc�ans et eaux int�rieures","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)",Chemistry,1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Newfoundland and Labrador",Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador
"Based on scientific studies suggesting negative consequences for human and environmental health, the presence of chemical contaminants in water has garnered significant public attention in recent years. Although great strides have been made to improve the quality of the environment through controls on emissions of toxic chemicals, it has been found that adulteration of our water resources is continuing and, likely, worsening. The sources of contamination are wide-ranging, with inputs from industrial effluent, domestic wastewater (contaminated with, for example, excreted pharmaceuticals and byproducts of disinfection for pathogens), agricultural and urban run-off, and atmospheric fall-out. The contaminants themselves are quite diverse, including toxic metals, inorganic anions, organohalogens, numerous and varied polar organic compounds, etc. The polar analytes are a particular challenge with respect to chemical analysis as they are not typically amenable to analysis by the usual approaches. Development of sensitive methods to detect and quantify these water-borne compounds while providing a means for rapid screening of numerous samples is required to help mitigate input of toxic compounds to surface water. 



In this program of research, the central theme will be the development of fast and sensitive methods for analysis of polar water-borne contaminants using two instruments: a capillary electrophoresis system and a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometer. Although our work explicitly focuses on environmental contaminants, the methods developed for the analysis of pharmaceuticals could find application in forensics, clinical analysis and the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, our approach will advance ""green"" analytical methods that consume and generate lower levels of hazardous solvent, while maintaining standards for sensitive and robust analyses.

"This proposal aims to contribute to the development of new generations of materials for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) as part of the $10M Technology Development Project (TDP) of the NRC jointly with Ballard and AFCC. More specifically, the proposed research will focus on the detailed characterization of new catalyst materials with lower Pt loading and new catalyst-support materials under the global TDP aims of 1) reduce the material cost of the 5th Generation PEMFC by as much as 60%. 2) increase the durability of the fuel cells by replacing the carbon support with more robust material 3) increase the efficiency of the PEMFC by allowing high operating temperatures. The research will use advanced electron microscopy methods to provide quantitative structural and compositional information of alloy catalyst (with lower Pt loading) so that the synthesis can be effectively tuned to improve on the performance of the materials. In parallel, the research will also provide structural and chemical bonding information on new non-carbon support materials for 95deg.C applications and new

transition metal oxides support for the 160-200deg.C applications. We will use a combination of high-resolution imaging, spectroscopy, quantitative electron microscopy, modeling and tomographic techniques at various length-scales (from the atomic level to nm ranges) to study particles structures, composition, chemical state (valence, coordination) and the 3-dimensional structure of the catalyst-support systems. The world-class advanced electron microscopy facilities of the Canadian Centre for Electron Microscopy will be used for this work. Jointly with researchers at the NRC (ICPET, IFCI) who will provide new materials and properties information jointly with industrial partners in the TDP, this proposal presents a unique convergence of expertise in characterization, infrastructure and synthesis that is unique by world standards and it will help

Canadian fuel cell industry compete in a growing market requiring greener sources of energy. The contribution of Ballard, the industrial partner, to the TDP is $250K/year cash and $249K/year in-kind for 3 years.","Ressources d'�nergie (production, exploration, traitement, distribution et utilisation de l'�nergie)","Ressources d'�nergie","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario
"This proposal aims to support an ambitious research program related to the study of chemical bonding and structure in nanoscale materials. The research takes advantage of the world-unique infrastructure that the applicant has developed within the Brockhouse Institute for Materials Research as part of the new Canadian Centre for Electron Microscopy (CCEM). The new instruments make it possible to probe with unprecedented spatial and spectroscopic resolution the bonding and structural properties of materials with nanoscale dimensions in order to understand the underlying role of defects, interfaces and surfaces in the direct control of the functional properties of these materials. In order to achieve this goal, this research will address the fundamental question of size effects on phase stability and reactions of nanoscale materials (nanoparticles and nanocrystalline solids) used in applications such as energy storage and catalysis. This work will make use of the ex-situ environmental cells of one of the aberration corrected microscopes at the CCEM. In parallel, the research will address the fundamental role of interfaces and strain in ultrathin films in terms of functional properties and stability of phases. Interfaces in multilayers of functional oxides will be studied with sub-Angstrom resolution to understand the detailed atomic arrangements, the distribution of strain at interfaces and defects, bonding (chemical state and coordination) and the electronic structure so as to provide new information to understand the unique electrical properties of these materials. 



These areas of research, the interdisciplinary nature of the work and the new world-unique infrastructure make this research program fully eligible to the areas (proposals 2,3,4 and 5) of the 00-02 reallocation exercise.

"Pour se prot�ger contre une multitude d'agresseurs, les plantes poss�dent deux grandes voies immunitaires : l'extinction g�nique post-transcriptionelle (le silencing) et la reconnaissance des �liciteurs. Le silencing est un moyen de d�fense qui cible l'ARN double brin (ARNdb), la mol�cule-cl� de ce processus. L'ARNdb est ainsi  reconnu par une enzyme, Dicer, puis hydrolys� en petits ARN d'interf�rence (21-25 nucl�otides). Ceux-ci sont alors pris en charge par le complexe enzymatique � RNA-induced silencing complex � (RISC) qui effectue en raison de ses activit�s h�licase et ARNase, la d�gradation s�quence-sp�cifique de l'ARN viral. La reconnaissance de mol�cules �licitrices constitue une deuxi�me voie utilis�e par les plantes pour activer certaines d�fenses. Les �liciteurs impliqu�s peuvent �tre g�n�raux ou sp�cifiques. La reconnaissance de ces �liciteurs induit une cascade de signalisation qui m�ne � une r�sistance locale gouvern�e par l'acide salicylique (AS) ou l'acide jasmonique (AJ). Cette r�sistance locale est suivie d'une r�sistance syst�mique acquise permettant ainsi � la plante enti�re de se prot�ger contre l'agresseur. La r�sistance contre les pathog�nes biotrophes n�cessite la voie de l'AS alors que la voie de l'AJ est requise pour se d�fendre contre les pathog�nes n�crotrophes, ces deux voies (AS et AJ) pouvant �tre antagonistes.



Mon programme de recherche consiste � �tudier le dialogue qui existe entre les voies immunitaires (Silencing et �licitation, d'une part, la voie de l'AS et l'AJ d'autre part) ainsi que les strat�gies utilis�es par certains agents pathog�nes pour d�tourner ces r�ponses immunitaires. Nous nous int�ressons aux moyens utilis�s par des agents pathog�nes pour manipuler le dialogue entres ces voies immunitaires et ainsi causer la maladie. Ce programme de recherche devrait contribuer fortement � la d�couverte de nouvelles strat�gies de lutte phytosanitaires non n�fastes pour la sant� humaine et plus respectueuses de l'environnement.

La proposition de recherche actuelle vise une meilleure compr�hension de la dynamique �volutive des arbustaies issues de la d�prise agricole, tr�s importantes dans la restructuration des paysages agro-forestiers et pourtant m�connues. L'h�ritage de l'activit� agricole peut se faire sentir pour des centaines d'ann�es et retarder les processus de succession.

"Mes travaux de recherche portent principalement sur les syst�mes d'intelligence artificielle (IA) pour l'assistance aux personnes �g�es et atteintes de la maladie d'Alzheimer, � l'int�rieur de leur domicile (habitat intelligent). L'approche de l'habitat intelligent r�f�re � un concept voulant que l'on miniaturise un ensemble de dispositifs �lectroniques (capteurs et effecteurs) afin de les int�grer dans la plupart des objets du quotidien (lampes, frigo, cuisini�re, etc.) de mani�re transparente pour l'usager, dans le but de l'assister. Une des difficult�s majeures inh�rentes � ce type d'assistance est la reconnaissance des activit�s de la vie quotidienne r�alis�es par le patient. Cette reconnaissance est fondamentale afin d'identifier l'ensemble des plans erron�s de fa�on � adapter l'assistance en fonction du type d'erreurs commises. Ainsi, le programme de recherche que je propose consiste � pousser beaucoup plus loin les recherches sur ce probl�me important en explorant plusieurs avenues prometteuses. Dans un premier temps, nous proposons de formaliser la notion d'erreur en fournissant un ensemble de � sch�mas comportementaux �, permettant la classification et l'identification de l'ensemble des cat�gories d'agissements erratiques des patients Alzheimer (s�quence, omission, r�alisation, etc.). Ensuite, nous souhaitons exploiter la th�orie des possibilit�s qui permet d'int�grer la notion d'incertitude (probabilit�) et celle d'impr�cision (logique floue), n�cessaire dans le cas d'une reconnaissance d'activit�s orient�e capteurs. Enfin, nous voulons introduire les �l�ments contextuels et temporels (heures, profil du patient, routines).



Ce projet est d'une grande importance dans notre soci�t� vieillissante. Le type de technologie sur lequel nous oeuvrons a le potentiel de repousser le moment de l'institutionnalisation des individus atteints d'Alzheimer, en r�duisant la charge de travail des personnes ressources, tout en redonnant une autonomie partielle aux patients. Ce type d'approche pourrait constituer une solution viable au probl�me de l'accroissement des co�ts reli�s aux soins � domicile.

"The world effort in fusion research has initiated a major step forward in the next large scale experiment called ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), a burning plasma experiment dedicated to demonstrate de feasibility of thermonuclear fusion as a power source. Even if such a large scale project is underway, fundamental physics issues remain and can be addressed in existing tokamaks, the magnetic geometry of ITER. The objective of the present research program is to study the flow of the main species of the plasma in the scrape off layer (SOL) of tokamaks. It is speculated that such plasma flows may be responsible for the spread of tritium inside the reactor. Therefore, from a technical standpoint, if these flows are not better understood and controlled, activation resulting from the trapping of tritium may shorten the useful life of the fusion reactor. From a more fundamental physics standpoint, these flows are now being invoked as being part of the underlying mechanisms in the confinement regimes in tokamaks. Consequently, a better understanding of these flows leading to their control will bring about a more efficient control of the thermonuclear furnace.

These flows can be measured using different techniques. In this program, we will use the so-called Gundestrup electrostatic probes developed on TdeV. This type of probe consists in an array of collectors which enables the simultaneous determination of both the parallel and perpendicular component, relative to the confinement magnetic field, of the velocity therefore giving a direct estimate of the main ion plasma flow vector. This technique has been used in recent years by us and other researchers in several tokamaks around the world.

This experimental program requires access to tokamaks. This will be achieved in the framework of national and international collaborations with laboratories where tokamaks are being run.

"To extend the worldwide task of reduction in GHG emissions, the Kyoto Protocol (KP) allow reforestation and afforestation activities to be accounted for carbon (C) sequestration. While black spruce is generally well adapted to regenerate after wildfire, poor regeneration can sometimes occur, resulting in the irreversible conversion of closed-crown black spruce feathermoss stands to open black spruce-lichen woodlands (OWs). The large amount of available OWs within the closed-crown boreal forest in the province of Qu�bec - and probably further more across the boreal forest of Canada - represents a significant theoretical potential for C sequestration and offset of industrial GHG emissions. However, several uncertainties associated to this potential need to be addressed to minimize the range of uncertainties and maximize the mitigation benefits of an OW afforestation project. The research proposal addresses these important uncertainties, in two distinct research axes: 1) The support capacity of OWs to afforestation, in terms of both wood yield and soil fertility; 2) The permanence of C stocks in afforested OWs, particularly the integration of wood products and bioenergy, and the impact of natural disturbances. There are at least 3 indicators that illustrate the value of expected results and the industrial relevance of the proposed research. First, the ultimate outcome of the results will be to help the main industrial partner of the team to comply to its national obligations under the Canadian Regulatory framework for air emissions (RFAE), through the system of ""domestic offset credits"". Also, the boreal OW afforestation is an advantageous offset method compared to other methods. For instance, the boreal OW afforestation represents no (or very few) lost of opportunity, contrary to afforestation on fallow lands or abandoned agricultural lands where conflicts often arise because of ownership rights or other possible land

utilizations; also, afforestation is one of the cheapest and low C-intensive mitigation method. Thirdly, the outcome of the proposed research might also help Canada to reach its own long-term reduction objectives under the RFAE, and to comply to its international obligations under the KP.",Environnement,Environnement,"RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

L'analyse de la d�pendance, et la construction d'outils pour mod�liser celle-ci, sont mises de l'avant dans lors de l'utilisation de tels mod�les.

"Current diagnoses of pathologies such as cancer rely on cellular evaluation of tissue samples excised through biopsy procedures. While this technique allows for evaluation of diseased cells, biopsies are uncomfortable for the patient, often hazardous, sample processing is time-consuming, and only a limited portion of a much larger organ is evaluated, resulting in a number of false-negative diagnoses. Optical imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) are non-invasive optical technologies capable of producing high resolution images of cells at different depth through small, fibre-optics based instruments. The recent developments in biophotonics research have led to new smaller, more sensitive instruments having imaging speeds that allow non-invasive investigation of larger areas, reducing the risks associated with biopsies. Within the last decade, both these technologies (RCM and OCT) were shown to yield high quality structural (OCT), cellular and sub-cellular (RCM) images in vivo. However, the lack of specific contrast agents that would reproduce the effect of stains used on biopsy samples, limits their clinical utility to the few organs on which biopsies are impracticable. The objective of the proposed research program is to exploit linear and non-linear photon-tissue interactions to increase contrast and specificity of clinical microscopy images in ways that are compatible with constraints associated with the geometry of imaging endoscopes. The originality of this approach consists in combining tools traditionally used by biologists with newly developed optical diagnostics tools to yield high-resolution non-invasive endoscopic imaging with highly specific contrast. The research program includes the development of photonics tools that will enable the rapid transfer to the clinics, and lead to the development of the next generation of medical imaging endoscopes capable of non-invasively imaging human organs in vivo with cellular sensitivity and molecular specificity. These novel optical diagnostics technologies will provide enhanced diagnostics capability, allowing detection of diseases at earlier stages, where chances of survival and cure are the greatest.","Appareils et instruments m�dicaux","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Electromag. & Electr.

"The development of DNA biosensors has accelerated tremendously over the past few years and recent advances

in our laboratories have resulted in a novel nucleic acid sensing technology called Fluorescence Chain Reaction

(FCR), which gives rise to a several thousand-fold amplification of the fluorescence signal emitted upon

hybridization with a target DNA strand. This biosensor, once coupled to micron-sized particles, has the

potential to provide rapid (less than 1 hour) and specific (discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphism,

SNP) diagnostic procedures at such low concentration levels that neither PCR amplification nor chemical

tagging is necessary, thereby dramatically reducing complexity and cost while improving reliability and speed

of analysis.

Our central long-term objective is to integrate application-specific biosensing beads directly into microfluidic

devices that will be distributed as ""ready-to-use"" consumables. The main objective of this (Phase I Innov)

research proposal is the development of an efficient fabrication process for the biosensing beads that will

provide optimal analytical performances (sensitivity and selectivity) and stability (shelf life) in packaging and

delivery systems for targeted market segments, thereby establishing the commercial viability of the technology.

This project is particularly important if we want to transfer this technology to end users for various day-to-day

applications. Only robust, affordable and ""user-friendly"" methods have the opportunity to compete with the

well-established PCR methods.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"I2IPJ ","Idea to Innovation","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"More than 250,000 blood units are transfused each year in the province of Quebec alone. In order to provide safe blood to hospitals, blood bank facilities must test every donor and recipient for the presence of several red cell antigens. Because of population aging, of the increasing number of transfusions and of the complexity and limited sample throughput of currently available technology used to test for these antigens, the procurement of matched blood represents a growing operational problem for blood banks. The purpose of the project proposed herein is to develop a rapid and simple method for the identification of blood genotypes using a molecular sensing scheme called Fluorescence Chain Reaction (FCR) recently demonstrated by our research team. This novel detection scheme combines specific oligonucleotide probes and an optical polymeric transducer and is able to detect as little as 5 copies of genetic material in 5 minutes with the specificity required to distinguish single nucleotide polymorphisms. Such as detection capability, which is several orders of magnitude ahead of any other approach currently in development, has the potential to provide fast, reliable and affordable molecular typing procedures at concentration levels such that prior chemical amplification or tagging will no longer be necessary. This research project will focus on increasing FCR's specificity and robustness towards variations in experimental conditions and for sample compositions that are representative of those found in the genotyping of clinically relevant antigens of blood donors and recipients. Continued development of this technology through the studies and experiments described in the present proposal will have a massive impact in the biotechnology/biomedical sectors and on public health issues, and we believe that scientists and industries in various fields, including our partner Hema-Quebec, will greatly benefit from this technology.

Plus de 250 000 unit�s de sang sont transfus�es chaque ann�e dans la seule province de Qu�bec. Afin de pouvoir fournir un produit s�curitaire aux h�pitaux, les banques de sang doivent tester chaque donneur et chaque r�cipiendaire pour la pr�sence de plusieurs antig�nes de globules rouges. � cause du vieillissement de la population, du nombre croissant de patients transfus�s et de la cadence analytique insuffisante de la technologie actuellement disponible, la mise � la disposition des h�pitaux d'unit�s de sang compatible avec les r�cipiendaires repr�sente un d�fi grandissant pour les banques de sang. Ce projet vise le d�veloppement d'une m�thode rapide et simple pour le g�notypage sanguin bas�e sur le principe de Fluorescence Chain Reaction (FCR) d�montr� r�cemment par notre �quipe de recherche.

"The intestinal epithelium is a highly dynamic renewal system organized in crypts, that are populated by proliferative cells, and villi composed of differentiated cells.  Stem cells at the bottom of the crypts constantly produce precursor cells that undergo a succession of molecular changes that utimately lead to an arrest of proliferation and a commitment to differentiate.  Although some clues have been collected over the past years on the nature of the molecular mechanisms that are required for the induction of cellular differentiation in this particular context, the regulatory circuit involved into the maintenance of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation that is required for continuous renewal of this epithelium still remains poorly defined.  The progress of our research has led to the identification of a specific gene regulator (nuclear co-receptor repressor) as being crucial to maintain intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in culture.  The pigment-epithelial-derived-factor gene, a potent inhibitor of cellular proliferation in a number of different cell systems, was identified to be down-modulated by the nuclear co-receptor repressor.  The main objective of this proposal is further characterize the exact molecular mechanims by which the nuclear co-receptor repressor can target this gene and maintain intestinal epithelial cell proliferation.  In addition, genetically modified mouse models will be generated in which the expression of the nuclear co-receptor repressor will be specifically impaired within the intestinal epithelium.  These approaches should highlight the exact role for this regulator into normal intestinal epithelial physiology and in long term, contribute to the development of novel therapeutic tools for deregulated fonctions of the intestinal epithelium.

"Les manipulateurs parall�les sont constitu�s d'un organe terminal qui est reli� � une base par au moins deux pattes. Ces types de manipulateurs ont certains avantages sur des manipulateurs s�riels, surtout au niveau de la raideur et du rapport charge utile/masse du manipulateur. Par contre, ils ont certains d�savantages vis-�-vis les manipulateurs s�riels, comme par exemple, un espace de travail plus restreint. L'exemple le plus connu d'un manipulateur parall�le est un simulateur de vol. L'analyse des manipulateurs parall�les est g�n�ralement plus complexe que celle des manipulateurs s�riels et leurs propri�t�s cin�matiques sont loin d'�tre intuitives. Il est tr�s difficile de choisir de fa�on intuitive les param�tres g�om�triques de sorte � optimiser la performance d'un manipulateur parall�le. 

Le premier objectif de ce programme de recherche est d'effectuer la synth�se des manipulateurs parall�les spatiaux.  La synth�se implique la d�termination des param�tres architecturaux, par exemple les dimensions du manipulateur, pour satisfaire certains crit�res  sp�cifi�s d'avance. Des exemples de crit�res pourraient �tre un espace de travail prescrit d'une certaine dimension et forme, ou avoir une rigidit� maximis�e dans une direction donn�e. L'algorithme g�n�tique, qui est une m�thode d'optimisation bas�e sur la th�orie d'�volution de Darwin, sera utilis� pour l'optimisation. Le deuxi�me objectif est d'effectuer la synth�se des manipulateurs parall�les redondants du point de vue cin�matique. Ce type de manipulateurs comporte plus de liaisons et de membres que le nombre minimum requis pour effectuer une t�che. Ainsi, il y a une infinit� de valeurs des variables articulaires qui permettent d'atteindre une position et orientation sp�cifi�es de l'organe terminal. Ceci rend la synth�se plus complexe que pour des manipulateurs non redondants.

Le d�veloppement de m�thodes de synth�se pour l'optimisation de la performance des manipulateurs parall�les facilitera grandement le travail des concepteurs de ces m�canismes.

"Multicellular organisms are comprised of a variety of cell types with unique shapes that are dictated primarily by scaffolding molecules located inside the cells.  The ability of cells to either maintain or change their conformation has profound and direct implications on their function within an organism.  Understanding how scaffolding proteins influence cell shape and function is the primary objective of the present grant application.  The proposed studies are particularly focused on understanding the functions of one family of scaffolding proteins known as plakins.  Plakins are particularly enriched in tissues that undergo significant mechanical stress such as skin and muscle and are thought to preserve the organization of these tissues when they are stretched or compressed.  In humans, genetic lesions associated with certain plakin family members result in skin blistering disorders and muscular dystrophies.  The applicant is particularly interested in determining the importance of plakins in skeletal muscle.  To achieve this objective, studies to assess the localization of bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (Bpag1), one specific plakin family member, in muscle tissue and studies to identify Bpag1-interacting proteins are envisioned.  Furthermore, studies to determine the relative contributions of different plakin family members during the proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells are proposed.  Collectively, these studies are expected to provide new insights into the fundamental structure and function of muscle fibers and will enhance our understanding of myopathies that are related to disruptions of the muscle fiber architecture.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Artificial joint prostheses are used to replace diseased articular surfaces and provide pain relief for patients. After approximately 10 years of service, these artificial joints often cause major complications such as, bone re-fracture, infection and implant failure. These failed implants need to be replaced through costly revision surgeries, that are more difficult with less satisfactory outcomes compared to the primary replacement. These complications have been linked to the production of wear particles at the articular joint surface and bone loss also known as bone remodeling at the bone-implant interface. This bone remodeling is a major issue in artificial joint replacement particularly for elderly patients suffering from osteoporosis or osteoarthritis. Currently, most implants used in joint replacements are made from stiff materials such as titanium and cobalt-chrome alloys. The use of such implants changes the levels of stress within the bone, resulting in bone remodeling adjacent to the implant.  Therefore, it is important to understand, monitor and control the remodeling that occurs around implants. The aim of this research is to improve the joint implants design by developing, implementing and validating an advanced mathematical framework for bone remodeling. This unique mathematical framework uses irreversible thermodynamics to combine all factors, mechanical, and metabolic (biological and chemical) which are simultaneously at play in the bone remodeling process. This advanced model has multiple potential applications in predicting bone remodeling and patient therapy. In the short term, it will assist in improving the design of metallic and biomimetic prostheses. It will also be used to assess and monitor the risk of bone re-fracture after surgical procedures such as total hip and hip resurfacing arthroplasty. Over the long term it can form a basis for virtual simulations of bone diseases associated with bone resorption such as osteoporosis, which will allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

"Synthetic images and animations of real scenes are now common place in different domains such as medicine, computer games, feature films, TV advertising, homeland security, and fine arts. Creating these images and animation is the first goal of computer graphics.  Traditional computer graphics approaches start with geometric models and then generate and display virtual representations. Many computer graphics approaches have been successful. However, it is clear that synthetic images and animation still look artificial and that the cost and time have to be lowered.  In the past, the field of computer graphics has been considered  as the inverse of computer vision. Indeed, computer vision starts with input images and videos and process them to understand the geometric and physical properties of objects and scenes. The objectives of my research are the integration of computer vision and computer graphics techniques, and the creation of a framework in which these two domains collaborate through machine learning techniques to model the world around us (e.g. human body and motion, natural scenes, rigid and non-rigid objects) directly from measurements. These measurements will be learned from real images and scenes.  Indeed, recent years have seen a significant technological development in the areas of high-quality sensors which have simplified the acquisition of the world content.

This unified view could make a leap of cost and quality. For instance, it should be less costly to make a 3D model of  a human directly from images and videos, than to have an artist construct such a model by hand. This unified view will also eliminate the need for many of the heuristics generally used,  and will create major new opportunities and sub-problems that it is our objective to address.

"Most of practical systems are stochastic and nonlinear. Dynamical systems of this type must in their functioning meet performance requirements and maintain acceptable behavior even in the presence of abrupt changes in their dynamics due, to random component failures or repairs, abrupt environmental disturbances, changes in subsystems interconnections, abrupt changes in the operating point of nonlinear plant, etc. Systems with this behavior may be modeled as hybrid ones, that is, to the state variable usually used in system theory, a discrete random variable called the mode, or regime is appended. The mode describes the random jumps of the systems parameters and the occurrence of the discontinuities. One of the most important hybrid class of systems is the one called systems with Markovian jumping parameters, in which the mode-process is a Markov chain taking values in a finite set.



This class of systems has attracted a lot of researchers and many contributions were reported in the literature. All of these contributions are established under the assumption that the transitions probabilities or the transitions jump rates are totally known which makes all the established results useless in practice. In this research, I will address the theoretical and practical aspects for this class of systems when the transitions probabilities and the transitions jump rates are partially or totally unknown. Manufacturing systems and network control systems will be used to get some generic models that I will use in the theoretical research. My research program aims at developing mathematical models and methods for the design, analysis, optimization, and control of such systems. In my research, I will search for less conservative control algorithm that can be solved using the existing convex optimization tools. Beside this, I will also consider the control of systems whose dynamics contain stochastic time-delay and randomness in the form of a Brownian motion with state discontinuities.

"With the recent advances in wireless communication and mobile networking coupled with the growing interest of The Government of Canada to make our transportation system safer, more reliable, more efficient than ever,  a new kind of vehicular ad hoc networking has emerged with a variety of ITS applications. We envision several applications for the next generation of VANets (NGVNs) that include: urban emergency responses, road safety and security, traffic monitoring, environment-aware, and driving comfort, just to mention a few. However, there are still several open issues that must be resolved before NGVNs are deployed and become a commodity. Secure and reliable service discovery, in particular, is one of the main issues that are delaying the widespread deployment of future application for NGVNs. Service discovery has been widely investigated and several techniques have been proposed for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) that, unfortunately, cannot be directly applied to VANets due to quick changes in link topology, high mobility pattern of vehicles and frequent disconnections among vehicles, especially in low density areas.  In this NSERC SerVANet project, we primarily aim at the development of am efficient,  scalable, low overhead, secure, and fault-tolerant service discovery infrastructure for NGVNs. To this end, we propose a  novel class of service discovery techniques to overcome the challenging issues and critical requirements of NGVN based applications. The outcomes of this project are expected to have a profound impact on how Intelligent Transportation Systems are designed for public safety and security as well as  infotainment class of applications. The proposed service discovery infrastructure will contribute to the development of Canada's key applications of vehicular networks and leverage local knowledge in this area of research. We and our Industry partners believe that this NSERC research proposal is timely and is in sync with the increasing demand for safety of Canadian roads and improving the quality of life for drivers and passengers.

"It is envisioned that the new generation of VANETs will integrate different wireless network technologies such as IEEE 802.11, MESH networks, cellular, WiMax, among others, as well as single-hop and multi-hop communication paradigms. This integration will not only provide vehicle users with seamless mobility and Internet connectivity but will also promote a plethora of new applications for VANETs such as emergency preparedness, multimedia communication, driving assistance, road and traffic condition alerting systems, just to mention a few. However, the high-mobility nature of vehicles in VANETs poses intrinsic research challenges on mobility management for the seamless integration of heterogeneous wireless technologies. Seamless connectivity in heterogeneous VANETs requires novel solutions to handle location management, handoff, service discovery, routing, coverage, and security.



    In this research project, we aim at exploring both the theoretical and practical aspects of mobility management in heterogeneous multi-hop VANETs. We propose to design and evaluate a suite of mobility management protocols to foster the integration of heterogeneous VANETs for seamless connectivity. Last but not least, we will enhance our proposed protocols by including QoS provisioning and guarantees between end-systems, and introduce analytical and simulation models to investigate and obtain crucial performance features of our schemes.



    The proliferation of wireless hot spots and the increasing market growth of low-cost wireless mobile devices are accelerating the development of new markets and companies. Therefore, we believe that research projects that exploit the integration of VANETs and the next generation of heterogeneous wireless infrastructures will have a profound impact on the market.

The main objectives of our program are:  (i) Development of new methods and step-economical strategies for effecting selective organic transformations, and (ii) Total synthesis of structurally novel natural products of biomedical import.  The two areas are inextricably linked, with target-oriented synthesis serving as an unparalleled source of inspiration and as a platform for developing new methods and strategies with broad applications in organic synthesis. 



We specifically seek to develop new methodology based on environmentally benign processes, such as oxidation protocols involving air or simple peroxide reagents, and various cascade reactions that allow a substantial increase in molecular complexity in a single operation. With synthetic directness and maximum efficiency as our goal, we have recently devised new pathways to various classes of oxacyclic structures which are either inaccessible or difficult to make by existing methods.  This proposal outlines our plans to amplify and extend our recent work along with some brand-new projects involving both the development of new synthetic technology and the synthesis of pharmacologically active natural products, such as the potent and selective antitumor acetogenin annomolon A, and a structurally novel antimalarial diterpene peroxide from the Thai cardamom species ""Kra-Waan"".","Produits pharmaceutiques administrables � l'homme","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The ability to organize biological macromolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates and DNA into complex  assemblies is an essential feature of all living organisms. By studying the detailed interactions that promote formation, stability and ultimately function of these complexes, we are able to define a molecular blueprint for an organism's basic biology. Furthermore, the universal requirement for these assemblies often results in information obtained by studying one organism being broadly applicable thereby maximizing knowledge gain. Our collaborative effort outlined in this proposal is focussed on characterizing  specific protein-protein, protein-carbohydrate and protein-DNA macromolecular complexes predicted to serve key cellular functions in development, replication, metabolism and  recognition of pathogens by the immune system. The ultimate goal of this work will be to develop sufficiently detailed molecular models to promote a more in depth understanding of complicated biological systems.

"Aromatic compounds compose approximately 25% of the Earth's biomass and are the second most abundant class of natural products next to carbohydrates. Due to the inherent stability of the aromatic ring, natural attenuation of these compounds is very slow. Many bacteria, however, have evolved biodegradative capabilities that can make use of a wide variety of aromatic compounds as sources of energy. These capabilities have

evolved due to widespread availability of many aromatic compounds in the environment in the form of recycled plant material. Man-made aromatic pollutants, however, pose major challenges for bacterial degradation. Not only are these compounds more chemically complex, but they have only been exposed to

microbial degraders for a relatively short period of time. As a result, these xenobiotic compounds, many of which are derived from crude oil, persist in the environment and cause irreversible damage to the biosphere. A promising strategy to stimulate the removal of these contaminants from the environment is to manipulate the metabolic pathways of bacteria to increase protein stability and broaden substrate specificity. As a prerequisite step to the rationale engineering of these biological systems, detailed descriptions of the enzymes

involved are essential. To this end, the goal of this research program is to define the mechanism by which aromatic compounds are degraded via the novel benzoate oxidation (box) pathways in B. xenovorans LB400. The long-term goal of this research is to design more efficient strategies for the accelerated bioremediation of

environmentally toxic aromatic based pollutants.

"Communications technology is constantly changing the way in which people interact, both for business and personally. With the advent of such technologies as video conferencing, web conferencing and high-speed networks, communicating has taken a huge step forward from email and telephone. It is now possible to communicate via real-time video and audio, bringing a new dimension to the disembodied voice of the telephone. With ever growing improvements to networking technology and increases in processing power and display capability, a new generation of communication tools are just around the corner. Shared virtual environments provide a possible successor for the traditional videoconference. Shared virtual environments attempt to create an immersive, shared, 3D world that connects people across networks and enables them to interact not only with each other, but with various other forms of digital data e.g. 3D models, video, images, text and sounds. The goal of this project is to produce an environment that enables a more realistic, flexible and intuitive way to communicate. To facilitate natural communication, scenes and particularly participants must be represented as realistically as possible. New low cost cameras provide the opportunity to view the real world in a photo-realistic real-time manner, making it an ideal choice for representing scenes and avatars in a shared VE.  Creating or synthesizing in real-time these new views of a scene from a network of cameras is the problem of view synthesis and is one of the main focuses of this research work. In this research project, we will develop novel real-time algorithms to perform view interpolation as well as foreground/background segmentation to separate the participants from their environment. We will also develop new server/client technology capable of dealing with real-life networking problems such as latency and the smart management of

bandwidth.  TRLabs and HP Research are committed to participate to this project by making important technological and monetary contributions.

"Ion channels are transmembrane pores which allow the passage of ions into and out of a cell down the electrochemical gradient. There are hundreds of different ion channels that are regrouped inside protein family and they are distinguished based upon their ion selectivity, gating mechanism, and sequence similarity. One of these families is known as TRPC channels. These channels are very diverse in their physiological function and are activated following a hormonal stimulation, and this thought the animal kingdom. 



To be functional channel, TRPC proteins need to assembly into a tetramer. Also, upon stimulation, each subunit of the tetramer need to move together, resulting to the opening of a small hole in the center of the channel that let the ions pass through. In this research program, we will collect results that will allow us to elucidate how the protein can stay together and how it could move to the close to open states. More precisely, in this proposal, we suggest different ways to investigate the arrangement and structural information of these assembly domains. 



Preliminary results of our laboratory have identified some part of the TRPC proteins that are essential to maintain the four subunits together. Using biochemical techniques, as size exclusion chromatography and sedimentation by sucrose gradient centrifugation, we will determine if one assembly domain is responsible for the tetramerization of the channel or if different regions and contact points are needed. Using also molecular biology techniques, we will identify more precisely which are the group of amino acid and the arrangement between them.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"The origin of the dark matter in our universe is currently one of the most important questions in particle astrophysics.  Our research is targeting a liquid argon detector for dark matter particles with a sensitivity to the WIMP-nucleon cross-section of 10^{-46} cm^2, which is a factor of 500 more sensitive than current experimental limits, and is a factor of ten more sensitive than proposed dark matter searches.



One of the largest challenges in dark matter particle searches is the reduction of background events that could mimic a dark matter particle interaction.  We have constructed a 7 kg liquid argon scintillation detector (DEAP-1) and used it to demonstrate a very high level of background discrimination at low energies. We are currently furthering low-background studies underground with the prototype detector at SNOLAB.



We have used NSERC funds to continue the design and engineering of the large liquid argon detector.  The conceptual detector design is essentially complete and includes a large spherical acrylic vessel viewed by 266 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) through acrylic light guides. The vessel, light guides and PMTs are contained in a spherical stainless steel shell, and the entire detector is submerged in an 8 meter diameter shielding tank to remove external neutrons and gamma rays.  This proposal will allow us to complete the engineering design of the detector, and to begin construction at SNOLAB.



We are currently supporting approximately 20 highly-qualified personnel (HQP) per year (including post-doctoral researchers, research associates, students, and technical and engineering personnel) from NSERC funds.  In addition to fostering research collaborations with international partners, this proposal will lead to further training of HPQ in Canada, with a request of support for 27 researchers.

"Aquaculture now produces all the Atlantic salmon consumed by Canadians and a significant amount for export. However, disease is a major constraint affecting the sustainability and profitability of this industry. Foremost is disease in marine farmed stock. Disease has a direct impact on farm income through inventory losses and an indirect impact by influencing consumer demand. For example, some consumers are reluctant to buy farmed salmon because they believe they would be supporting an industry which is contributing to disease and parasitism in wild salmon stocks. Fortunately the rate of genetic improvement for functional traits such as disease resistance can be greatly improved by using a new method of animal breeding called genomic selection. This technique uses thousands of ""SNP"" genetic markers to determine which of the offspring produced by a disease-resistant family have inherited the disease-resistant alleles. Research using dairy bulls at the University of Guelph has shown that this technique increases the response to selection per generation per dollar spent for traits that can only be measured in the relatives of potential breeders. We are proposing to test whether genomic selection can improve growth rate in saltwater, rapid adaptation to seawater, disease resistance and delay sexual maturity relative to a conventional breeding program currently used at Cooke Aquaculture Inc. in New Brunswick. We anticipate that we accomplish this within a three year period using DNA samples and estimated breeding values (EVB) archived over a four year period from past broodstock and their full sib relatives, as well as the performance of their harvested offspring in seawater farm cages. We can then predict genetic changes in economically important traits that would accrue from the use of genomic selection, and compare this to current selection programs. Disease resistance will be determined by challenge of post smolts in the quarantine lab at

St. Andrews Biological Station.

"One of the significant problems facing the world today is the decay of infrastructure. The cost of protecting and restoring concrete structures worldwide is a large and growing problem (more than $100 billion in annual expenditures). A major component of this decay is the degradation of bridges and highways due to corrosion of the embedded reinforcing steel. This problem has prompted the development of a variety of alternative strategies for increasing the service life of reinforced concrete structures exposed to harsh environments. Among the most well known procedures, one can mention: chemical corrosion inhibitors, protective coatings on steel reinforcement, corrosion-resistant steels (stainless steels, MMFX, etc.), waterproofing membranes or sealants applied to the exposed surface of the concrete, cathodic protection, high performance concrete etc. Each of these alternative technologies has different technical merits and costs associated with their use. An optimum design/repair strategy requires not only an estimate of upfront costs, but also the means to compare all associated costs against the potential extension to the life of the structure. This issue is hardest to answer when considering newly developed materials (such as stainless steels, MMFX, and FRP composites) because of a lack of historical data about their field performance. In such situations, based on first principles, mechanistic approaches have proven to be very powerful tools for making reliable predictions under previously untested conditions. The main objective of the proposed research is to develop sound mechanistic models for reliable service life predictions using advanced theories and experimental techniques, including synchrotron-based testing methods. The presence of the Canadian Light Source (the national synchrotron facility: http://www.lightsource.ca) on the U of S campus provides the opportunity to conduct unprecedented high resolution microscopic analyses of materials. Synchrotron Light covers the full range of the light spectrum; allows greater accuracy and precision than has ever before been possible; and allows matter to be probed in real time under general environmental conditions (moisture, chemical reactions, etc.)

The development of a multicellular organism requires the commitment of individual cells to the appropriate cell fate and then their subsequent differentiation. One of the key pathways involved in specifying cell fates in organisms as diverse as worms to man, is the Notch signaling pathway.  A key component of this pathway is Neuralized, which we identified many years ago.  During the course of our previous NSERC grant, we showed that Neuralized encodes an E3-ubiquitin ligase that targets the Notch ligand, Delta, for ubiquitin-mediated internalization.  This provided the first evidence that intracellular trafficking of its ligands could regulate the Notch pathway.  We also demonstrated that Neuralized binds to phosphoinositides, membrane lipids that mediate membrane trafficking and signaling.  Moreover, we showed that the interaction between Neuralized and phosphoinositides was required for Delta internalization and the initiation of Notch signaling. The goal of the present proposal is to determine if phosphorylation can regulate the interaction of Neuralized with phosphoinositides.  We will also determine if the interaction between Neuralized and phosphoinositides is required for other aspects of Notch signaling. Finally, we will determine how protein-protein interactions affect the ability of Neuralized to bind and endocytose Delta and whether these are required for other developmental processes. These studies will help us to elucidate the function of Neuralized in cell fate decisions and its relationship to known signaling pathways important in regulating cell-cell interactions during development.  Since Neuralized and the Notch pathway are highly conserved, understanding the function of these genes in Drosophila will also shed light onto ways that cell fates are acquired in most multicellular organisms.  Finally, understanding the mechanisms regulating cell-cell interactions in development may provide insights into defects in cell fate decisions and in cell-cell signaling associated with human diseases such as cancer.

"Wireless communications have been among the fastest-growing technologies in human history with relentless emergence of new sophisticated standards to satisfy the demands for faster data rates of the increasingly hyperconnected world. However, each time a new standard emerges, carriers are forced to build a new dedicated network with considerable cost of ownership. Hence, wireless communications are experiencing an extreme shortening of standards lifecycle and intensification in investment risks. This project aims at the application of the leading edge technology of Software Defined Radios (SDR) for the investigation of new generation of flexible and reconfigurable wireless base stations capable of (i) operating over a wide range of frequency bands, and (ii) transmitting or receiving signals according to dissimilar standards. This new generation of multiband and multi-standard SDR base stations will enable a more unified wireless infrastructure that features an improved integrity, extended networks lifespan and low investments risks. It will also lead to more efficient network utilization by employing intelligent dynamic spectrum allocation. This project will focus on the development of novel multiband and multicarrier (MBMC) transmitters which represent the most challenging design criteria in the successful realization of SDR base stations. Therefore, the first step of the research will be geared towards finding a common innovative MBMC transmitter architecture. The project will also investigate a systematic approach for the design of multiband matching networks and impedance transformers. These will later be applied in the design of MBMC class-AB power amplifiers (PA) using GaN transistor technology. Subsequently, the successful realization of the MBMC class-AB PAs will trigger a more exciting and challenging objective aiming at the development of MBMC Doherty amplifier to improve the efficiency of the SDR base stations. In addition, sources of distortions exhibited by the MBMC transmitters will be analyzed in order to develop novel physical driven behavioural models and predistortion based linearizers in order to meet the stringent linearity requirements imposed by the wireless standards.","Technologie des t�l�communications (satellites, radar,etc.)","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Communications and Information B",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario

"The middle atmosphere is a region of the atmosphere extending from about 10 km altitude up to near the edge of space (about 85 km altitude).  The stratosphere, which is the lowest part of the middle atmosphere, has become an important area of research because changes in the nature of the stratosphere are coupled to changes at the Earth's surface that effect our daily lives.   We will study satellite measurements of the atmosphere to investigate the processes and trends that take place in the stratosphere.  In particular, we will use measurements from the Canadian OSIRIS satellite instrument.  These measurements, which essentially cover the globe every day, can be used to detect the amount and vertical structure of ozone, clouds, and aerosols, which in this context may be small liquid droplets or particles of dust, smoke or ice.  

     Satellite measurements over the past few years suggest that a decrease in the rate of ozone depletion in the stratosphere is underway.  We will work to improve and investigate the OSIRIS measurements of ozone so that we can use them to contribute to the understanding of the observed changes in the ozone layer. We will also use satellite measurements to detect and track aerosols that are injected high up into the atmosphere by volcanic eruptions and also by intense forest fires, such as those in Northern Saskatchewan.  At high altitudes, these aerosols can persist for a long time and affect the transmission of sunlight through the atmosphere.  Eventually these aerosols are transported by atmospheric circulation to Arctic latitudes where they may have an important effect on the changing climate.  This study will help to improve our understanding of these processes. 

     We will use our experience with these measurements to begin the development of the next generation of satellite instrumentation for remote sensing the middle atmosphere. This will continue Canada's successful history of space based science and continue Canada's contribution to these important observations of our planet.

"Our laboratory is interested in the regulation and functional role of a unique family of fungal enzymes, collectively known as 'yapsins', in the assembly of the yeast cell wall. This structure is highly complex and essential for the viability of all fungi, including human opportunist pathogens such as C. albicans. The first member of this family is the Yps1 enzyme that we, and others, identified in the brewer yeast S. cerevisiae a decade ago. We now know that five members of theses enzymes are expressed in S. cerevisiae, all of them are localized at the cell surface. Recent studies suggested that these enzymes were implicated in some aspects of cell wall assembly, but until recently, no substrate for any of these enzymes had been identified. We recently identified some natural substrates for Yps1 in S. cerevisiae and the nature of these substrates clearly confirmed that Yps1 participate in the cell wall assembly. Our recent study also suggested that: 1) during their intracellular transport to reach the cell surface, these enzymes are kept apart from most other proteins destined for secretion; and 2) the environmental pH regulates the activity of this enzyme. In the current proposal we have designed experiments to: 1) identify additional Yps1 substrates; 2) confirm and understand the significance of the particular intracellular transport that this enzyme is taking; and 3) understand what controls the activity of this enzyme. In addition to deepen our understanding on how fungal yapsins regulate cell wall assembly in yeast, the proposed studies should help designing specific inhibitors that may lead to the development of novel antifungal agents.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The mean spatio-temporal variability in flow, temperature, salinity, nutrients, sediments, oxygen etc., in coastal seas is largely determined by small-scale fluctuating turbulent processes. It is qualitatively understood that in these environments  turbulence can be induced by tidal currents, wind, surface and internal wave breaking and current shear. However, the quantitative picture of how turbulent fluctuations are being produced and how the energy is dissipated is fundamentally not well undertstood. This lack of understading and predictability of small-scale processes limits our skills in simulating and predicting the mean state of coastal oceans.



The goal of this research is to develop new theories and models of ocean turbulence and to tests them against field measurements. This will be done by carrying out computer simulations of coastal flows and by deploying  in the ocean state-of-the-art instrumentation to measure turbulent properties. In the long run, the hope is that the results of this research will help to foresee more accurately the state of Canada's coastal ocean and the dynamics of its marine ecosystem. A better understanding of coastal zones will help manage fish resources and the impact and adaptability to climate change scenarios.

"Numerical simulations are becoming an increasingly important tool in the analysis of physiological systems and pathologies, and the development of biomedical treatment. Techniques and models from continuum mechanics and that were part of traditional engineering are now progressively introduced in medicine, often requiring the development of new simulation methods given the relative complexity of living systems. The current proposal works precisely along this objective of developing models and numerical techniques that apply to two biomedical fields, namely to physiological flows and to cardiac electrophysiology. By physiological flows, we mean blood flows but also flows and aerosol propagation in airways, linking to our previous work in these two areas. A commonality of problems in these fields, i.e. phenomena with several spatial and temporal scales modelled with time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations, requires a commonality of simulation methods, i.e. adaptative numerical methods with a controlled level of error in space and time. Our research program concentrates on the development of such numerical methods but also includes modelling aspects, in particular for improving our current Eulerian aerosol model. The proposed research program will eventually lead to integrated analysis tools for the process from medical image segmentation => patient-specific geometry => physical model => numerical simulations  => visualization.



Specific objectives of the research program are:



1) To develop adaptative numerical methods in space and time;

2) To improve computational models for physiological flows;

3) To improve computational models in cardiac electrophysiology.

"Mathematical models and computer simulations provide powerful tools to investigate the complex fluid flow patterns seen in nature and in technological applications. This proposal focuses on flames, forest fires, explosions, and droplets. A better understanding of those phenomena will ultimately help design more efficient engines, better manage forests and fire risks, design safer ways of dealing with potentially explosive processes, and suggest novel ways of manipulating fluid mixtures at very small scales. Those problems are difficult research questions. First, the mathematical models are difficult, non-linear, multi-dimensional, partial differential equations, whose solutions are not known explicitly, and can exhibit severe nonlinearities and discontinuities. Second, all those phenomena have in common two features that each constitute a challenging research topic: the flows are intrinsically multiscale - the small details of the flows have an important influence on the global behavior - and the flows exhibit sharp fronts, such as the flame front or the interface between the fluid inside the droplet and the air surrounding it. Novel modeling strategies, combined with state-of-the-art numerical methods, high performance computers and feedback from detailed experimentations open new avenues to try to tackle those questions.

"The proposed work involves the development of a landscape-level model of forest growth by extending an existing 10 parameter net ecosystem productivity (NEP) model to the landscape by linking the model's monthly growth projections to local biophysical conditions. These conditions are to be derived by combining remote sensing-based images of temperature and leaf area with landscape-level simulations of solar radiation and soil water content.  Forest ecosystem characterisation and NEP model parameter setting are to be based on information collected by a stationary base station and roving tower system. The 37-m stationary tower will provide long term base weather and ecological data. This information along with NEP and weather data collected at forest sites with a roving tower will be used to (1) derive the required forest-specific growth parameters for different forest cover, and (2) extend 2-3 week-long time series of NEP for application at the landscape level. Linking point-measurements of NEP to forest growth is innovative; however, the proposed project takes this work a step further by applying the calculations to a modelled forest landscape at spatial scales appropriate for forest management planning.

"With the rising scale and complexity of networks and services, there is a pressing need for scalable, efficient, and reliable management solutions.  Autonomic management is envisioned to be the ultimate solution.  In working towards this goal, my previous research on self-management has revealed a number of fundamental issues.  First, current management systems collect only rudimentary data about network devices and flows, reporting only a few basic quality-of-service metrics. There is little information processing, or correlation among the metrics. The lack of comprehensive knowledge support and formal treatment of knowledge generation impedes the effectiveness of many network and service operations.  Second, the diverse distributed applications (e.g. P2P, overlay networks, tube streaming, social networks) supported by today's Internet can interfere with vital network planning and engineering operations, such as inter-domain routing and traffic engineering.  There is an inability to consolidate network and service operations, as little is understood about their interactions, resulting in critical management issues, including stability and optimality.  Third, malfunctions and misconfiguration caused by today's manual (and in the future by automated) configuration and administration of networks is a primary source of service disruption, and creates susceptibility to malicious attacks.  A strong sense of reliability must be introduced into the design and development of the entire management system.  This includes the use of formal methodologies, for verification and evaluation of the system during design and at runtime, as well as the application of self-stabilization and fault tolerance to maintain correct operation in adversarial environments.

     )	This research draws on our extensive experience in automated network management and autonomics research to address these critical issues.  By seeking effective and practical solutions, this work will have both immediate and far reaching impact on the management of networks, by advancing the state-of-the-art in order to enable autonomic management.

"The assessment of user preferences is critical to the development of decision support and interactive optimization tools The ability to customize decisions to the needs or desires of specific users or organizations is of great interest in a wide range of domains, including medical decision making, financial planning, procurement and supply chain management, product recommendation, personalized Web search, advertizing, user interface configuration, and many others.  Making good or optimal decisions requires that a system know enough about a user's preferences (or utility function) to address the task at hand, and have the ability to trade off the costs of obtaining such preference information with the value of that information (i.e., its ability to improve decision quality).  



The proposed research will develop new techniques for preference assessment and elicitation, both in single-agent and multiagent (or economic) contexts. The underlying methodology embodies assessment techniques that allow decisions to be made with only partial preference information, and elicitation techniques that obtain the most relevant information. Building on previous work using Bayesian and regret-based optimization and elicitation, we will explore two key themes that challenge current techniques. One is the assessment of preferences in sequential decision problems (such as Markov decision problems). Indirect (observational) and direct (querying) partial assessment methods will be developed, as will online methods that must act in the presence of an uncertain future (this is of special importance to online mechanism design). The second theme is the development of ""open-ended"" assessment and elicitation techniques, wherein the attributes or outcomes of interest are ill-specified or entirely unknown to the system. Feature identification/construction methods for utility functions will be developed as will techniques for handling vague features in multiattribute utility models.",Logiciel,"Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computing and Information Sciences - B",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Many ecosystems are impacted by anthropogenic factors, including the use of pesticides. In agro-ecosystems croplands and natural habitats are intermingled and for that reason native species are more at risk. Toxicity effects of pesticides on plants and other organisms are usually assessed using single-species tests under artificial conditions and measure direct toxicity on growth and survival. These simple tests are important to identify impacts on individual organisms, but alone they preclude an assessment of indirect pesticide effects on organisms embedded in their natural environments. Biological interactions, and effects of spatial (land use, surrounding landscape) and temporal (recent and past disturbance) factors are not considered which leads to minimal ecological realism. In this research program, we will investigate the ecological relevance in risk assessment in 4 major projects: 1) We will study the role of herbicides in shaping the community structure of a riparian community system, taking into consideration past and current conditions at the local and regional levels. Field work in pristine and impacted areas will be used to generate testable hypothesis using systems with a lower level of complexity (e.g. microcosms); 2) The role of invasive species is neglected in risk assessment. We will study the effect of Phalaris arundinacea on the native community under different regime of agro-chemical use; 3) A multi-trophic approach will be used to model the direct and indirect effects of fungicides on a community structure. A 3-way system using vascular plants, their associated mycorrhizae, and also fungus-eating Collembola will serve to demonstrate the different levels of interactions when the fungicide is applied; 4) A more conceptual approach will be used to test the vulnerability of plant species to herbicides, using pertinent ecological and morphological plant characteristics. Results of these studies will bring new insights into the impact of pesticides (herbicides and fungicides) within natural contexts. The work will increase our knowledge of the multiple factors that explain habitat quality as determined by plant diversity and composition, and it will link phytotoxicity testing with actual risk posed by pesticides to organisms in the field.","Conservation et pr�servation",Environnement,"Evolution & Ecology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Canada's boreal forest, like many parts of the world, is undergoing unprecedented change due to aggressive human landuse and climate change.  The challenge for ecologists is to understand how this will affect the organisms living there and from this, provide society with answers to the question of what ecosystems will look like in the future.  This requires that we unravel the mechanisms whereby environmental change affects plastic responses of individuals, genotype frequency through natural selection, and population dynamics through changes in age-specific life history patterns.  To do so, we must characterize the nature of individual variation (phenotypic or genotypic), how this variation relates to fitness, and most importantly, how important ecological variables (abiotic and biotic) drive these changes.  This is a formidable task but it is possible to make significant advances by carefully selecting an appropriate experimental system and conducting long-term studies of individuals in the wild.  

 

My students and I have used North American red squirrels as a model organism for study. These small mammals have characteristics that allow us to follow individuals from birth to death. We are particularly interested in how variation in food supply (conifer seed) affects reproductive behaviours such as timing of breeding, juvenile growth rates, litter size, and age at first reproduction. We have discovered that climate change in the north has advanced timing of breeding by 18 days in the past 10 years. We will investigate how energy expenditure varies with food supply and how this may relate to reproductive strategies and their evolution under changing environmental conditions.","Gestion de la faune",Environnement,"Northern Research Supplement Program",2,"RGPNS ","Discovery Grants Program - Northern Research Supplement",Alberta,Alberta

"When we walk, we do not have to think about the detailed movements that our legs are making. All we have to worry about is where we want to go and how fast. It can be so because part of our nervous system that operates autonomously generates the detailed walking movement for us. Such a movement controller is fast and efficient in every day life, as it reduces the amount of attention we have to dedicate to walking.

However, when walking movements have to be changed, such as after disease, injury or new environmental needs (for example walking on a boat or, in the future, on Mars), we can't always adapt to the new situation. Sometimes training will help, and sometimes it is inefficient. To adapt, the nervous system must reorganize the way it commands muscles during walking, a phenomenon called locomotor plasticity. At the moment, we have no way to predict when plasticity will occur or not. Understanding how locomotor plasticity occurs is extremely important if we want one day to be able to train effectively astronauts to walk safely on Mars, and people with walking problems to recover their mobility.

The present research program proposes an original way to study locomotor plasticity. Using a simple and effective means (walking with an external force applied to the leg by a robotic boot), we can reproduce in the laboratory all the conditions required to adapt walking. Combining this method of adaptation to modern kinematic and neurophysiological testing, we will, over the next 5 years, address 3 fundamental questions on how the nervous system is reorganized during adaptation: 1) how is the nervous system changed during adaptation? 2) what are the important feedback signals needed to adapt? and 3) if training is provided, what are the long-term effects on the nervous system? 

This is an important research program that opens the study of mechanisms of locomotor plasticity, an aspect of locomotion that is poorly understood at the moment. Results obtained here will have a major impact both in basic science and health applications.

"The role of cells is central to the progression of adverse events for nearly every disease. An understanding of migration patterns for cells of the body's immune system over time, or in response to treatment, is critical to discovering the physiological processes responsible. Methods that non-invasively obtain information about cellular migration patterns would greatly benefit diagnostic assessment of newly developed cellular therapy strategies proposed for the treatment of heart disease and stroke.



Current techniques for observing cell behavior are invasive, and so interfere with normal biological activity and cannot be repeated frequently over time. The research being proposed here would allow for the development of MRI techniques to non-invasively map the migration patterns of cells of interest by labeling them with tiny quantities of iron-oxide. By creating a tool to monitor cell homing in a quantitative way, as proposed in this research, basic understanding of cell-biology processes in inflammation research and new therapies in regenerative medicine may be developed.

"The long-term objective of my research is to understand the evolutionary and ecological factors that have shaped the foraging and reproductive strategies of pinnipeds. We have demonstrated broad differences in the ecology of adult male and female grey seals. Because many marine mammals and seabirds express size dimorphism similar to grey seals, the kind of sex-specific differences we have found in grey seals may be common. We have also demonstrated pronounced age-related differences in reproductive performance of female grey seals, including strong evidence of senescence. During the next five years, my students and I plan to study sources of variability in reproductive performance within and among grey seal females over time. We also plan to test hypotheses about the behavioural and physiological mechanisms that underlie the decline in reproductive performance of older females (i.e., those >30 yr old). Offspring size is often used as a proxy for female and offspring fitness in large mammals, but this hypothesis has rarely been tested in marine carnivores. We have data on size at weaning for samples of five cohorts and will use size and age at recruitment, early reproductive success. There is evidence that considerable individual variation in diet  is obscured by averaging across individuals. We will use fatty acid signature analysis to examine the relative importance of within vs. among individual variation in diet and thus to better understand these components of dietary niche width. Finally I plan to investigate the ontogeny of foraging behaviour in grey seals using models fit to Argos satellite locations data. The results of this research have implications for the conservation and management of pinnipeds and for our understanding of the importance of top-down effects of large marine carnivores on ecosystem structure and functioning.

"Nanoscale systems exhibit a rich variety of structures, quantum effects and phase transitions as a result of two primary effects: the increased importance of surface phenomena and the influence of fluctuations. We plan to develop  computer simulation techniques and thermodynamic models that explicitly account for these features, then apply them to the study of phase transformations in nanosystems such as the freezing and melting of nanoparticles, the deliquescence of small atmospheric aerosols and capillarity condensation and cavitation in nanopores.     )	

    )	

As nanoscale systems become increasingly important in a variety of fields, including chemistry, physics, engineering, biology and atmospheric science, it is essential that we develop rigorous thermodynamic and statistical tools to study them. Consequently, the fundamental aspects of this research will have wide-ranging implications for nanoscience and nanotechnology in general. The specific projects involving surface effects will also have an impact on their respective fields. For example, if surface induced nucleation of crystals in small droplets is the dominant mechanism for crystallisation, then enormous variations in atmospheric nucleation rates can occur, depending on the size distribution of droplets. Furthermore, the persistence of surface nucleation may offer the possibility of controlling and directing the final structure of crystalline nanoparticles  through the use of surfactant-like molecules that alter the surface properties of the particle, enhancing our ability to build nanostructures.","Sciences physiques","Avancement des connaissances","Anal. & Phys.

"Decision making in multiagent environments is a critical challenge for deploying artificially intelligent agents in real-world settings. Applications involving or requiring interaction between independent agents -- human, robotic, or software -- are rapidly increasing.  The rise of inexpensive robot platforms and the pervasiveness of distributed agents make the assumption of isolated decision making less justifiable.  Agent modelling is a key component for coping with the presence of other decision makers.  Applications as diverse as assistive technologies, autonomous driving, electronic commerce, and interactive entertainment all require or could benefit significantly from accurate models of other agents (artificial or human).



One approach to constructing such agent models is to consult domain experts and build generic, knowledge-intensive models of the typical human or artificial agent.  The use of these entirely generic models, though, prevents tailoring the interaction to the particular participants.  In addition, many tasks require models that are not easily elicited from a domain expert due to domain complexity and the difficulty in codifying expert intuitions.



This research examines a data-driven, statistical approach to agent modelling.  In particular, it focuses on the development of techniques for constructing statistical agent models from large datasets of previous interactions, both of the agent being modelled and past agents.  In the same way that large corpuses of written text transformed the practice of natural language processing, it is expected that a similar statistical approach can overcome the significant limitations of knowledge-based agent models.

"The understanding of fully developed turbulence remains an elusive challenge to researchers in science and engineering.  Although the Navier-Stokes equation provides an accurate description of typical fluids, when it becomes chaotic at high speeds, our understanding is rudimentary. Indeed, substantial progress towards understanding this equation and its solutions constitutes one of the seven millennium challenges proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute.  Even approximate solutions of the problem defy modern computers, which lack the storage and speed necessary to accurately simulate turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere or around a moving body.  Subgrid models are often used to allow a simulation on today's computer to mimic computations that will very likely not be directly possible even on the computers of the next century. However, most of the subgrid models used in practice are ad hoc devices that remove energy from the system at the smallest scales retained in the simulation.  However, for a subgrid model to be faithful to the underlying physics, it must also inject energy at other scales, to describe the beating of small-scale waves.  This important effect is neglected by many subgrid models in use today.  The goal of this project is to develop reliable subgrid models for the next generation of turbulence simulations, based on a technique known as spectral reduction, which allows one to accurately estimate velocities at scales that are not directly retained in the simulation.  Recently, a practical computational technique for applying spectral reduction to a one-dimensional analogue of the Navier-Stokes equation (with which it shares many properties) was developed in a master's thesis.  The method is an attempt to numerically approximate the solution using several grids of variable resolution. The communication of data between the grids is designed to conserve energy.  The generalization of the method to the full Navier-Stokes equation would lead to a dynamical subgrid model for high-Reynolds number turbulence that has a physical basis and is free of arbitrary parametrization. Such a subgrid model would greatly reduce the computational cost of simulations of turbulent drag and transport.

"Arsenic contamination of drinking water is a global problem causing chronic health problems in affected populations. Symptoms range from skin discolouration, nausea, diarrhoea and vascular problems to cancer. In countries such as Bangladesh it is estimated that over 30 million people are exposed to high levels of arsenic, and localised areas with high arsenic levels have been found in Canada, the USA and throughout the world. Methods have been developed to remove arsenic-containing compounds from drinking water supplies, but these are limited by cost especially in developing countries.

  Bacteria have been identified which use arsenic-containing compounds as an energy source. These arsenic degrading bacteria are known to play a role in the mobilisation of arsenic in the environment. Bacteria have also been tested in strategies to convert arsenic containing compounds into less soluble forms, facilitating their removal from drinking water supplies. However, the genes and pathways involved are not well understood - some of the genes involved in oxidation or reduction of arsenic containing compounds have been identified, but much work remains to be done. Recently, the DNA sequence for several of these bacteria has been determined. The information from these genomes could allow the identification of new genes involved in arsenic metabolism. This study will use the genomic sequence information as a starting point for developing new strategies to identify bacteria involved in arsenic cycling within the environment. We will look for genes and microbes that can act as markers for arsenic-contamination. The methods employed will involve sequencing DNA isolated directly from environments known to have high levels of arsenic, such as contaminated wells, or areas downstream from mining operations. This information will be used to develop high-throughput diagnostic tools for use in the study of regions contaminated with arsenic. Tools and methods developed through this initiative could potentially be applied in the analysis of other environmental contaminants.

"Competing successfully in today's competitive business world poses significant challenges to Canadian firms. There is a need to constantly deliver new products or to tailor existing products to different customer needs, carefully price them, and adapt these decisions to the changing market. Survival and growth in this environment depend on how well firms manage customer demand for their products and execute supply decisions to match the demand in a dynamic fashion. Lack of systems and organizational silos have been blamed for the lack of coordination between demand and supply management. Today, new technology and the Internet provide firms with accurate customer demand information, improve visibility across functions and over time, and reduce transaction costs. These open the door for firms to adopt new selling strategies, implement intelligent dynamic pricing schemes, and to integrate them with inventory decisions. Our objective in this research program is to develop integrated operations-marketing models that exploit this opportunity for a variety of market scenarios. 



In the first phase of our research program we will examine optimal (joint) dynamic pricing and inventory management of innovative products (e.g., fashion apparel). We will particularly concentrate our attention to novel selling strategies that make use of continent pricing schemes. These include price guarantees, advance selling, contingent discounting and selling with satisfaction guarantees. In the second phase of our research program, we plan to examine the optimal (joint) dynamic pricing and inventory management of functional products (e.g., basic apparel). We will specifically consider the effects of promotions, in terms of depth, length as well as frequency. We believe that the insights generated from our research will help Canadian firms to trade-off the demand enhancing consequences of pricing with associated operational costs, and thereby improve their global competitiveness.

"The remediation of contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes is recognized by Canadian and US regulatory agencies as an urgent environmental priority. 42 Areas of Concern (AOC's) have been identified where lake-bottom sediments are contaminated to toxic levels by heavy metals, hydrocarbons and a range of other environmental pollutants. Once buried in sediments, these contaminants can persist for many decades and pose a serious long-term threat to human health and aquatic ecosystems. McMaster researcher Boyce and his graduate students are assisting in remediation efforts by developing new methods for mapping contaminated sediments based on their magnetic properties. Their preliminary work in Lake Ontario has shown that toxic sediments are often more highly magnetized than clean sediments and can be identified and mapped by towing a magnetic sensing device called a magnetometer above the lakebed. Measurement of the magnetization of sediment core samples can also provide rapid 'proxy' measurements of pollutant levels without the need for expensive and time-consuming chemical testing. Further work is now required to develop magnetic methods for pollution monitoring. With NSERC's support, Boyce and his team plan to investigate how magnetic particles and contaminants are transported into lake basins and to develop new methods for 'magnetic finger-printing' of pollution sources. The research will lead to a more rapid and effective approach for mapping contaminants in lakes and will accelerate ongoing international efforts to remediate sediments in several heavily polluted AOC's within the Great Lakes.

"Humans are causing vast changes to the ecology of our planet. Climates are becoming warmer and more variable, and increasingly landscapes are being disturbed and fragmented altering species distributions.  My research seeks to explain the ecological consequences of increasing temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity to selected wildlife species, embracing new methods for study of stochastic demography, movement dynamics, changing distributions, and population dynamics.  Some of these quantitative tools have conservation applications, e.g., movement models such as step-selection functions can help us to identify corridors for movement of animals between areas of habitat.

     I propose 3 projects that explore consequences of changing temporal and spatial variation.  First, seasonality might be the driver that maintains 10-year periodicity in lynx and other furbearers, but these cycles appear to be breaking down in the southern boreal possibly due to changing seasonality associated with climate change.  Alternatively, loss of periodic dispersal due to habitat loss and fragmentation might be causing deteriorating cycles in southern Canada and threatened-species status of lynx in the USA.  

     A second study attempts to explain synchronous declines in fur returns of muskrat and mink in eastern Canada.  We postulate that dynamics reflect a predator-prey interaction in western Canada, whereas periodic declines in muskrat and mink are driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation in eastern Canada.  

     A third study attempts to sort out the role of climate change and industrial development in the global decline in caribou and reindeer.  For southern populations, landscape disturbances reduce the seral stage of vegetation, increasing deer and moose populations.  This increase in prey increases wolf numbers and wolf predation on caribou, i.e., apparent competition.  Climate change is most severe in the Arctic which is resulting in rapid declines of many of the world's herds of caribou and reindeer due to thawing and freezing limiting access to forage, and the trophic mismatch caused by earlier onset of green up.

"Industrial development for oil and gas extraction, mining, and timber harvest has resulted in extensive road construction in western Alberta.  Roads and human use of roads is known to influence the distribution, movement, and mortality of sensitive wildlife species including elk, wolves, and grizzly bears.  Gated management of recreational access to roads has been proposed to mitigate the effects of industrial development on indigenous wildlife.  We propose an experimental study to evaluate the effectiveness of gated access management of roads on wildlife on the east slopes of SW Alberta.  We will use a repeated before-after-control-intervention (BACI) study design and global positioning system (GPS) radiotelemetry to monitor movements, habitat use, and mortality of elk, wolves, and grizzly bears.  We will use newly developed statistical methods in a GIS to map the influences of access management on the distribution and movement of wildlife, and to identify localities that should be managed as movement corridors.  We will evaluate the relations between habitat selection and components of fitness and how these are modified by roads and access management.   We will develop spatially structured predator-prey models (elk/wolves & bears) that allow us to identify the effect of roads and access management on predator-prey interactions.  Our research will evaluate cost-effective methods that can allow persistence of sensitive wildlife in the face of industrial development.

"The de la Concorde bridge collapse in Laval, Quebec has focused attention across the country and internationally on the deterioration of concrete bridge structures and emphasizes the need for improved evaluation methods and more effective performance specifications in the design of new structures. 

 

The proposed research program is aimed at improving the durability, service life, and ultimately safety of the nation's concrete transportation infrastructure through the development of performance specifications related to the flow properties of the concrete. These specifications will be based upon material characteristics and test methods that more accurately reflect the behaviour of concrete in severe environments. Such a research program will greatly improve the performance of our concrete structures, while also producing the highly qualified personnel essential to this emerging field.","Construction, urbanisme et am�nagement rural","Construction, urbanisme et am�nagement rural","Civil Engineering",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Throughout history, technology and art have provided each other with mutual inspiration. Technological advances inspire artists with new tools, while art challenges the way we view the world, suggesting new directions for technological development.  This project will develop technology in computer vision for interaction in modern installation art.  The methodology focuses on production of interactive art installations that also serves as experimental platforms for evaluating the underlying computer vision systems.  Risks in the project include the possibility that artistic applications may not demand sufficient innovation to provoke technological advancement, or conversely, that a focus on technology will diminish the quality of art produced.  To address these risks, I will



  1.    )	use rigorous experimentation with human subjects to validate the effectiveness of the vision technology,

  2.    )	explore a broad range of formal artistic elements that will push the vision technology, and

  3.    )	continue to collaborate with artists to ensure the quality of art produced.



Our objectives include extending our successes in developing novel computer vision systems for interaction, more interactive art installations, and expanding artistic breadth to include sound and music.  Beyond the immediate significance of contributions to visual interaction and art, we hope that collaboration with the arts will provide foresight that would not otherwise be available.

"The primary objective of our research is to use contemporary computational chemistry methods to study the properties and reactions of important molecules.  We choose problems for which computational studies complement experimental studies and for which there is a significant probability that important insight into fundamental processes will be gained through our research.  Our studies frequently lead to new interpretations of experimental results and subsequently to the proposal of new mechanisms for molecular processes. 



Contemporary methods are especially useful for the study of biological systems for which there is often little information on the identity of the key species and even less on the mechanisms by which they affect the physiology of living systems. Our research has important implications for many public health concerns, including the consequences of radiation damage to biological material, both through inadvertent exposure to radiation and through radiation therapy.  



Nature mediates almost all biological reactions by means of enzymes, which function as catalysts.  Enzymes provide pathways that lower the activation energy and thereby allow a reaction to occur more quickly.  Computational methods provide detailed information about the energies and geometries of the transition states of reactions that cannot be obtained by even the most sophisticated experimental techniques. We are using state-of-the-art computational methods to explain biological phenomena at the molecular level and to investigate several classes of enzymatic reactions as part of a plan to develop theoretical models for biological catalysis.

"The long-term goal of this research is to develop methods for non-invasive assessment of bone quality and strength in patients suffering from bone and joint diseases. The core of this proposal involves the development of state-of-the-art finite element simulation methods.  The method will take non-invasively acquired medical imaging data sets (i.e., computed tomography) for input to automatically generated finite element models to predict bone mechanics and assess bone strength and failure.



This research proposal includes computational developments and is validated based on novel experimental data. Using a method called image guided failure assessment, bones will be mechanically tested inside the micro-computed tomography (�CT) scanner to obtain 3D visualizations of the progression of damage to the structure as loading is increased. Simultaneously, force-displacement data will provide information to establish our computational approach. The finite element model will be developed for non-linear analysis of bone mechanics based on patient-specific �CT data, and appropriate failure criteria and methodologies to define the bone elastic properties will be validated against the experimental data. The advances in the finite element simulation approach will be coupled with work to increase computational efficiency of these calculations so that it is feasible to apply the method without the need of super-computing facilities.



This project will combine �CT data that can be collected in vivo in both animals and humans with finite element simulation to determine strength. Strength is a critical determinant of fracture risk in bone diseases such as osteoporosis, and this work will develop an approach to estimate strength in patients at the distal radius and tibia based on their 3D micro-structure. This is the first time such a direct method to assess bone strength has been applied, and represents an important advance in the monitoring and treatment of osteoporosis.

"Many practically important problems are combinatorial in nature.  Some examples of such problems include the design of reliable communication networks, fast printed circuit board production, scheduling problems and routing problems.  Many such problems are known to belong to a class called ""NP-hard"", which is strong evidence that these problems are extremely difficult to solve, and that it is unlikely that efficient techniques for finding the optimal (i.e. the best) solution exist.  The lack of efficient methods for such problems is of real importance as there exist large scale, real world instances requiring solutions.  Fortunately, in practice, it is often satisfactory to obtain solutions for these problems which, if not optimal, are at least guaranteed to lie within a certain satisfactory percentage of the optimal solution.



Our research objective is to enlarge the set of such problems which can be practically and satisfactorily solved.  To achieve this objective we will use the following three approaches:



1)  Investigate using closely-related relaxations of a problem to develop new, efficient methods which provide solutions which are guaranteed to lie within a satisfactory percentage of the optimal solution.



2)  Exploit the underlying combintorial structure of a problem to provide the necessary tools for improved problem-specific implicit enumeration schemes for certain problems of interest.



3)  Investigate constructing and applying combinatorial optimization models for applications arising in other areas of computer science.

"My research efforts for the next five years will focus on a series of related projects concerned with the topology of 3-dimensional manifolds. Many of the basic problems in this field can be analysed in terms of the Dehn filling operation. One of the main goals of my proposal is to contribute to our understanding of this operation and to apply this work to study open problems such as the exceptional filling conjecture and the generalised knot complement conjecture.  Another one of my goals is to investigate the qualitative behaviour of infinite families of non-zero degree maps between 3-dimensional manifolds. In particular, I am interested in topologising the situation so as to determine precompactness conditions for such families and to understand the topological implications of divergence. 



A major line of contemporary research in 3-manifold theory concerns their virtual properties. These are properties which hold up to taking a finite degree cover. I will investigate various problems of this nature including the virtual Haken conjecture, the virtual fibring conjecture, and the virtual bi-orderability conjecture. 



Much of my work in 3-manifold topology depends on results regarding the geometric representation theory of their fundamental groups. I intend to continue working in this area, which will be useful not only for studying the problems discussed in this proposal, but also for opening up new areas of application as well.



Finally, I will investigate various questions concerning 3-dimensional Poincar� duality groups (PD(3) groups) such as whether every finitely presented PD(3) group is the fundamental group of a 3-manifold. In particular I am interested in the linearity of such groups.

"This project covers three topics in insurance  and finance. 

The first topic deals with structured retail investment products.   There is a rich variety of tailored investment products available to the retail  investor in every developed economy.  These contracts combine upside participation in good equity markets with downside protection in poor  markets. Examples include  equity linked contracts sold by insurance companies and  structured products marketed by banks. These products are popular with retail  investors and have sometimes very complicated payoffs. We design a powerful general procedure for analyzing the efficiency of these contracts. This method permits us to calibrate a given contract in terms of its cost efficiency.  The approach also  enables us  to determine the exact  design of the most  efficient contract.  This research should be of interest to investors and regulators. 



 The second topic deals with portfolio selection.   Most popular  models  of portfolio selection assume that the  investor has detailed knowledge of the  distribution of portfolio  returns. The optimal portfolio weights are very sensitive to the input  assumptions.  We  analyze methods which are robust to variations  in the input assumptions. 



Our third topic deals  with  the issue of systemic risk and examines  how  to develop better risk management systems for  financial   institutions. Robert Shiller (2008) has pointed out the balance sheets of individuals, corporations, and governments are all

interconnected through international financial markets. It is clear that risk   management  models need to be refashioned to better account for this  interdependence and the contagion in financial markets. This is a topic of great current interest given the recent failures of many  large banks.

"The availability of sequenced genomes and metabolite profiling technologies offer scientists the required tools to investigate secondary metabolism in plants. In plants, flavonoid accumulation is regulated by developmental and environmental stress factors.  In many plants, flavonol glycoside conjugates accumulate as major end products and storage pools of flavonoid biosynthesis.  Interestingly, the deconjugated flavonol aglycone pool is increased during physiologically determined processes in plants. Although, there are numerous studies describing the genes and enzymes promoting flavonol biosynthesis, very little information exists on the biochemical processes that govern flavonol deglycosylation and turnover.  Over the past few decades, there is mounting evidence that glycosyl hydrolases mediate the liberation of bioactive aglycones from glycoside conjugated flavonoids.  Arabidopsis thaliana has become a model for flavonoid biochemistry and genetics. We will analyze and describe the mechanisms involved in the conversion of flavonol glycoside to aglycone pools during plant development and environmental stress acclimation.

    )	Specifically, we will analyze the flavonol glucoside and rhamnoside turnover processes. Further, we will characterize and clone  flavonol deglycosylation enzymes in Arabidopsis. Finally, transgenic approaches will define the functional role of flavonol glycoside glycosyl hydrolase activity in plants. This research will provide novel insight and understanding of plant flavonoid biology.

"Dynamics in complex systems subjected to strong perturbations combines two of the most challenging problems of theoretical physics, which are few-/many-body physics and non-perturbative dynamics. To date, there exist little theoretical tools that can handle this problem. Over the past few years the group of Dr. Brabec has developed a novel approach called multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF). MCTDHF is the first method that can calculate the dynamics of few-electron systems in the presence of strong perturbations, taking properly account of correlation. Therewith, it opens the opportunity to theoretically investigate a wide spectrum of correlated few electron phenomena that were not accessible so far. 

In this research proposal MCTDHF will be used to address the following three questions. (i) How does intense x-ray radiation interact with matter? 

High intensity x-ray sources promise ground breaking applications in a wide range of areas, including life sciences. 

Understanding of the above question presents a first step to answering the question whether targets can be measured before they are destroyed by intense x-ray radiation. (ii) How does the presence of a laser field enhance electron impact ionization? The interaction of intense laser pulses with matter creates a plasma. Prominent examples are laser micromachining and laser driven electron and x-ray sources. Understanding of laser assisted impact ionization is essential for a correct description of the above processes. (iii) How does correlated few electron dynamics in quantum dots take place? A better understanding of these processes will help to advance the fields of molecular-, nano-electronics, and quantum computation. 

The three topics tackled here fall in Canadian key research areas, such as photonics and nanophysics. The research utilizes a novel tool that will attract international attention. This will strengthen Canada's international standing in the above key areas, therewith fuelling technological development and economic growth.

"Buried polymer structures that are necessary to alleviate two environmental challenges faced by our growing urban areas will be studied.  The first involves geosynthetic liners (thin plastic and clay/fabric liners) to retain contaminants in large landfills for hundreds of years to prevent unacceptable environmental impact (e.g., pollution of surface and ground water). The second uses polymer stormwater retention structures (underground plastic tanks) to manage the increased quantity and decreased quality of runoff from rain and melting snow caused by landscape changes from urban development to limit environmental damage (e.g., erosion, nonpoint source pollution).  To provide environmental protection, rupture of geosynthetic liners when buried beneath enormous amounts of waste and collapse of polymer stormwater retention structures when subjected to large vehicle forces must be prevented.   Knowledge of the physical demand on the polymer structure and the limit states of the polymer structure (puncture, collapse) are essential to prevent unacceptable performance.

     Physical experiments will be devised and conducted, and numerical analyses will be developed and applied to investigate the limit states of landfill geosynthetic liners and polymer stormwater retention structures.  Their physical response depends on both the polymer structure and the surrounding soil.  Consequently the proposed studies combine necessary elements from geotechnical engineering, geosynthetics engineering and engineering mechanics and builds on the applicant's strong track record of solving problems involving buried polymer structures for use in environmental applications.

     The proposed work is anticipated to: (a) improve the long-term physical performance of geosynthetic liners, and hence result in landfills that provide greater long-term environmental protection; and (b) result in cost-effective polymer stormwater retention structures that will reduce the impacts from new and urban infill developments. Two Doctoral and three Masters students will also receive advanced training over five years.

"Ensuring the quality of concurrent programs is a very difficult problem that is becoming increasingly pertinent due to advances in hardware technology. Advances like multi-core processors have resulted in an increase in the need for concurrent software development. Unfortunately, developing correct concurrent code is much more difficult than developing correct sequential code. The objective of the proposed research program is to enhance our understanding of different fault detection techniques for concurrent software and to leverage our understanding to improve and customize the use of these techniques. The research is divided into three topics: 1) empirical assessment and comparison of different fault detection techniques for concurrent systems; 2) domain-specific customization of fault detection techniques like model checking and testing; 3) improving the combined use of different fault detection tools in large software projects. The underlying theme of all topics within the proposed research program is the use of empirical research methods to facilitate better tool usage as well as the development of more effective and efficient fault detection tools. The greatest significance of this work is to the field of software engineering and specifically software quality assurance. In the short term our research program will provide better understanding of today's fault detection tools. The long-term benefit of this research is the development of combined quality assurance approaches that use tools automatically optimized to a particular domain or a particular class of faults.

"The adaptive optics (AO) laboratory, at the University of Victoria, is a participant (since 2005) in a world-class research program; the thirty meter telescope (TMT) project.  The TMT project is a partnership, between Canada and the USA, to design and build the next generation, ground-based optical telescope.  The US partners are comprised of Caltech, the Moore Foundation and the University of California.  The Canadian partners are the National Research Council and ACURA (Association of Canadian Universities for Research in Astronomy).  The rationale for an AO system, coupled to a ground-based telescope, is to remove the image aberrations created when light, from a distant object, passes through the earth's atmosphere.  For very large optical telescopes, adaptive optics is an essential component.  The key components in an AO system are the: wave-front sensor (WFS) that detects the optical aberration; deformable mirror (DM) that changes shape to remove the aberration; and, a real-time control system that optimally adjusts the actuators, of the deformable mirror, in response to the wavefront sensor data.  For a massive instrument, such as TMT, there is no single deformable mirror technology that can provide a sufficiently large number of actuators (order of thousands) that each has a large enough stroke (tens of microns).  Therefore, the UVic laboratory is investigating an AO concept consisting of two deformable mirrors (DMs) working cooperatively.

"This Discovery Grant proposal is for a program of research into the development of new silicon-based and silicon-compatible photonic light emitters.  These will serve as the workhorses for a new generation of on-chip optically interconnected information-processing devices which will revolutionize a wide range of high-performance computing applications.  All these applications require the development of an electrically pumped silicon-based semiconductor laser, a device which has never been fabricated because ordinary crystalline silicon is an indirect bandgap semiconductor which cannot emit light.  However, in 1990 it was demonstrated that modified silicon can be a light emitter.  Currently industry and academic research groups all around the world are aggressively pursuing the goal of being the first to fabricate a working electrically-pumped silicon laser device which can be integrated with existing silicon-based computer chips.  The race is on, and we aim to be the first laboratory in the world to achieve this feat.

"Plants interact with soil in a variety of ways that result in both positive and negative feedbacks.  For example, the roots of some plants may stimulate soil microbes, which in turn can lead to higher soil nutrient availability and faster growth rates for these plants (i.e., positive feedback). Alternatively, some fast-growing plants may deplete soil nutrient reserves, thereby slowing down their own rate of growth and that of their neighbours (i.e., negative feedback).  My research program strives to understand the underlying mechanisms controlling plant-soil feedbacks such as these. Results can be exploited to improve the production of commercially-valued crops and woody biomass, as well as to reduce some of the associated environmental impacts. Specifically, over the next five years my research program will study (i) how plants and soil microbes compete for nutrients; (ii) how plant-produced chemicals are stimulated by, or affect, soil conditions; (iii) the relationship between plant diversity and soil microbial functions; (iv) greenhouse gas emissions from soil. Results will be relevant and applicable to the management of renewable resources, to the development of policy on biodiversity issues, and to provide guidelines for the certification of production practices. The beneficiaries of this research program are stakeholders in the Canadian agriculture and forest industries, two major drivers of our national economy, as well as environmentally-conscious Canadians.

"Over the next five years, the research that I intend to undertake includes: (1) A study of the thermal history of at least two transects across the Canadian Cordillera and adjacent Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. This should improve our understanding of ties between orogenic 'events' and subsidence/depositional events in the basin; it should also help constrain the timing of petroleum generation and migration in the basin. (2) Continuation of mapping and Apatite Helium dating in the northern California Coast Ranges, in an attempt to use isochrons within the Apatite Helium fossil partial retention zone as structural markers in this large, multiply deformed terrain. This is a novel application of a new dating method as a geochemical mapping tool. If successful, this should result in significant improvements in the understanding of the kinematic evolution of transtensional basins in general, and along the Maacama Fault in particular. (3) Development of thermal models for parts of the crust in the central Basin and Range Province; this work is based on studies of the distribution of radioactive heat producing elements in the crustal exposures of the South Virgin Mts., Nevada. It should permit testing of models that call for a hot, fluid mid-crustal layer during Tertiary extension, and of suggestions that the Proterozoic anorogenic granites in the region formed by in-situ melting due to radiogenic heating of an otherwise stable crust. (4) A study of which minerals contain most of the radioactive elements in samples from the Sierra Nevada batholith, California and South Virgin Mts., Nevada. This will help determine to what extent the natural distribution of radioactive minerals is controlled by primary magmatic processes versus later hydrothermal alteration.","Sciences de la terre","Avancement des connaissances","Solid Earth Sciences",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"The Paleozoic  (from  542 to 251 million years ago) was a time of extraordinary events and geologic upheaval such as the extraordinary radiation of life, extraterrestrial impacts and mass extinctions, all punctuated by both alpine and continental glaciations. The study proposes to collect proxy material (i.e. brachiopods and trilobites) and examine the geochemical evidence (trace and isotope chemistry) to characterize these events. Material for this project will come from two major sources, one being carbonates deposited on seamount Japan during the Paleozoic reflecting Panthalassic Ocean (precursor Pacific) oceanography and from large and continuous successions at the North American continental margin. The latter localities are unique and important in that the successions are sedimentologically & stratigraphically well defined in the context of Paleozoic biogeography. 

Construction of global seawater records will consist of material judged by a multitude of evaluation criteria to contain a pristine and primary signal; others will be discarded. These ultra-high (�10,000 y) seawater records of sea surface temperature (SST) and composition (SSC) will provide a tool for better understanding events and changes of the Earth's biologic, geologic, and hydrologic systems. Another major underpinning of this approach will be the use of the revolutionary 'clumped isotope thermometer', which allows for the direct determination of ambient seawater temperature and the subsequent computation of its oxygen isotopic composition and salinity. 

The Paleozoic, a time of numerous ice ages including the LPIA (Late Paleozoic Ice Age), is considered one of the largest in the geologic record as well as the one reflecting most closely the last Ice Age. Near-field evidence (of others) coupled with the far-field results will allow for better constraints as to timing, duration, extent and causes of both glaciation and de-glaciation events (greenhouse gas warming). This study period, because of the lack of an anthropogenic factor, may provide fundamental and important information for judging the human impact on the Earth's current climatic situation.

"My work spans a wide range of topics in theoretical cosmology, ranging from the search of a new early universe scenario based on superstring theory to searches for specific signatures of current models of structure formation. At the moment, the main emphasis of my research is on superstring cosmology. In particular, we are exploring ``string gas cosmology'', a toy model of string cosmology which makes crucial use of aspects which differentiate string theory from previous theories. We have proposed a new structure formation scenario based on string gas cosmology, and one aspect of the proposed work will be to work out in more detail its specific predictions for observations. String gas cosmology is, however, a toy model. A major part of my research effort in the medium term will be to turn the model into a real theory.



The study of small fluctuations produced in the early universe, and the analysis of dynamical instabilities in the evolution of the very early universe have been focal points of my research over the past decade. Both topics yield tools of crucial importance in connecting theories of the very early universe with current observations. I plan to study new applications of these tools. In particular, they may lead to signatures of the presence of extra dimensions of space, and they may lead to important constraints on finding a particle physics model which goes beyond the current Standard Model. Finally, we plan to develop new tools for searching for cosmic string signals in upcoming cosmological data.

"After fertilization an egg cleaves to form a multi-cellular embryo. The embryo becomes organized via morphogenetic processes and cellular differentiation into a complex body consisting of organs having specialized tissues.  The cells of the embryo acquire specialized fates appropriate for their position in the embryo and then differentiate.  This specification of fates is the result of patterning events that depend on the organization of the egg imposed during oogenesis and on cellular interactions that involve intercellular signalling molecules and their receptors.  The activities of many of these signalling molecules depend on their interactions with complex sulfated proteoglycans on the surface of cells and in the extra-cellular matrix.  We will investigate these events in a simple marine embryo (the sea urchin), which in many ways develops like mammalian embryos.  It develops externally in sea water and is transparent, allowing microscopy examination and experimental interventions.  We have found that experimental inhibition of the formation of sulfated proteoglycans disrupts the patterning of these embryos as well as some morphogenetic events, gastrulation and mouth formation in particular.  We are taking advantage of information derived from the recently sequenced genome of the sea urchin to gain a better understanding of the role of sulphated proteoglycans by knocking down the expression of genes involved in their formation and modification. We hypothesize that auto-regulatory signalling by Nodal is required for establishment and maintenance of the oral-aboral (ventral-dorsal) axis and completion of gastrulation and that Nodal depends on interactions with sulfated proteoglycans to which it probably binds.  We will also investigate the expression and possible roles in sea urchin embryos and larvae of genes involved in vision and hearing in higher vertebrates.  These genes, including some required for retina formation in mammals and the genes of the Usher syndrome in humans, were surprisingly found in the sea urchin genome and many are expressed in embryos (which lack eyes and ears).","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"Summary of the Proposal



Stevia is a plant species native to the Paraguay that produces a high intensity sweetener in its leaf tissue.  This natural product can be up to 300 times sweeter than sugar and is of considerable interest to a society trying to reduce carbohydrate intake and at the same time shift towards more  natural.  The same tools used to sequence the human genome were successfully applied to Stevia in a effort to  understand the genetic and biochemical basis of sweetener production.  Now, through genetic enhancement technologies, those discoveries are to be used to bring the sweet compounds to other foods and for the production of medicines.",Agriculture,"Avancement des connaissances","Plant Biology & Food Science",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"The vast majority of research on peatlands and surface water quality has been done in small catchments, often with highly simplified water balances, and this certainly applies to investigations of the role of peatlands in mercury fate and transport. There have been no attempts to scale up the process-based knowledge that we have about Hg cycling in small peatlands to the larger extensive peatland systems of the world.  The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) is the second largest contiguous peatland in the world, with a total area of  approximately 320 000 sq km.  The HBL is in a region that is likely to be subjected to the most significant increases in annual average temperature due to climate change of anywhere in the world.    The absence of process-oriented hydrological and water quality data means that the potentially dramatic impacts of a changing climate on the hydrological and biogeochemical processes of the peatlands of the HBL and the subsequent changes to the mercury cycle are unknown.  Given the importance of the mercury cycle to northern ecosystems and communities, this is a significant knowledge gap.    By undertaking research on the hydrology and mercury biogeochemistry in both the southern discontinuous and northern continuous permafrost zones of the HBL, I hope to: 1) elucidate the contributions of the HBL peatlands to the budget of water, total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) of major tributaries of Hudson/James Bay; 2) gain mechanistic insight into the processes that control MeHg production and transport in the extensive peatlands of the HBL with varying ground ice conditions, and; 3) apply a landscape-based model of peatland-watershed processes to the extensive peatland watersheds of the HBL.  Research findings will provide important guidance for land-use management and northern communities in a region that is coming under increasing pressure for resource extraction, and offer insights into the potential hydrological and biogeochemical alterations of the more northern rivers as climate change begins to impact the extent of permafrost.

"According to Health Canada, by the year 2021, approximately 20% of Canada's population will be seniors. This fact has multidimensional consequences for our society. One promising solution to socio-economical aging-related problems is the promotion and implementation of aging-in-place strategies. Aging-in-place is based on a proactive, preventive approach to sustain elderly health, quality of life and wellbeing. 

Recent technological advances can provide a significant support for independent senior living. For instance, assistive technologies can be helpful in monitoring the successful completion of activities of daily living. Computer vision technologies for marker-less motion analysis offer a promising alternative to marker-based motion capture systems, which are expensive and not portable to non-clinical environments.

The main goal of our research program is to build a computer vision-based framework for the analysis of basic human actions in order to quantify the motion performance. The main question that we plan to investigate is ""How well is the motion performed?"". Our research plan focuses on two main objectives as follows:

- Human motion analysis from silhouette data;

- Human motion analysis from feature points data.

Our experimental database will consist in normal and abnormal basic actions (walking, sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit, bending down, reaching etc.) which will be simulated by physiotherapists specialized in elderly care. Working with simulated motion is suitable for the implementation of our research plan, since it allows for a structured analysis of the complete spectrum of motion abnormalities, as well as for validating the new motion models with physiotherapists in the loop.

On a long-term basis, once the motion models are fully developed and sucessfully validated with simulated motion, they will be tested with real elderly subjects for performance quantification purposes.

"(1) Protein interfacial behaviour:  Proteins have a strong tendency to adsorb at interfaces and this has important consequences for a number of areas of biotechnology (eg food processing, diagnostic systems, biosensors and protein separation and purification).  There is a need for improved understanding of protein adsorption so that it can be controlled as required for a given purpose.  We will be addressing the following broad questions: (a) the nature of protein surface binding, (b) the orientation of adsorbed proteins, (c) conformational changes and alteration of biologic function. We will study the adsorption kinetics and equilibria of selected protein-surface systems and develop mechanistic models of adsorption.  The models will incorporate specific orientation and time dependent conformational changes. In this work we make use of advanced experimental methods such as neutron reflectometry (collaboration with NRC Chalk River) and methods requiring synchrotron radiation (Canadian Light Source). 

 (2) Modification of solid surfaces: Surface modification is of great importance in biotechnology applications such as biosensors, bioprocess equipment and medical devices. In general one wants to keep the bulk properties of the material intact while tailoring the surface to impart specific properties, especially resistance to biofouling. Contact lenses, for example, are gradually ""spoiled"" by the uptake of proteins from tear fluid. Our research in this area is based on three main approaches: (a) gas plasma treatment of polymer surfaces by plasma polymerization, (b) modification of surfaces using gold-thiol chemistry, (c) polymer grafting using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) a novel polymerization method which allows control over the polymer molecular weight distribution. Emphasis will be on non biofouling surfaces based on polyethylene oxide and other protein repelling agents.

"In water and moist soil environments, unicellular organisms (termed protozoa) eat bacteria for food. One type of bacteria, Legionella, is a parasite of protozoa and when ingested, uses the protozoan host cell as a food source for its lifecycle. The Legionella lifecycle is unique because it alternates between two bacterial forms: the replicative form (RF) and the cyst-like form (CLF). When food is abundant, RFs actively replicate themselves and when the bacteria sense that food is becoming scarce, the RFs differentiate into CLFs, a dormant form that has fortified cell walls to ensure survival in the environment. The spent protozoan host cell bursts open releasing the CLFs into the environment where they will be ingested by foraging protozoa repeating the life-cycle. The CLFs are much more infectious than the RFs, and it is currently believed that when CLFs are aerosolized in water droplets and inadvertently inhaled by humans, causes a respiratory infection called Legionnaires' disease (LD). Individuals at high risk of contracting the disease are very often immunocompromised whereas healthy individuals are at low risk. Recent reports documenting the occurrence of LD in people after exposure to garden potting soil has led to the proposal that an additional and/or alternative route for transmission of infectious Legionella bacteria to susceptible individuals may originate from nematodes that naturally exist in soil. The 1-mm long soil nematodes are non-parasitic and eat bacteria for food. This research is intended to investigate the molecular regulatory mechanisms controlling CLF formation of which results will lead to improved control measures, detection, and treatment strategies. In addition, this research will determine if Legionella can survive and replicate within the nutrient-rich nematode digestive tract, and if so, investigate whether the soil nematodes can retain and disperse Legionella bacteria within the soil. The implication that free-living nematodes may serve both as reservoir and an amplifier of Legionella in the natural environment highlights an ecological factor that was not previously considered in the etiology of Legionnaire's disease, and thereby poses a dramatic impact on the current understanding of the disease.

"The ability of cells to function and communicate with one another in the complex tissue environments of the body is dependent upon the controlled movement of ions such as sodium, calcium, potassium and chloride, into and out of each individual cell.  Such movement occurs primarily through water-filled pores or channels formed by protein complexes embedded in cell membranes. Understanding the mechanisms by which membrane ion channels contribute to the gross functional responses of a tissue, such as muscle contraction, secretion of hormones, or the propagation of nervous impulses, has been a long-established goal of medical research.  In smooth muscle, potassium (K+) efflux may be the single most important physiologic determinant of smooth muscle function, by regulating the influx of calcium that triggers contraction.  In this respect, the cellular mechanisms controlling K+ efflux in smooth muscle cells are of fundamental importance to the regulation of vascular tone and the physiologic functions of other smooth muscle-containing organs (eg. lungs, gut, kidney, bladder).  The studies described in this research proposal will examine the molecular properties and regulation of a special class of calcium- and voltage-sensitive K+ channel that plays a major role in the control of systemic blood pressure, lung airway dilation and bladder filling. In particular, we will elucidate how this important channel protein is regulated by chemical signals (i.e. nitric oxide) produced by the endothelial lining of blood vessels, along with clinically prescribed nitrovasodilators, such as nitroglycerin. The functional properties of this ion channel and its regulation by nitric oxide-mediated cell signaling pathways will be studied by combining molecular DNA-based technology with sensitive electrical recording techniques that allow detection of channel activity within a single smooth muscle cell.  These proposed studies will provide important, new insight into the structure, function and modulation of an ion channel with potential as a novel therapeutic target for drugs in the treatment of asthma, incontinence and blood pressure-related illnesses.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"One of the main goals of this project is to improve curve and surface estimation when data are limited but when input from scientific experts is available.    A number of smoothing techniques exist for flexibly modeling data, and these techniques have good properties.  It is possible to apply these techniques to forms of data which have been adjusted according to previously available science.  Depending on the accuracy of the science, the resulting estimates should be better than those obtained from the unadjusted data.  The technique of modifying the data, taking into account qualitative information, is called data sharpening.    By employing data sharpening, scientists should be able to obtain improved estimates of quantities they are interested in (usually in the form of curves and surfaces), and they should also be able to obtain better predictions as a result.  Software for data sharpening will be developed in order to handle a wide variety of modeling problems.  



The project will also be concerned with incomplete forms of data, such as where data are not measured precisely but are instead reported in the form of an interval which contains the true measurement.  Again, we are interested in estimating curves and surfaces.  The data sharpening method will be applied here when there is additional qualitative information about the curves or surfaces,  in addition to iterative methods that are under development.  Methods of resampling data are also being studied; these  methods (called bootstrap methods) are used to estimate variability in parameter estimates in situations where closed form mathematical formulae are not available.  



Some of the statistical methods being developed in this proposal will find direct application in forest fire management and in climate modeling.  In particular, smoothing methods and bootstrap methods will be applied to input data for a deterministic forest fire spread model, leading to probability maps of fire occurrence.  Smoothing-based clustering algorithms will be applied to storm systems in order to aid in modeling and prediction.

"The ultimate goal of my research program is to understand how evolutionary pressures have shaped physiological systems among vertebrates and the degree to which physiological systems can adapt/acclimate to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. The long-term focus is to investigate the physiological basis for whole animal performance in fish in relation to gas-exchange, acid-base balance and ion regulation, specifically with regard to the interaction among these processes which occurs in vivo, integrating responses at molecular, cellular and organismal level. The short-term goals here focus on the interaction between gas exchange and acid-base regulation in fish. 



The proposed experiments are designed to test novel hypotheses with regard to the evolution of the Root effect and optimization of O2 delivery in fish, and to elucidate patterns and mechanisms of acid-base regulation in ""primitive"" fish that may be associated with the evolution of air-breathing and consequently, the transition of life from water to land. 



Findings in both areas will add significantly to our understanding of the evolution of complex physiological systems. The research is interdisciplinary, spanning the range of molecular, cellular, and whole animal, investigating interactions among physiological processes (gas exchange and acid-base balance), and placing the findings in an evolutionary context.

"The goal of this research is to better understand and significantly improve the interaction between the increasingly complex components that comprise modern Internet services.  We believe that existing Internet services and the operating systems on which they place such heavy demands can be improved, especially when executing in modern multi-processor and multi-core environments.  These improvements will enable Internet services to support more simultaneous users, provide better peak throughput and ensure that high throughput and low response times are maintained, even during periods of high load.



While the majority of existing research has concentrated on web servers that provide static content, most Internet services deliver dynamically generated content tailored to individual users.  This is done using an architecture comprising three main tiers: web servers, application servers, and database servers.  Usually these different tiers are spread across multiple host systems.  With multi-core chips already available and the number of cores per chip expected to double every eighteen months, the first two tiers of these services are being migrated to a single host with multiple cores and/or processors which will provide significantly more processing power.  We plan to better understand and significantly improve the execution of the first two tiers and eventually all three tiers on a single system.  These systems provide opportunities for faster and better interaction among some or all of the components that comprise the service.  This will result in faster delivery of high quality services to end users while offering cost savings on the machines and their operating costs.

"In everyday life, listeners face a mixture of overlapped sounds. Yet only a single acoustic waveform reaches their ears: the sum of the waveforms of all concurrent sounds. The applicant has given the name ""auditory scene analysis"" (ASA) to the process by which the brain analyzes the summed waveform and forms descriptions of the individual sounds. Some acoustic components of this waveform must be integrated (e.g., those of a single sound source, such as a voice), and others must be segregated (those coming from different sound sources). The applicant has described ASA as a problem of the ""binding"" of information into representations of individual sound sources. He has investigated the cues employed in this binding and some properties of the ASA system. However the exact mechanisms are unknown. There is strong evidence that non-human animals solve the ASA problem. If they do it in the same way that people do, and if good analogs of tests of ASA can be found for animals, this opens the door to the study of the brain mechanisms of ASA. This study has already begun on at least three species. Recent research has also demonstrated ASA in newborn human infants, pointing to a specific genetic basis for this capacity.

    The present research is directed towards a better understanding of ASA through laboratory studies on humans, through collaborations with researchers studying ASA in non-human animals, and others measuring brain activity, and through theoretical analysis. This knowledge will allow us to design better prostheses for the deaf (e.g., better systems for the presentation of sounds in auditory implants); better alarms and signals for the workplace that will stand out against competing sounds; and more robust computer programs for speech recognition. It will also provide a scientific foundation for both musical composition, where the control of the blending or segregation of different musical lines is a central problem, and the art of the audio engineer who must control blending and segregation in a musical recording. In fact, ASA is to the musical arts what the study of perceptual organization in vision is to the visual arts.

"This research program is mainly concerned with understanding the pattern, evolution and controls on ice motion, stability and decay within the ice masses that covered much of Canada and the northern United States during the last ice age. It is important to understand the behaviour of ancient ice sheets because the models developed for their growth, decay, geometry and stability can be used to predict the behaviour of present-day Arctic and Antarctic ice masses that in turn influence global sea level and climate. Ice motion is, in large part, governed by processes taking place at the glacier bed. The beds of present-day ice sheets are difficult to access, so we turn to the beds of ancient ice sheets (the landforms and sediments that they left behind) to explore the processes that regulate ice dynamics over broad areas, at a variety of scales and perhaps over whole ice ages. Processes taking place at the glacier bed impact ice sheet properties (e.g., thickness, geometry, debris content) and likely have an enduring effect on the rate, style and geometry of ice sheet decay. Research in this application probes the beds of ancient ice sheets, and their landscapes of decay, in order to enhance our understanding of ice motion, stability and decay.

      This research will collect new data from ancient glacier bed (subglacial) landforms and sediments in southern British Columbia and Washington State that will contribute significantly to our understanding of the formation of glacial landforms, the evolution of glacial landscapes, and the motion and plumbing of ancient ice sheets. It will provide new decay (deglacial) ages for the Cordilleran Ice Sheet in southern British Columbia, and may lead to a new model of ice sheet decay that responds to the distribution, extent and drainage of subglacial lakes. The observations and concepts generated by this program are vital to predicting the future behaviour of present-day ice sheets, such as those in Antarctica and Greenland, and will provide critical data for ice sheet models. In addition, the results of this research are anticipated to impact industry in the area of drift prospecting.

"Landslide hazards and rock glaciers are two areas of growing public concern because they are related to the safety of exposed human populations and the impacts of climate change on mountain areas and their forelands. This research focuses on improving landslide hazard modeling and rock glacier mapping over large mountain areas through the optimal selection and adaptation of computational techniques.

In predictive modeling of landslide hazards and risk, susceptibility maps are generated by empirical or process-based classification techniques that discriminate between potentially unstable and stable slopes. Thus, improvements in classification techniques will have a direct impact on the reliability of susceptibility maps used for risk assessment. We will approach this challenge by selecting optimal empirically based methods, and by combining these approaches with physically based models of slope stability.

Rock glacier and permafrost mapping can be viewed as a spatial classification problem, in which the combination of satellite and topographic data with modern classification techniques promises to provide reliable automatic mapping algorithms. We intend to develop this kind of algorithm, and to test and refine it using satellite imagery and field mapping results from the Yukon Territory. This will provide regional estimates of the amount of water stored within rock glaciers, and result in methods that can be applied in mountain areas worldwide to obtain baseline data on permafrost distribution for modeling climate impacts.

As a prerequisite for achieving these advances in rock glacier and landslide modeling, we further investigate the underlying theoretical problem of spatial classification and accuracy assessment.

"The research program will focus on investigating the conversion of fats and oils to second generation biofuels. Specifically the research will focus around the fundamental chemistry and kinetics of unsaturated fatty acids under pyrolytic conditions. The anticipated products will be true hydrocarbons and therefore are expected to not only be renewable, but will be directly compatible to the existing petrochemical and fuel industry. The approaches utilized are adapted from bitumen upgrading research, at which the University of Alberta is a world leader, and thus equipment, protocols and the insights on reaction chemistry are well understood by the research group. The proposed program is a continuation of Dr. Bressler's current NSERC Discovery program which has resulted in several significant breakthroughs in this area. This application is focused on building upon the successes of the current program and expands the research to address several fundamental questions that remain to be answered. The previous round of funding resulted in several manuscripts and pending United States of America and International PCT patent applications that were the result of utilizing a fundamental research approach employing model compounds to study high temperature thermal processing of lipids to hydrocarbons. Novel pyrolytic approaches were developed that revealed the parameters critical for batch conversion of triglycerides to hydrocarbons through a two step process.

   It is anticipated that the program will support one PhD student and two sequential masters students over the five year period. The students will all have backgrounds in chemical engineering and will study the reaction behavior of unsaturated fatty acids at high temperature under both batch and continuous reaction conditions using both model compound studies and studies utilizing several natural oil and fat sources.  Additionally, they will study the use of continuous reactors on pyrolysis of both saturated and unsaturated lipid feedstocks. These studies will reveal the effect of process parameters including time, pressure, temperature, and recycle streams on continous reactor operation.

"    )	The immune system exists in all vertebrates and provides a sophisticated defense against invaders. It has the remarkable property of being able to fight these invaders in a very specific way, such that the immune response to one virus, say, is only effective against this virus and not another virus. This is the property of specificity. The interaction of the recognition molecules of the immune system and the invader is often likened to the interaction of a key with its lock. Secondly, the immune system appears to be able to fight every invader it encounters. This property is called universality. Specificity and universality can be likened to a key shop, that has keys on hand able to open every lock in the world, even those not yet invented! Molecules able to be recognized by these specific molecules are called antigens.

          The immune system also has the potential to recognize and attack parts of the body of which it is a part. This does not usually happen, but can in some diseases like autoimmune diabetes. In this case the immune system attacks the �-islet cells that produce insulin. Thus there are ways of turning these very specific immune responses on, and tuning them off. The proposed studies test ideas on how this might happen. 

        We know that the immune system contains billions of cells, each one different. Each cell has a receptor able to very specifically recognize a particular part of an antigen, and an ability to produce more of this receptor/recognition molecule if the cell is activated on receptor engagement. Hopefully, this ""activation"" of the cell occurs when the receptor recognizes a virus. It hopefully does not occur when the cell's receptor recognizes a �-islet cell that produces insulin. In this case, it would be advantageous if the cell is silenced or ""inactivated"" when its receptor interacts with antigen. Thus interaction of a cell's receptors with antigen can lead to the activation or inactivation of the cell. The studies proposed here are directed at understanding the differences in the way antigen interacts with these cells to cause their activation or inactivation.

"Given increasing global trade and climate change, the ecological and economical sustainability of Canada's forests are increasingly threatened by native and alien invasive insects that carry fungal pathogens to commercial and ornamental trees. The current mountain pine beetle (MPB) epidemic in western Canada illustrates the scale of the devastating immediate and long-term effects of such epidemics, which involve specific interactions between a host, vector and pathogen. The MPB epidemic spreads by a beetle population mass-attacking lodgepole pine trees and overcoming tree defences, then reproducing in galleries under the bark. The MPB-vectored fungi are a key symbiotic component in the epidemic, because they provide essential help to the beetles in overcoming tree defences and subsequently serve as a nutrient source for the beetle progeny. When the vectored fungi have bypassed a tree's physical and chemical defenses, they rapidly colonize the tree phloem and sapwood, and kill the tree by blocking water transport to the crown. As well, the fungi stain the tree sapwood, reducing the industrial value of the wood and wood fibres. The vectored fungi are tree pathogens; they can kill trees when inoculated without the beetles. Our primary target will be the blue-stain fungus Ophiostoma clavigerum, the most pathogenic fungal MPB associate in the western Canada epidemic.  Our long-term objective is to clarify the mechanisms of fungal pathogenicity.  Specifically, we will identify naturally occurring oleoresin and phenolic fungicides that are the major components of lodgepole pine defence systems, and will characterize how they interfere with germination and growth of O. clavigerum. We will use biochemical and molecular approaches, taking advantage of molecular reagents generated in our previous work.

"Positively charged muons (an unstable form of antimatter produced at the TRIUMF accelerator) have several exotic properties which allow them to be used to probe the electromagnetic properties of materials using techniques known as Muon Spin Rotation/Relaxation/Resonance (�SR).  The only �SR facility in the Americas (and one of only two of its kind in the world) is supported by NSERC at TRIUMF, where I strive to develop and improve �SR methods and capabilities applicable to my main physics interests:   Since high temperature superconductors (HTSC) were discovered in 1986-87, �SR has been an essential probe of their properties; its unique sensitivity to weak and disordered magnetism allows us to study the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in these important new materials, to help understand how such things can exist and to better understand their electromagnetic properties so that their use in practical devices may be hastened.  As a member of the CIAR Quantum Materials program I have learned that many of the magnetic properties of HTSC are governed by the cooperative behaviour of strongly correlated electrons, which is also manifest in the magnetism of other materials, such as cobalt oxides which are candidate materials for thermoelectric devices to convert heat directly into electricity.  I collaborate with Japanese scientists to study such potential applications; I also have an ongoing collaboration with Russian scientists to study insulators and semiconductors, in which a muonium (Mu) atom is often formed when a positive muon captures an electron liberated by its passage.  By studying the field dependence of Mu formation, we have been able to determine the mobility of charge carriers in various materials - information vital to their use in devices.  Recently we have combined the above �SR methods to study magnetic semiconductors - candidate materials for ""spintronics"" devices which could perform electronic logic operations and store magnetic information simultaneously.  The techniques of �SR can also be applied to various fundamental physics investigations; I am active in several of these at TRIUMF, including the TWIST experiment and several studies of muonic atoms.","Sciences des mat�riaux","Avancement des connaissances","Condensed Matter Physics",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"In industry, statistically designed experiments are used to improve the quality of products and processes.  In screening experiments the goal is to identify the factors that have the biggest impact on quality.  In robustness experiments the goal is to choose settings for the control factors to make the product or process less sensitive to uncontrolled variation (noise).  Often the screening or robustness experiments have a ""split-plot"" structure.  In some cases, this is because of the presence of hard-to-vary and easy-to-vary factors or because of constraints imposed by the equipment.  In other cases, it is because the experimenter is more interested in certain effects than others.  



This proposal is concerned with both the design and analysis of industrial experiments, with a particular emphasis on split-plot designs.  With respect to design, there are two broad objectives:  the first is to develop a unifying way of thinking about optimality criteria for fractional factorial split-plot designs, with or without blocking, and to construct catalogs of optimal designs; the second is to develop optimality criteria for semi-foldover plans for fractional factorial split-plot designs, with or without blocking, and to construct catalogs of optimal plans.  With respect to analysis, there are also two broad objectives.  The first objective is to use the post-data pivotal approach to provide an alternative way of analyzing data that arise from split-plot experiments in industry and to extend this approach to other types of industrial experiments.  The post-data pivotal approach circumvents difficulties that occur with classical inference procedures in constrained parameter space problems.  For example, these difficulties include negative estimates of variance components in split-plot experiments.  The second objective is to develop new ways of analyzing data arising from computer experiments with functional output.

"The speed and power of modern computers is truly impressive. So much so, that one might believe any reasonable problem can be solved, even by brute force, in reasonable time. Surprisingly this is not the case. Consider the problem of assigning resources to a collection of users, for example scheduling teams in a round robin tournament.  The goal is to assign the resources in the most efficient way possible, subject to constraints restricting the assignments. This a Constraint Satisfaction Problem or CSP.  For a fast computer to exhaustively search through all the possible combinations looking for the optimum assignment could take thousands of years. This is an example of ""combinatorial explosion""; the sheer number of combinations defeats brute force solutions. More efficient algorithms, if they exist, must be employed. 

 

The primary aim of my program is to identify those CSPs which admit efficient algorithms (polynomial time solvable) and those which are intractable (NP-complete). Fundamentally we would like to know if such a dichotomy of efficient versus intractable holds for all CSPs.  This would provide an understanding of the nature of these challenging combinatorial problems.



Efficient algorithms are typically based on mathematical structure known as ""good characterizations"".  A good characterization guides one through the combinatorial explosion to a solution for the CSP or to a proof that the CSP has no solution, i.e. there are too many constraints, at which point the search can stop. We seek to develop mathematical theory in the form of good characterizations for CSPs. The develop of this theory can be used to solve particular CSPs, but more importantly it gives insight into the fundamental dichotomy question above.  

 

My research program focuses on combinatorial problems from graph homomorphisms and digraph packings.

"The primary goal of this research program is the advancement of the relatively underdeveloped synthetic and structural chemistry of a class of heavy metals, known as the heavy p-block metals.  This is being achieved through the preparation and characterization of series of compounds which systematically highlight heavy metal chemical bonding interactions.  Over the past number of years, interest in organometallic compounds incorporating heavy p-block metals has grown due to their utility as precursors for advanced production of inorganic materials with specific electronic properties, such as low band-gap semiconductor thin films (InP)  and nanoparticles (PbS),  and high temperature superconductors thin films (TlBaCaCuO).  We are developing methods to manipulate the structural chemistry of heavy p-block metal compounds, which is essential for the preparation of precursors with specific bulk properties (e.g. increased solubility, high volatility, efficient mass transport) required for advanced inorganic materials processing.  This work is also significant to several other areas of fundamental and applied chemistry, namely: 1) synthetic inorganic/organometallic chemistry, in the development of facile routes to novel heavy p-block metal compounds; 2) supramolecular chemistry, through incorporation of heavy p-block metals into interesting self-assembled frameworks; and 3) catalysis, through the preparation of cationic bismuth compounds which are potentially reactive toward organic compounds.  The long-term goals of this research program involve investigating the application of target compounds to these areas.

"Advances in the development of high-frequency integrated circuits and devices are being made at a phenomenal pace. Much of this is driven by recent novel materials and by nanofabrication technologies, enabling unique structures and making possible exciting new devices and sensors. In this research program we will develop new nanoprobe tools for testing these devices and investigate new sensor and imaging applications. 



There has recently been significant effort in the use of mm-wave and sub-mm-wave frequencies for broadband information communication technologies, for radar and imaging, and for material characterization and bio-diagnostic applications. Being able to gain information on the internal operation of the circuits and devices operating at these frequencies is crucial for their development and is especially needed as when employing novel materials or MEMS based technologies. However, there are currently few viable tools for providing both high-spatial resolution (nanometer) and high-frequency (mm-wave) capabilities. We will be developing new scanning probe microscopy tools to address this regime. This will be achieved through custom fabrication of shielded scanning probes with integrated transmission lines that are capable of delivering localized mm-wave signals to a scanning probe nanometer sized tip. The ability to image, stimulate and sense at high frequencies with a shielded nanometer sized probe makes possible many novel applications. We will employ this for high-frequency stimulation and microwave impedance imaging in single cell biodiagnostic systems.

"This research will develop new numerical algorithms for challenging problems in computational physics, e.g. simulating how air and water flow, or how solid objects collide and deform. The focus application is computer animation, building on this researcher's present and future collaborations with the film industry. Here many of the most difficult animation problems, such as producing photorealistic water or clothing, can be solved by simulating the underlying physics. However, this project is primarily concerned with the core algorithmic issues, which are of much broader interest in science and engineering, in particular the following:



1) Discretization of Constrained Continuum Mechanics: many natural phenomena of interest to both animators and scientists are constrained: for example, incompressibility for fluid flow and biological tissue, developability (a restriction against in-plane deformation) for cloth and paper, inextensibility for hair, and collision/contact problems between solids. This project will create a new unified framework for handling all these problems in a computer simulation.



2) Efficient Solution of the Resulting Optimization Problems: the bottleneck for these simulations is often solving a large optimization problem: e.g. how to find forces that minimize the energy of the system, subject to physical constraints. This research will create new, more efficient methods for solving these important classes of problems.



3) Robust Geometric Methods for Physical Simulation: Another major challenge in simulating many physical phenomena is dealing with geometric problems, such as tracking the surface of a liquid. I seek to develop efficient and accurate techniques that are provably robust.

"Canada has extensive reserves of heavy oils, including bitumen extracted from tar sands. In addition, heavy oils constitute a significant component of many conventional types of crude. Heavy oils must be upgraded to cleaner and more valuable products. One of the most advanced upgraders are Fluid Cokers, where 15 to 20% of Canada's crude oil is produced. Heavy oil is sprayed into a fluidized bed of hot coke particles where its long hydrocarbon chains are thermally cracked into more valuable fragments, which form a synthetic crude oil. About 20 wt% of the bitumen feed is converted to solid coke, which deposits on the bed particles. About 40% of the steam used in fluid cokers goes to the attrition nozzles, which grind the particles to maintain them at their optimum size. If attrition nozzles could be operated with a much lower steam flowrate, the fluid cokers could produce more synthetic crude with less carbon dioxide emissions and less wastewater.

 The vision which drives this proposal, which is sponsored by Syncrude Canada, is to develop attrition nozzles that will dramatically reduce the consumption of steam. The proposed program will run for 2 years. Its first deliverable will be the optimization of the geometry of the attrition nozzles. The impact of operating parameters such as nozzle size, particle size, bed temperature, attrition steam pressure and temperature on the attrition efficiency will then be quantified. NSERC funding will allow for longer-term deliverables such the development of completely new attrition nozzle designs, and a general,  comprehensive model of attrition jets.  The Canadian companies that use fluid cokers, Syncrude Canada and Imperial Oil, will greatly benefit from the proposed research, which will make them more competitive and reduce their environmental footprint.  Other companies either upgrade bitumen with delayed cokers or dilute raw bitumen with solvent and pipe it to the USA.  By making fluid cokers more attractive, the proposed research would help create new high value jobs in Canada, and encourage a switch from delayed coking to fluid coking, which would cut greenhouse emissions by about 50% for each barrel of synthetic crude.    )

"The objective of this proposal is to develop a new, practical technology for the conversion of agricultural waste

into fuels and valuable products. Pyrolysis is an ideal process for the conversion of biomass into high

value-added products. It produces bio-oil that can be shipped to a biorefinery for refining into green chemicals

and biofuels. The most promising technologies for biomass pyrolysis on a commercial scale are the fluidized

bed pyrolyzers, which include downers and risers for short residence times, and bubbling/turbulent fluidized

beds for longer residence times.

The proposed research will use riser, downer and regular fluidized pilot plants to pyrolyze several feedstocks of

special interest to Canada. Its results will help identify the most promising pyrolysis technology and conditions

for each of the following feedstocks:

1) Tobacco waste can be converted into a liquid from which an effective, green insecticide can be extracted.

The rest of the liquid can be used as biofuel.

2) Flax cultivation is expanding rapidly since its seeds contain omega-3 oil, a neutraceutical. Its straw is a

waste material that cannot be plowed under and is highly polluting when burnt.

3) Current, first generation processes for the conversion of corn into bio-ethanol are not very energy efficient

because they produce large amounts of waste either in the field (corn stover) or in the plant (distillers grains).

Distillers grains will be pyrolyzed to a liquid for further refining.

4) Cellulosic ethanol, obtained by enzymatic conversion currently produces large amounts of waste material.

In contrast, pyrolysis converts the whole plant to a bio-oil, which can be refined into chemicals and biofuels.

The proposed project will study the conversion of corn stover into bio-oil.

If successful, this project will provide the foundations for the creation of a new, Canadian, bioprocessing

industry for the production of energy and green chemicals from waste biomass.","Ressources d'�nergie (production, exploration, traitement, distribution et utilisation de l'�nergie)","Ressources d'�nergie","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario

"The proximate currency that best explains the behaviour by animals in general and endotherms in particular, is energy.  Research has focused on energy acquisition whereas my ongoing focus is to determine how, when and why endotherms (birds and mammals) employ heterothermy (e.g., torpor).  For endotherms, defending a constant elevated body temperature confers fundamental physiological advantages.  However the benefits must be balanced against high energetic costs, which come with elevated metabolic rates.  These high costs can be offset by periods of torpor which results in reduced metabolic rates and as a consequence energetic savings.  



To enhance the general applicability of our research, my students and I work on insectivorous bats and nocturnal insect eating birds (nightjars).  Despite the phylogenetic distance between them, these groups converge ecologically and physiologically.  My short-term goal is to identify patterns in approaches to heterothermy in birds and mammals by addressing questions about why some groups of endotherms employ torpor, why certain individuals employ it when they do, what the cues are that initiate the physiological response and why there is flexibility between individuals in their propensity to employ this strategy.  Over the next five years, my students and I will assess the importance of factors including inclement weather, food scarcity for reasons other than cold (e.g., seasonal drought), reproductive status, and day roost structure, on the use of torpor and overall energetics of caprimulgid birds and vespertilionid bats.  The cosmopolitan distribution of these groups and their variable habitat requirements, coupled with basic similarities in foraging strategies despite differences in sensory capabilities, make them good model taxa to elucidate the general influence of these factors on endotherms.

"A major method of analysis to be used in this research is the level crossing method, also known as the system point level crossing method (abbreviated LC). An LC analysis starts with the construction of a typical sample path (tracing or realization) of the process of interest. It then analyzes the dynamics of the sample path with respect to levels in the state space. Since its inception in 1974 by the present applicant, LC has become increasingly popular among researchers. LC has been used to derive probability distributions and operating characteristics in a large variety of stochastic models. It has also been adapted for non-parametric statistical inference. The research will also utilize other methods of analysis.

     The main objectives of the present proposal are as follows.

1) Apply LC to analyze challenging models that have been difficult to solve by standard approaches. An example is a model in Insurance involving heavy-tailed distributions for potentially extreme claim sizes, e.g., in floods or earthquakes. 

2) Combine properties of sample paths with Monte Carlo simulation, to evaluate convergent mathematical series for the probability density function of the waiting time in queues, the stock on hand in production/inventory systems, and related state variables.

3) Develop new LC techniques in combination with other solution methods of applied probability, statistics, actuarial science, and applied mathematics, to facilitate solutions. 

4) An additional objective of the research will be to define measures of flexibility and adaptivity for stochastic models. This will lead to a classification of stochastic models with respect to the flexibility and adaptivity criteria.  

5) Disseminate the knowledge gained from carrying out the research.

"The necessity for the development of new materials is the unceasing requirement for high energy conversion efficiencies for fuel cells and batteries and electrolyser applications in Canada. For this reason, an understanding of the fundamentals of many basic and crucial electrocatalytical reactions remains an important issue.    Of various systems examined, O2  and CO2 reduction as well as NH3 and short chain alcohol oxidation are of particular technological interest.  The most important characteristic is  the efficiency of the material used for the electrochemical reactions. Detrimental side reactions can occur, such as the poisoning effect caused by irreversible adsorption of products/intermediates of the electrochemical reactions. 



My research is focused on initiating a study of the kinetics and mechanisms of these redox processes at alloys, modified surfaces and well-defined surfaces for the elucidation and the understanding of the electrochemical phenomena involved in electrocatalytic processes (adsorption phenomena, electrodeposition and nucleation).   The kinetics of the electrode reactions will be correlated to the surface structure and nature of the substrate. Taking advantage of our custom made Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry system (DEMS) equipped with a  thin layer flow cell (interfaced with the mass spectrometer),  the catalyst surface state and nature will be modified selectively to study its role in the distribution of the reaction intermediates and products. This technique, which gives molecular specificity, permits the reaction products to be followed, on-line, concurrently with potential and time. Technologically, this research aims towards a better understanding of electrocatalysts and, ultimately, should lead to improved electrocatalysts for energy conversion and environmental applications.

"Les impacts les plus importants des changements climatiques se feront vraisemblablement sentir au niveau de la ressource en eau.  Au niveau des bassins versants, les impacts potentiels futurs sont g�n�ralement �valu�s � l'aide de mod�les hydrologiques.  Les mod�les hydrologiques sont des mod�les informatiques math�matiques qui visent � reproduire le cycle l'eau sur le bassin, et, en particulier, � pr�dire les d�bits en rivi�re.   Aux fins de se pr�munir contre les impacts n�gatifs d'un changement de r�gime hydrologique (ou pour optimiser les gains dans les cas o� ces changements seraient positifs), il importe d'estimer non seulement les impacts potentiels d'une modification du climat, mais aussi de caract�riser l'incertitude de cette estimation.  Au cours des 5 derni�res ann�es, divers travaux ont mis en lumi�re la contribution des mod�les climatiques, des sc�narios d'�mission de gaz � effet de serre, ainsi que des m�thodes de mise � l'�chelle vis-�-vis de l'incertitude des impacts futurs.  Dans la tr�s grande majorit� de ces travaux, l'incertitude li�e au mod�le hydrologique n'est pas consid�r�e ou est de facto suppos�e n�gligeable.  Quelques tr�s rares travaux r�cents permettent de jeter un doute s�rieux sur cette supposition et indiquent m�me que, dans certains cas, l'incertitude li�e au mod�le hydrologique pourrait �tre aussi importante que celles �num�r�es ci haut.  



L'objectif principal de la recherche est donc d'�valuer la contribution du mod�le hydrologique � l'incertitude globale de l'impact des changements climatiques. Trois axes de recherche permettront 1) d'�tablir la sensibilit� de diff�rents types de mod�les hydrologiques � une variation de climat, 2) de comprendre le lien entre les approches utilis�es pour tester leur validit� et la variabilit� climatique, et 3) de proposer une approche visant � quantifier et � minimiser l'incertitude li�e � leur utilisation.

"L'objectif de mon programme de recherche est d'int�grer la plasticit� de croissance chez les v�g�taux au ph�nom�ne de comp�tition, et d'en �valuer les cons�quences sur la dynamique de la v�g�tation. Dans un premier volet, nous comparerons exp�rimentalement l'intensit� de la plasticit� de croissance en r�ponse � la comp�tition chez un spectre d'esp�ces v�g�tales non clonales. L'analyse g�om�trique de l'espace occup� et les mesures de performance d'une plante en comp�tition permettront d'�valuer sa capacit� � compenser pour la proximit� d'un proche voisin. Dans un deuxi�me volet, nous d�terminerons la plasticit� de croissance en r�ponse � la pression comp�titive chez plusieurs macrophytes de milieu humide, comme Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia - Typha x glauca et Phalaris arundinacea. Celles-ci ont en commun de former des colonies denses et monosp�cifiques qui se maintiennent ou progressent gr�ce � une forte multiplication v�g�tative. La zone de rencontre entre deux colonies est donc le lieu d'une intense comp�tition intersp�cifique pour l'espace. Pour explorer la comp�tition entre ces esp�ces, nous utiliserons une approche exp�rimentale novatrice sp�cialement d�velopp�e pour simuler, en m�socosme, la rencontre de deux colonies de macrophytes. Ces exp�riences seront jumel�es � des suivis en milieu naturel, � la zone de contact entre des colonies.

"Les polym�res sont de longues cha�nes qui s'emm�lent, tel des spaghettis.

"It is difficult to overstate the importance of natural products to human health. The near doubling of the life expectancy for the average Canadian in the 20th century is largely attributed to medical advances based on natural products and over 50% of drugs approved by the FDA in the past 25 years are, or their origins can be traced to, natural products. Recent advances in biochemistry and molecular biology, that includes the development of high-throughput assays for rapidly identifying biologically active compounds, has enabled the discovery of many new natural products with a fascinating range of biological activities and structural diversity. However, due to often-limited amounts of material available from the natural source or environmental concerns associated with harvesting the producing organism, the full realization of these discoveries relies on simultaneous breakthroughs in synthetic chemistry, or total synthesis, necessary to assemble the biologically active compound in the laboratory. Thus, through total synthesis organic chemists provide a renewable source of the natural product, and generate sufficient quantities for unambiguous structural assignment and thorough biological testing. Bearing this in mind, the major focus of our research program is the total synthesis of natural products that represent potential lead candidates for the treatment of human diseases, and insect sex pheromones that provide earth-friendly alternatives to insecticides. These studies rely heavily on the development of innovative reactions that will allow us to construct complex natural products in a straightforward manner from simple chemical building blocks. In particular, we plan to develop reactions that will provide rapid access to haterumalide, a potential anticancer agent; hyacinthacine A5, a potential antidiabetic agent; and chimonanthine, an analgesic natural product. Our flexible syntheses of these molecules will also allow us to generate new substances, similar in structure to these natural products but with potentially improved pharmaceutical properties. The successful implementation of this program will enable discoveries fundamental to our basic understanding of organic chemistry and the development of pharmaceuticals.

"Metabolomics represents an emerging field of functional genomic research that has promising applications in drug discovery and disease prognosis. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) offers a versatile format for metabolomic analyses, which can also be used to study protein-drug interactions in free solution. Our group is interested in developing fully integrated strategies for metabolomics which combine sample pretreatment with chemical analysis in a single-step.  This offers the benefit of a rapid, automated and sensitive format for  metabolite analysis not feasible by conventional chromatographic or spectroscopic techniques.  The long-term goals of this research proposal address three major obstacles confronting current metabolomic initiatives.  



The first project is focused on developing quantitative models for accurate prediction of the relative migration time and relative ion response of metabolites based on their putative chemical structure using CE-mass spectrometry (MS) with computer modeling.  This will provide an improved strategy for identification and quantification of unknown metabolites in biological samples that is relevant to universal newborn screening programs for early detection of in-born errors of metabolism.  The second project will develop a label-free method for high quality screening of drug candidates for targeted protein by CE.  This work will provide deeper insight into the biological activity of putative drugs based on their impact on protein conformational stability. The last project is aimed at developing low-cost yet selective assays for routine screening of sugar metabolic disorders in biological samples without off-line sample pretreatment.  Our research program in metabolomics is unique in Canada that is based on both fundamental and applied aspects of chemical research that will have major impacts for disease prevention, early intervention and drug treatment.

"The present proposal targets the engineering of two processes to modify the surface of heat treated Al alloys through the deposition of a nanostructured Al-Si layer, in order to improve the wear resistance of Al-components. The results of this study are potentially of great value to the transportation industry, where lighter components possessing an improved wear resistance are needed. The present study is focused to

automotive engine components, exposed to dry sliding, such as the connecting rod. Nanostructured materials represent an attractive route due to the significant improvement in strength, hardness and wear resistance obtainable. Over current technologies, the proposed surface functionalisation processes present advantages

such as : (1) to be cost effective and have improved mechanical reliability and repeatability, when compared to bulk nanostrnctured materials and (2) to have metallurgical bonds at the interface and within the deposit, which results in improved mechanical integrity of the assembly when compared to thermal spray coatings.

Understanding the deposition process to develop a cost-effective nanostructured deposit and to study its thermal stability under simulated automotive engine conditions is crucial for its industrial implementation. The knowledge gained in this study will provide a real assessment of the potential service life of functionalised

Al-components for automotive application. The mains objectives of this project are to engineer two cost-effective processes to obtain nanostructured Al -Si alloys and to investigate the possible aging of the A1component during processing, to study the thermal stability of the components under simulated service condition and to determine the gain in wear resistance of the nanostructured claddings. The two proposed deposition processes are Electrospark Deposition (ESD) and Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). The results of this study will lead to solutions for the problems related to low wear resistance of Al-components and thus the surface modification approach brought by the present study will be appealing to the industries requiring this improvement in properties.

"The Canadian Road Map on Transformation Technology of Aluminum 2006 revealed that in order for aluminum to maintain its strategic position as a material of choice in all industries like the transportation industry, significant progress must be made in the development of high-strength, high-stiffness aluminium alloys and the development of cheaper processes for the transformation of Al. For the aerospace industry, this statement is critical since Al is facing competition from carbon-based composites. Alcoa, which is the major manufacturer of aerospace Al alloy grades, is well engaged in taking up this challenge and has recently developed a third generation of Al-Li alloys. However, the state of the art in alloy development requires optimization of the processing conditions, which is far from being achieved for these new alloys. This research proposal is to study three manufacturing processes: extrusion, friction-stir welding and freeforming, as well as studying processing variables for property improvement of two Al-Li alloys, namely 2099 and 2199. The know-how for these three processes was identified by Alcoa as critical prior to the alloy's utilization in aircraft components. This project is a joint effort by researchers from McGill and Laval University, two of the institutional members of REGAL and Alcoa.","A�rospatial","Services et syst�mes de transport","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Manufacturing",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"The present proposal describes a study of the combined effects of high temperature corrosion and wear mechanisms on the survival life of nanostructured coatings. The results of this study are potentially of great value to the oil and petroleum industry as the proposal also describes an approach to repair in-situ the corroded regions of nanostructured coatings used in that sector. In the coating industry, the traditional approach when faced with damaged or corroded coatings is to entirely remove the coating and to apply a new one on the fresh metallic surface of the substrate. This practice requires significant investments in increased manpower and in down time of equipment.

Understanding the behaviour of the coatings after they have been subjected to high temperature oxidant environments and mechanical stresses is crucial to appreciating how the Al depleted region will react during re-oxidation of the scaled coating surface. The knowledge gained in this study will provide a real assessment of the potential service life of nanostructured coatings. The main objectives of this project are to understand the formation of A12O3 under mechanical stresses for three Al-containing nanostructured powders. In addition, the applicants seek to develop two repair procedures aimed at increasing the service life of worn coatings and to characterise the extension to service life obtained by such repair procedures. Two repair techniques will be used, namely, Electrospark Deposition (BSD) and Cold Gas Spray Deposition (CGSD). The results of this study could lead to solutions for the problems related to manpower and equipment down time that damaged coatings create and therefore the coating life assessments and repair approaches that this study will bring about will be appealing to industries who use nanostructured coatings.

This project is part of a research program aimed at establishing a coating technology that will result in significant reduction of operation, maintenance and repair costs of tube bundles for furnaces and boilers used in the operation of the oil and gas industry.

"The major interest in nanomaterials, i.e. materials with a grain size distribution ranging from 1 to 100 nm, resides in the novel mechanical and chemical properties achievable compared to their micron-scale counterparts: superior static and dynamic mechanical strength, superplasticity, high strain rate flowability, enhanced corrosion and wear resistance. The possible gain in properties obtainable with nanomaterials creates an enthousiams in all technological sectors. The actual challenge preventing their utilization at large is the availability of processes to fabricate flawless large-scale bulk components at a competitive price. The near-net shape processing route enables significant material and processing cost reduction and reduces the possibility of introducing critical flaws during post-consolidation operations, which would help contributing to their commercialization and implementation. However, the engineering of near-net shape processing of nanomaterials is at its infancy and further understanding of the material's behavior and optimization of the processing conditions remains to be done. The present research proposal is therefore aimed at studying three processes to fabricate near net-shape bulk nanostructured materials: spark plasma sinter rolling, freeforming using electrospark welding and controlled short circuit metal inert gas welding. The two former processing routes will developed bulk nanostructured Al systems targeting the transportation industry, while the later will focus on nanocomposites for wear applications. This project will yield commercially viable processes capable of producing large-scale bulk nanostructured materials in geometries and at cost affordable to the industries.","Sciences des mat�riaux","Avancement des connaissances","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"For normal development to occur, genes must be kept off (silent) where they are supposed to be off. Silencing plays a vital role in development because it prevents genes from being turned on too early, or from being kept on.  Both forms of misregulation can lead to birth defects, or to cancer.  A group of about 20 proteins, called the Polycomb group proteins work together to make a the DNA of a target gene inaccessible to the proteins that turn genes on. We are studying one of these proteins, called Polyhomeotic.  In previously work previously funded by NSERC, a graduate student discovered that Polyhomeotic associates with a protein (Pds5) whose known role is in holding newly replicated DNA together before cell division. Another student has shown using genetic analysis that Pds5 has an unexpected role in silencing. One of the aims of this proposal is to determine the molecular role for Pds5 in silencing. In a separate study, my students have shown using genetic analysis that Polyhomeotic is required for normal cell division, and works together with Pds5. Very surprisingly, the stage of cell division where DNA is replicated is speeded up in Polyhomeotic mutants. Another aim of this proposal is to understand why this occurs.  The most likely reasons are that mutations in Polyhomeotic make it easier for the protein machinery to replicate DNA, or that mutations make more starting points for DNA replication available to the replication machinery.  Pds5 is recruited by the protein machinery that makes DNA. We want to test the hypothesis that Pds5 recruits Polyhomeotic to newly replicated DNA. To do this, we have to develop a system for purifying this newly synthesized DNA in a way that does not disrupt the interaction of proteins with DNA. This is the third aim of the proposal.  This research will identify the molecular basis for new role(s) for Pds5, and has the potential to provide important insight about the molecular mechanisms of silencing.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"Although it has been recognized for hundreds of years that mechanical forces must act in order for tissues to be reshaped into organs and other crucial structures during early embryo development, identifying when, where and how the requisite forces are generated has proven to be extremely challenging. Biologists have made remarkable progress, of late, in terms of identifying the genes and biochemical pathways associated with some of these tissue movements, but an understanding of the mechanics that underlie these motions is still urgently needed.



The objective of our research program is to develop an integrated multi-scale theory for the mechanics of embryonic tissues that is comprehensive, quantitative, experimentally verified and powerful enough to reveal, in detail, how specific morphogenetic events are driven.



In this quest, we will use state-of-the-art computer software that we designed and wrote in our laboratory to model the mechanics of embryonic tissues. We will also use unique scientific instruments that we developed to collect force and motion data from amphibian and chick embryos so that we could validate our models.



We anticipate that our theory will lead to fundamental insights into the mechanics of specific tissue motion patterns such as convergent extension and neurulation, processes that are crucial to normal spinal cord and brain formation.

"Every moment in every day life we notice symmetry or lack of it. For example, the symmetry of a face, or of the pattern of the tiles on the bathroom floor.  Or how all Mondays resemble each other. The cycle of life. Crime and punishment.



In mathematics (and in other exact sciences) we actively try to find and explain symmetries and work with them. And we also hope to quantify or to qualify them. We try to capture the essence of symmetry and use it as a tool of our trade. Symmetries are themselves objects, like rotations and reflections, and the collection of all symmetries is itself an object with a lot of structure, called a transformation group. 



The existence of symmetries of a structure has consequences, as can be expected. Internal symmetries in the material of a piece of silk are responsible for the special reflection of light on it. The hardness of diamond is a consequence of its organized and symmetrical structure.

The symmetrical nature of boxes has as a consequence that we can stack them easily. The rotational symmetry of a tire enables us to drive.



In the proposed research we study the symmetries and their transformation groups of some algebraic and geometric structures, often occurring in many different and often unsuspected places. And we attempt to draw the consequences for their numerical invariants.

"This proposal presents a unique opportunity for a multi-lateral inter-American collaboration on the fabrication, characterization and application of novel plasmonic materials for enhanced spectroscopy. The field of plasmonics is related to the manipulation of surface plasmons (SPs) waves by nanostructured metals.  SPs waves and localized surface plasmons have been recognized as the main contribution to surface-enhanced spectroscopic methods, such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEFS). In analytical chemistry, surface-enhanced spectroscopic methods provide an alternative for label-free detection of minute amounts of adsorbed species. The surface-enhanced methods are then a promising alternative for the detection of biological materials, as required for disease diagnostic and screening.  In this proposal, we will team up with excellent groups from South America that can provide complementary expertise to the project that will be developed in Canada. This project will lead to a high degree of exchange of senior scientists and students between the participant countries. These exchanges will expose researchers to different scientific cultures and, more importantly, will allow direct transfer of know-how and expertise among the participants.

"Our research program is centered on the development of metallic nanostructures and their applications in surface-enhanced phenomena, chemical sensing and spectroelectrochemistry (SEC). We are particularly interested in nanostructures that support surface plasmon (SP) excitations (either localized or propagating SPs) in the visible range (plasmonic structures). Recently, we have achieved the following important breakthroughs in plasmonics that will culminate in the development of new approaches for single-molecule spectroelectrochemistry (SM-SEC) and nanoelectrochemistry: 1) We observed single-molecule surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SM-SERS) from dyes adsorbed on an electrode surface and were able to control the single-molecule dynamics by changing the applied potential; 2) We demonstrated that nanoholes in metal films are sensitive to adsorption and support enhanced spectroscopy. We propose to capitalize on these breakthroughs by further extending the application of SM-SEC to redox systems and protein adsorption. We will also use the concept of ""in-hole"" sensing to study the electrochemistry of species inside the nanoholes. The optical properties of the nanoholes will depend on the oxidation state of the adsorbed molecules, which will be the basis for the SEC from the nanohole structures. Surface-enhanced SEC using shaped nanoholes will also be explored.","Sciences des mat�riaux","Avancement des connaissances","Anal. & Phys.

"Silicone rubbers are widely used in a variety of consumer and biomedical devices. Complex shapes for a variety of applications may be efficiently made using liquid silicone rubber injection molding (LIM). However, silicones are hydrophobic, water repellent materials. In certain applications, there would be a significant commercial advantage to prepare, in a single step, complex shapes with hydrophilic, water loving surfaces, or to create devices that have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic constituents, including surfaces. Targets include lubricious (slippery) surfaces that have a better 'feel' such as contact lenses that need hydrophilic surfaces for contact with tear film, but silicone-rich cores to facilitate oxygen transport; and surfaces that will contact biological fluids, such as wound dressings, where the wound contact area must be hydrophobic, but exudate must pass into hydrophilic domains. This project will combine the synthetic expertise of the Brook group, the ability to prepare high value functional silicones of Siltech Corp., with the injection molding experience of Silcotech North America Inc. to develop new processes and polymeric structures that effectively lead to one-shot molded silicone and silicone/organic structures aminates that have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic elements. Click chemistry will be used to prepare metal-free silicone elastomers,

"In many complex fields, people are given explicit rules and asked to learn to apply them. Medical diagnosticians, for example, normally learn rules from the first day of medical school. These standard, authoritative rules are clearly useful in learning to identify medical disorders, but they do not describe the dependence on particular perceptual appearances that is acquired during the course of learning. Further, they do not hint at the variety of acceptable appearances, and the amount of evidence required to complete a diagnosis is generally not specified.  Yet, these rules are presented at the best that can be done verbally. My research is aimed at understanding how this verbal knowledge is coordinated with the more perceptual knowledge that is clearly necessary to become good at diagnosis. More generally, I am interested in how general types of knowledge, such as induced generalizations as well as explicitly communicated rules, are coordinated with the knowledge gained with specific cases.","Apprentissage et �ducation","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"In the development of an effective therapeutic product, the synthesis and purification of the drug are only part of the process.  It is also important to consider how the drug will be delivered.  Liposomes or lipid vesicles are an attractive delivery system for administering functional compounds.  Liposomal systems are known to increase drug retention time and to reduce toxic side effects after administration.  One area of great interest is the use of liposomes in drug delivery systems administered by inhalation for a targeted, sustained and non-invasive means of delivering drugs to the lungs.  The microencapsulation of liposome-entrapped compounds in biodegradable capsules offers a possible means of drug delivery to the lungs with increased stability and drug retention. This research has the potential for treating diseases such as tuberculosis and diabetes more effectively and without painful injections.  Such benefits will undoubtedly improve the health and quality of life of the many Canadians who suffer from such diseases.  

     The goal of this research is to develop a novel processing route incorporating emulsification and spray-drying to produce microencapsulated liposomal drug particles with improved stability and controlled-release properties for inhalation.  This will be achieved by first establishing formulation and processing parameters for liposome formation and the entrapment of active compounds.  Biodegradable particles would then be produced by emulsification and spray-drying of liposomal solutions.  Key factors for assessing suitable manufacturing techniques include: the integrity of the drugs and liposomes after processing, whether the particles have characteristics suitable for inhalation and the rate of particle degradation and drug release.

"I am investigating how major features of a species' life history, such as number and size of offspring, age at maturity, longevity and iteroparity have evolved. My methodological focus is to examine how these features vary within and among populations and species. I have concentrated on turtles, snakes and frogs because these groups have extended lifespans in cooler environments. My approach is to combine long-term data collection with short-term experiments; in both cases the key is that I am testing hypotheses with long-term data on marked individuals. Such data allow me to compare changes in individuals over time with changes within and among populations. My primary study populations occur near their species' northern limits of distribution. Standard morphometric and demographic measurements are taken annually and responses to manipulations of temperature, moisture, food, population density and sex ratio are measured to test hypotheses that explain different patterns of life history. Currently, I am examining how temperatures control distribution, how sex ratio is maintained when sex is determined by environment, how females select mates and why some vertebrates continue to grow throughout their lives. I am particularly interested in applying my research to conservation of reptiles and testing how life history affects vulnerability of long-lived species to anthropogenic pressures. In addition, our long-term data allow us to test for effects of warming temperatures on specific demographic and life history traits.","Conservation et pr�servation",Environnement,"Evolution & Ecology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Much of computer graphics remains in the domain of the specialist since it requires an uncommon set of skills, both artistic and technical.   The digital designer must possess a natural aptitude for artistic aspects such as composition, colour, and visual flow, and also engage in esoteric technical tasks such as object transformations or non-linear manipulations. Yet, even for those with the requisite skill sets, many tasks remain complex and labour-intensive. The overarching theme of this research is therefore to reduce the complexity of graphical applications through semi-automation and the incorporation of aesthetic constraints, thereby facilitating the democratization of computer graphics.  Within this broader context, the proposed research will allow those working with spatial data, who may not possess artistic training, to semi-automatically create dynamic renderings of their data.  

     The past decade has seen a vast increase in the use of spatial data for analysis, research, planning and popular use.  This work will therefore be important as a facilitation of spatially-based knowledge to the broader public for decision making, education, and engagement.  Public communication is critical for many industrial and academic projects. For example, if one examines online materials available for large research projects, one finds that the primary vehicle of communication to the public is visual illustration, animation and images.  It is the automation of such visual presentations that motivates this research. Through automation, allocated budgets for visual media production could be reduced, and for smaller scale projects that lack such budgets, automation would enable the production of such materials.  

     To achieve these goals, I aim to design and develop algorithms for the simulation of illustrative rendering styles, for the presentation and enhancement of spatial datasets.

My scientific interests are in the biophysical mechanisms by which cells engineer these large-scale structures---in other words, the molecular basis of morphology. The subject of this grant application is the microtubule cytoskeleton. Microtubules are long, slender filaments from which the cell constructs the mitotic spindle, axonemes, and the cytoskeleton. These structures are not static. Rather, they are broken down and rebuilt as the cell undergoes differentiation and progresses through the cell cycle.

"The proposed research programme is the logical continuation of our work on fundamental gas dynamics problems at small scale. These have the potential to lead to important aerospace, automotive and biomedical applications. Using both theoretical and experimental approaches, this proposal is aimed at elucidating fundamental compressible fluid mechanics phenomena. Ultimately, these may lead to new concepts that may be commercially exploitable. There is great potential in this area as almost no microfluidics work has considered compressible fluid flow phenomena and most gas dynamics work has concentrated for the most part on the macroscopic properties of these flows. 



The requirements for the miniaturization of devices able to produce mechanical work from heat sources are such that the time scales associated with heat-loss mechanisms are reduced dramatically.

 Therefore, to counteract these loss mechanisms at small scales, the rapidity of heat release has to be increased and shock waves are ideally suited for this task. There thus exists an opportunity to create new mechanical devices in the micrometer to millimetre range, making use of shock waves and shock-assisted combustion. 



The short term objectives of the proposed research program cover the theoretical and experimental aspects of classical gas dynamics and detonics problems, but revisited at micron-size scales.

"This project is aimed at finishing the engineering development of innovative intradermal needlefree injection devices. These drug delivery platforms offer the potential to effectively, rapidly and economically deliver drugs and vaccines into the skin, in liquid or powder form, while eliminating injection pain and infection risks ususally associated with needles. Following the successful demonstration of the basic capabilities of this technology, this Idea-to-Innovation Phase IIa project is aimed at optimizing the design of those devices such that they can reliably deliver specific payloads to targeted skin layers. Achieving this objective is a pre-requisite towards successfully commercializing this technology with pharmaceutical/medical device partners.



In our patented devices, pharmaceutical substances, in the form of liquid or solid micron-size particles, are projected at high speed towards the skin, which enable them to penetrate to a certain depth where they reach specific tissues and/or cells in order to produce the required therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Our goal is to first demonstrate the potential of the devices themselves, from a technology point of view. Therefore, we want to fulfill key objectives pertaining to the design and engineering of our delivery devices:

1- Optimize the geometry and operating parameters of the powder delivery device in order to: - demonstrate control over depth of penetration and - maximize delivered dose.

2- Complete the engineering of a pre-commercial single-dose pre-filled disposable powder delivery device while fulfilling regulatory requirements and minimizing anticipated manufacturing cost.

3- Perform a successful in-vitro demonstration of the liquid delivery device.

4- Demonstrate a laboratory prototype for a multi-dose device.

"This project is aimed at the development of innovative temperature and pressure microsensor array systems for aerospace applications. Following the validation of the inventive concepts with large-scale experimental models, this Idea-to-Innovation Phase 1 project is directed at the ultimate miniaturization of these devices, using monolithic silicon-based microfabrication techniques. 



This novel patented microsensor array allows real-time simultaneous measurements of temperature and/or pressure at multiple spatial locations, using only two communication/power leads. Frequency modulation is used to multiplex the signals of tens of sensors through common wires. For every measurement, analog microelectronic oscillators generate the required waveforms at frequencies that are temperature/pressure dependent. These oscillators are powered with a common DC power source, and superpose their output signals by current addition into the power supply leads. The multiplexed signal can then be recorded using a single data acquisition channel, and is analysed in the frequency domain to obtain temperatures/pressures.



We are now at the stage of sensor miniaturization, which is the object of the present I2I Phase 1 proposal. The proposed project is thus a critical step in the development of the commercial device as it will allow us to achieve three specific objectives:

1- Demonstrate the capability to miniaturize sensor footprint using clean-room microfabrication processes.

2- Optimize analog oscillator design to increase multiplexing density by narrowing oscillator bandwidth and minimizing crosstalk.

3- Integrate the pressure sensing technology into the frequency-multiplexed sensor configuration.

"The Department of Physics at Simon Fraser University has a vibrant program in experimental condensed matter physics, with researchers working on: the growth and characterization of novel semiconductor and magnetic materials; magnetic resonance of hyperpolarized gases; Bose-Einstein condensates; trapped ion quantum computing; and the physical properties of quantum materials.  The apparatus used in most of this research has the common requirement of either very high vacuum, or the handling of high purity gases.  High vacuum is important for several reasons: it allows materials to be deposited, one atomic layer at a time, without contamination from residual gas; it allows extreme, unstable conditions, such as very low temperatures, to be set up and maintained; and it enables devices such as electron microscopes to study structure with atomic resolution.  In parallel with this, the delivery of high purity gases is essential to several applications, including the growth of custom-made semiconductor materials (used at SFU to produce the world's fastest transistors in 2001) and the operation of low temperature cryostats that circulate high purity mixtures of helium gas.  In addition to a world-class research effort, our condensed matter physics program makes an impressive contribution to training, having collectively supervised 198 trainee researchers in the past 6 years.



In order to achieve conditions of high vacuum and high purity, it is essential to have equipment for detecting and diagnosing gas leaks in these research systems.  The equipment requested here is a mass-spectrometer leak detector, a sensitive instrument that is tuned to detect helium atoms and can resolve the smallest leaks.  This equipment allows problems with vacuum hardware to be systematically eliminated, increasing the value of the research infrastructure by making sure it can be fully utilized.  The equipment currently in use in our department is 25 years old and has reached the end of its useful lifetime.  It urgently needs to be replaced.

"Society is currently reaping the benefits of the revolution in semiconductor electronics that occurred after the quantum behaviour of noninteracting electrons was understood in the early 20th century.  It is the hope of many researchers around the world that there will be a second revolution in electronic materials when we understand a far more difficult quantum problem - the behaviour of systems of strongly interacting electrons.  At this stage the challenges are fundamental: to understand how the important electronic properties emerge in systems of interacting electrons, and to harness these materials so that they can be tailored to produce the desired properties, in a controlled way. 

      The most prominent example of this type of material is the cuprate high temperature superconductors, which display many exotic and unanticipated properties besides strong superconductivity.  At present, the mechanism for the high superconducting transition temperatures is still uncertain. In addition, the nonsuperconducting state is an unusual metal that poses some of the greatest challenges to our understanding of electrons in solids.  

      The cuprate materials form one aspect of our research focus.  We have made particular progress recently in demonstrating the importance of so-called ""phase fluctuations"" in limiting the strength of the superconductivity.  In fact, many workers in the field believe that if these phase fluctuations could be tamed (a difficult task) much higher transition temperatures would be possible.

      Our group studies a wide range of interacting electron materials using two main experimental techniques: high resolution microwave spectroscopy; and scanning Hall-probe microscopy, in which a small magnetic sensor is scanned over the surface of a sample to locally image the magnetic field. This technique underpins a new and very interesting aspect of this proposal: to fabricate nanostructures from correlated electron materials and use this as a way to understand and control their properties.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Condensed Matter Physics",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"Motor learning is necessary to ensure rapid, accurate movements. The cerebellum is believed to be a site for the plasticity underlying the initial phase of learning, but the mechanisms involved in motor learning have not been fully determined for any vertebrate motor system. We propose to use a primitive system common to all vertebrates, the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), to investigate the brain mechanisms by which movements are perfected and memories are stored.  The amplitude, or gain, of the VOR can either be increased or decreased by experience. We propose to identify the contribution of specific types of cerebellar synaptic plasticity to VOR motor learning and to consolidation (and disruption) of motor memory. We hypothesize that cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is associated with gain increases, while long-term potentiation (LTP) at the same synapses is associated with gain decreases. Both pre-and postsynaptic mechanisms have been identified for LTP, but only postsynaptic LTD has been identified so far.  Thus, gain decreases (but not increases) may be associated with both pre-and postsynaptic changes.  We also propose that consolidation of gain decreases requires relatively more presynaptic memory storage. These ideas will be tested indirectly using simple behavioral protocols.  In a second, more direct approach, inhibitors of a well-established step in LTD (specifically, metabotropic glutamate-receptor antagonists) will be injected locally into the cerebellar cortex to attempt to prevent gain increases.  Inhibitors of LTP, such as cannabinoid agonists, will be used to attempt to prevent gain decreases.  Effects of the same pharmacological agents on memory consolidation and memory disruption will also be investigated.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Integrative Animal Biology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"As humans, we take for granted our abilities to form an accurate sensory perception of the outside world or learn new facets of a sensory-motor task that may be required on a day-to-day basis. For example, a new medical student will use their sense of touch to learn how to assess a patients' pulse, quality of breathing or perform a new surgery that requires dexterous maneuvering. In order for us to carry out these activities, the neuronal circuits within our brain must change by adjusting the strength of communication between existing connections or by forming new ones altogether. Although considerable progress has been made towards understanding how our brain changes, much of the work conducted thus far has been done in post-mortem tissue or using imaging techniques that cannot track the exceptionally fast responses of our brain in real-time. Consequently, very little is known about how tactile stimulation or learning can induce rapid structural and functional changes in the cerebral cortex of the intact, living brain. The primary aims of my research will be to use new imaging technologies that will allow me to visualize in the living animal, how the cerebral cortex actively processes tactile information or forms new circuits during sensory stimulation or whilst learning new tactile associations. Further, I will dissect the neurochemical and molecular mechanisms that trigger rapid changes in cerebral cortical circuitry. Performing these experiments will provide critical information regarding the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate rapid forms of sensory learning, habituation and sensitization. Furthermore, knowing how to tune or prime cortical circuits with a relatively innocuous form of tactile stimulation may facilitate the treatment of neuropathological conditions associated with aberrant cortical responsiveness (eg. phantom limb sensations, fibromyalgia, schizophrenia) or the recovery of functions after injury-induced disruptions to cortical circuits.

"Prey animals are often faced with the conflicting demands of the detection and avoidance of predators and a suite of other fitness related behavioural activities, including foraging, mating and territorial defence. The threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey capable of adjusting the intensity of the antipredator response proportional to the degree of perceived threat should be better equipped to balance these trade-offs. Such models assume that prey can reliably assess local predation risk, yet surprisingly little is known about how prey perceive risk or about the factors that shape these trade-offs. Recent studies in my laboratory have focused on the use chemosensory cues as reliable indicators of risk for a number of prey fishes and how these cues function in threat-sensitive decision-making. In a series of laboratory and field studies, I will examine how prey integrate multiple information sources (i.e., chemosensory and visual cues) and how environmental factors such as resource competition, group size and habitat complexity influence threat-sensitive decisions. I will also examine the role of variability in predation risk over time scales ranging over short-term (days or weeks), long-term (entire growing seasons) or evolutionary (multigenerational) durations plays in the shaping of threat-sensitive trade-offs. Threat-sensitivity models predict that individuals should be able to alter their behaviour in order to compensate for the costs associated with predator avoidance, though this remains largely untested under natural conditions. I will conduct long-term field studies to investigate this hypothesis. Finally, a great deal of recent research demonstrates that anthropogenic pollutants, such as acid precipitation, impair the ability of prey fishes to chemically assess local predation risks.  It remains unknown if prey can compensate for the loss of chemosensory inputs by either altering their behaviour patterns or increasing their reliance on other, non-chemical inputs.  By improving our understanding of how prey assess and respond to local predation threats in a threat-sensitive fashion, we hope to enhance the ecological validity of environmental assessment and management programs and fisheries stock enhancement efforts.",Environnement,"D�veloppement du nord","Evolution & Ecology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The first part of the proposed research centers on combinatorial polynomials, from graph colourings to network reliability and independence polynomials. Algebraic and analytic techniques will be used to not only bound network reliability, both in the undirected and directed cases, but also to examine the underlying combinatorial structures. Locating the roots of the polynomials will shed more light on the outstanding unimodality problems of the underlying coefficients, as well as provide more insight into a newly defined class of fractals associated with independence in both graphs and simplicial complexes. I plan to continue to investigate strongly connected reliability, a useful measure of the robustness of a directed graph. In particular, there is an associated new simplicial complex that has not been previously studied, and its properties may help to efficiently bound this reliability measure. A new approach will involve compressing the directed and undirected graphs first with appropriate wavelets. 

       Associated with every abstract simplicial complex are homology groups, and algebraic and topological properties of these combinatorial structures sometimes have import on unsolved discrete problems. The project will look at developing more of the broad connections between these, with applications to network reliability and graph colourings.

       I also plan to investigate applications of mathematics to music. Independence polynomials of highly structured graphs are related to counting consonant chords in equally tempered scales with n tones, and there are still open problems concerning this enumeration problem. A characterization of tilings of finite cyclic groups will be useful in generating rhythmic canons. More importantly, I plan to construct markov-like models for both melodic and harmonic aspects of songs. The models will take into account not only song structure but key modulation as well. The models will be of use not only for algorithmic composition, but also for authorship identification.

"Low-frequency (< 20 MHz) ultrasound (LFUS) is one of the most common imaging modalities in diagnostic medicine, primarily because it is safe, reliable, and real-time. In contrast, high-frequency (>20MHz) ultrasound (HFUS) imaging is a relatively new technique, with an order of magnitude better image resolution compared to low-frequency systems. Despite the improved resolution, HFUS systems are not routinely used in clinical practice. The main barrier preventing their adoption is that until recently, these systems were based on single-element geometrically focused transducers that produced images with a limited depth-of-field and slow frame-rate. In LFUS systems, drastic improvements in both frame-rate and depth-of-field have been achieved by replacing the single-element transducer with a transducer array and an electronic beamformer. This allows electronic focusing at a wide range of depths within the tissue and increased frame-rates. Consequently, there has been a great deal of interest in developing array-based systems for HFUS. Unfortunately, fabricating high-frequency arrays and their associated beamformers is extremely difficult. In particular, to produce a tightly collimated ultrasound beam at these very short wavelengths, array elements with microscopic dimensions are required. In addition, the high frequencies require that the digital sampling resolution of the electronic beamformer and speed of parallel signal processing be greatly increased. In 2009, the world's first commercially available HFUS array-based system was released.  The arrays for this system, however, are designed for use in topical applications in which relatively large apertures and packaging are of no concern. We are developing a much smaller HFUS array in an endoscopic form factor, specifically for imaging sub-surface structures of the ear via the ear canal. This proposal seeks infrastructure funding for a real-time 50 MHz digital beamformer. This will allow us to generate real-time images using the custom 50 MHz array endoscopes that we are currently developing using our recently established micro-fabrication facility. Real-time imaging capabilities with Doppler velocimetry are essential to furthering our understanding of inner-ear dynamics.

"Ultrasound is a safe, cheap, and reliable method of obtaining real-time images of biological tissue. The resolution of an ultrasound system is primarily determined by the operating frequency of the transducer. High-frequency ultrasound imaging systems have much greater resolution than conventional low-frequency systems and can typically resolve tissue structures between 20 and 100 microns in size at the cost of a limited penetration depth (< 1 cm). In spite of the limited penetration depth, this technology has great potential as an imaging technique for visualizing small sub-surface tissue structures. While high-frequency ultrasound has been successfully applied to intravascular imaging, ophthalmic imaging, and pre-clinical small animal imaging, it has not yet realized its full potential as a routine diagnostic tool. The primary reason for this is that as the transducer operating frequency increases, the dimensions of the ultrasound transducer decreases proportionally, making them extremely difficult to fabricate.  If these fabrication issues can be overcome, however, a great improvement in image quality can be obtained over the relatively unsophisticated high-frequency systems that are currently used. This could potentially lead to the routine clinical use of this technology and create many new clinical and commercial opportunities. 

This research program describes the development of a high-resolution array-based ultrasound imaging system, specifically for investigating tissue structures of the ear and auditory system. High-frequency ultrasound has the ability to revolutionize diagnostics in this field by providing in-vivo and real-time visualization of the micro anatomy in the middle and inner ear. The transducer arrays that will be developed will be small enough to be situated at the tip of an endoscopic probe which can be inserted into the ear canal and up against the round window membrane of the cochlea. The micro-arrays will be designed in order to maximize the image volume within the cochlea and use a novel analog electronic system to focus the ultrasound beam.

"In astronomy, we try to understand the origin and evolution of the cosmos. We study how matter interacts with gravitational and electromagnetic fields. It is common knowledge that gravity plays a huge role in cosmic processes.  For example, a gravitational field can be produced by objects that we can see such as stars, planets, moons, and galaxies. Indeed, it was the quest to understand gravitation and its role in the Universe that motivated much of Newton's classic works in physics. It is much less well known, however, that magnetic fields are also important in the evolution and structure of stars, galaxies, and other astrophysical systems. The fact that magnetic fields might be important in this way was only put forward in the 1940s.  Magnetic fields are produced by electric currents, and unlike with gravity, we can ""see"" neither the currents nor the field.  All we can do is look for subtle effects of both and try to infer what is happening. This is exacerbated by the fact that what we are looking at is invariably far away, and the signals we are working with are faint. Advancing our knowledge of cosmic magnetic fields is difficult. 



The Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS)  is carried out with a radio telescope located in the peaceful hills of the Okanagan Valley in southern British Columbia. There, seven radio telescopes work together to image our Galaxy at multiple radio wavelengths. The CGPS data is particularly valuable for probing the magnetic field of our Galaxy. My research project entitled ""Exploring Galactic Magnetism"", uses data from the CGPS, and several other international partner programs, to probe the structure of the Galactic magnetic field. My primary objective is to identify the topology (or shape) of the Galaxy's field. I am also exploring how the field affects the structure and dynamics of the Galaxy. In the long run, this research should contribute to our understanding of how magnetic fields affect the physics of galaxies, and possibly how galaxies evolve.

"Photoactive proteins are crucial for many processes occuring in microbes, plants, and animals. These include energy conversion and storage, vision and other photosensory functions such as movement or growth towards light, regulation of development, and synchronization of sleep with time of the day. 

   One of the families of photoactive proteins is especially versatile in terms of functional diversification. Vitamin A based proteins (rhodopsins or retinal-binding proteins) are found in various groups of living organisms and can perform multiple functions upon a slight modification of their structure. As new structures and functions of microbial rhodopsins are being discovered, we are trying to find the link between the two, studying mechanisms of their functioning by various biophysical and biochemical methods.

   As a result, we are hoping to establish structural prerequisites for important bioenergetic and photosensory processess as well as to reveal additional functions of microbial rhodopsins. Understanding how the sunlight can regulate microbial (bacterial, fungal, and algal) communities is important both evolutionary and ecologically.

"Can we use our hands to improve our vision? The term ""looking"" typically refers to vision, but looking is best thought of as a hands-on, multi-sensory event. Even when touch is uninformative (for example when you place your hand next to the text you are reading), the act of scrutiny often involves placing the hands on or near the object of scrutiny. The goal of my research program is (1) to systematically uncover the details of how we use our hands to influence vision, and (2) to describe the role that the motor system plays in supporting this behaviour. By learning about the ways in which the hands can augment vision, this research has the potential to reveal how movement, touch and visual information are coordinated and integrated by the nervous system. In matters of practicality, I think this research will useful to the physical and occupational therapists who teach people with brain injuries or disease to use new strategies to take advantage of their remaining visual and motor capabilities.

"My research consists of five major projects, all of which involve the behavioural phenotyping of mice. The objectives of each project are as follows: (1) How reliable and valid are mouse models of neurodegenerative and other diseases? When a genetically modified mouse is developed as a model for Fragile X disorder, Alzheimer's Disease, ADHD or other human disorders, how can we determine their neuro-behavioural abnormalities? We will use our behavioural test battery to test proposed mouse models to determine which of their behaviours are normal, which are abnormal and how their behaviours change with age. (2) How do the sensory abilities of mice affect their cognitive performance? Many commonly used inbred strains of mice have age-related visual and/or auditory impairments. We will use our behavioural assays to dissociate sensory malfunction from cognitive deficits so that we can determine whether a mouse is cognitively impaired (an Alzheimer's model mouse) or has a sensory malfunction (a blind mouse). (3) What are the effects of apparatus design and test procedure on mouse behaviour? We will study how the design of test apparatus and procedures for studying mouse behaviour in the Barnes circular maze, the set-shifting paradigm, the 5-choice serial reaction time task, Hebb-Williams maze and 8-arm radial maze effects learning and memory strategies and anxiety-like behaviour in mice. (4) How do neural changes in transgenic mice correlate with behavioural changes? When we find a transgenic mouse with behavioural abnormalities, we will investigate the neural basis of these abnormalities by examining the brains histologically with immunospecific stains for changes in cell survival, cell death (apoptosis), axon and dendrite size, number of synapses and for neurochemical activity (ACh, AChE, DA, NE, 5-HT). (5) What is the error rate in mouse behavioural experiments and how can errors be detected, measured and reduced? ""Laboratory effects"" account for a high proportion of the variance in mouse behavioural studies. We will examine experimenter, mouse, procedural and apparatus variables which lead to different results when the same experiment is performed at different times in the same laboratory.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Nova Scotia","Nouvelle-�cosse"
"Due to the far reaching consequences of the recent research results,  the proposed  research program we will continue to explore over the next five year deals with exploitation of an area virtually exclusively developed in our labs. In what appears to be a simple extension of metal ion catalyzed acyl and phosphoryl transfer processes, we have studied metal catalyzed alcoholysis reactions of carboxylate and phosphate esters in the light alcohols, notably methanol and ethanol. Metal ions such as Zn^2+, Cu^2+ and lanthanides such as La3+ as well as complexes of these greatly accelerate the methanolysis of esters, activated amides, phosphate diesters and phosphate triesters at room temperature and essentially neutral pH in alcohol. This has led to the development of effective, patented methods for decontamination of organophosphorus based pesticides and chemical weapons. In addition, recent results have shown that various dinuclear Zn(II) complexes provide accelerations of 10^12-10^14-fold for the cleavage of two series of phosphate diesters that are commonly used as simple models for RNA and DNA. In the proposed work we intend to investigate the mechanism of these very fast reactions using solvent deuterium kinetic isotope studies for the cleavage of the RNA and DNA models promoted by a set of mono and di-Zn(II) containing complexes in deuterio-methanol and ethanol. We will mount a major effort to understand a very recent finding in our labs where one of our dinuclear Zn(II) complexes, in ethanol containing small amounts of water, can accelerate the hydrolysis of a phosphate diester by ~10^17-fold. We will investigate the catalysis of cleavage of a series of beta-lactams afforded by these di- and mononuclear Zn(II) complexes as models for the Zn(II) class B1 metallo-beta-lactamases, which are currently of interest as pathogenic bacteria that produce these enzymes have a great resistance to therapeutic treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics.  This research program will provide training for several students and post-doctoral persons, and at the same time will lay the foundation for the development of several new catalytic systems that may find practical use for transformation of important biological and industrial materials.

"Environmental monitoring for a wide range of contaminants is increasingly important as human activities cause

greater stress on environmental systems. Water quality is of particular concern, as evidenced by an increasing

number of contamination events affecting drinking water or water sources. Currently, monitoring is infrequent

and expensive, and knowledge of contamination trends, even in drinking water, is seriously lacking. In

Canada, drinking water is monitored daily for microbiological contaminants only at the plant, and chemical

contaminants are checked only every three months.

My research program is targeted to detection of organic molecules in a variety of sample types, where the

molecules are sometimes contaminants of concern, and in other applications are secondary indicators of

contamination. We are detecting a variety of organic analytes, with a significant emphasis on polycyclic

aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), but a core set of analytical techniques and principles is used in all projects. A

fundamental step in most methods for analyzing organic compounds is the transfer of the analyte from the

sample matrix using a ""partitioning"" or ""extraction"" process. Sometimes partitioning is relatively non-specific,

such as in solvent extraction or solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME), and also in high-performance liquid

chromatography.

We will use these core techniques to develop new technology for detecting E.coli and other bacteria in water.  We will develop new polymer SPME coatings for fibre-optic components to be used in ring-down

spectroscopy based environmental sensors. We will developed a novel series of HPLC techniques which allow for isolating and determining the alkyl-PAH in oils. These will contribute to a completely new regime for characterizing environmental contamination in the future.

"At Queen's we have developed a new technology for microbiological contaminant detection in water. This work was initiated in direct response to the Walkerton tragedy of May 2000. Ours is the only technology which can test for E. coli and Total Coliform bacteria on-site and perform with higher reliability than current tests. This has the potential to dramatically improve water safety and monitoring capacity in Canada and on a global scale. The company Pathogen Detection Systems (PDS) was formed in Kingston in 2003 to commercialize this technology. In this proposal, we propose to partner with PDS to enhance the technology and to significantly expand the range of contaminants which can be detected. The state of the technology today is summarized as follows: i) A test for EC and TC giving a ""presence/absence"" (P/A) result is available as a prototype, with the combined test running in disposable (single-use) test cartridges in a bench-top, manual sampled instrument. ii) The P/A result has been certified and approved for use in Ontario (see below). iii) The test takes 18 hrs to declare an ""absent"" result, with positive samples (as few as one cell) normally detected in under 14 hrs. At the end of the proposed work period, we will have accomplished the following to the technology: 1) A faster EC and TC test, with single organisms normally detected in 10-12 hrs and an ""absent"" time of 14-16 hrs, and a more rapid EC-only test with single organisms detected in 8-10 hrs. 2) Quantitative testing capability, where a ""colony forming unit-equivalent"" (CFU) value is reported with The P/A result. 3) A

modified test to provide detection of any general microorganisms in a P/A sterility test, using the same technology platform, ready for validation and certification trials. 4) A modified test to provide immunoassay-based detection of various contaminants as per standard antibodies as commercially available, using the same technology platform, ready for proof-of-concept testing leading to validation. We will also train three students and a post-doctoral fellow who will become strong contributors to the environmental biotechnology sector, where there is currently high demand in Canada.",Maritime,"Services et syst�mes de transport","RPP Internal Decision Cttee","1 & 2","CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Ontario,Ontario

"People constantly modulate the pitch of the voice when they speak and when they sing. Modulation of vocal pitch is critical for the expression of meanings and emotions. For example, a rise of pitch, such as during a question, conveys a sense of uncertainty, whereas a drop in pitch conveys a sense of consensus or resolution. However, very little is known about how the human brain controls the modulation of pitch when people vocalize, and so I am interested in investigating this process using brain imaging techniques, most especially the method known as fMRI, or functional magnetic resonance imaging. One thing that is well understood is that the pitch of the voice is controlled by a group of muscles that influence the tension of the vocal cords. When the vocal cords are tensed, the pitch of the voice rises, and when the vocal cords are made to relax, the pitch drops. Hence, the control of vocal pitch involves a kind of push-pull mechanism between opposing muscles in the larynx (i.e., voice box) that affect the tension of the vocal cords. A first step towards examining pitch control in the brain is to compare the patterns of brain activation when people are asked to either raise or lower the pitch of their voice. Are there separate brain areas that control these two processes? My colleagues and I recently identified a part of the motor cortex of the human brain that controls the function of the larynx and hence vocal pitch. An analysis of the neuroimaging literature on speech and song shows that this area is the major vocal centre of the human brain. Having established the general importance of this area for vocal control, I would like to probe this area further and investigate how pitch is regulated by tasks that bias the system towards either rises or falls in pitch. This work has important implications not only for speech and singing but for speech disorders. Many neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, have devastating effects on the voice. In addition, fluency disorders such as stuttering are thought to have a definite neural basis. Therefore, an understanding of how the brain controls the voice has important applications to a host of diseases that affect the functioning of the voice.

"Our research uses a combination of experimental and computational approaches to investigate the primary processes of energy conversion in photosynthesis. Photosynthesis supplies almost all of the energy to all forms of life on Earth. We are following the initial capture of light by photosynthetic pigments, the transfer of the light energy to the photochemical reaction centers (photosystems) and the subsequent transfers of electrons that are used by photosynthesis to ultimately store the energy of light in chemical form. The photosystems which accomplish this task are made of pigment molecules and electron transport co-factors imbedded in a complex of protein subunits. Our unique approach to understanding how energy conversion occurs at a molecular level is to use computers to simulate all of the steps including the dynamic motions of every atom in both the pigments and the proteins. Our protein dynamic models allow us to see how all of the molecules move and interact as the process of energy conversion occurs. The detailed motions of the protein molecules are a key part of how the photosystems manage to hold onto the energy from the absorbed light and convert it with such high efficiency into first electrical energy and then finally chemical energy. We combine our computational approaches with powerful experimental spectroscopic investigations that complement each other. By using the computer simulations to model the experimental data we can understand the molecular origins of reaction center function. Our work focuses on photosystem II, the key enzyme responsible for the splitting of water and evolution of oxygen in photosynthesis. In addition to understanding how this important protein complex functions we are interested in characterizing the many regulatory mechanisms that control its activity and protect it from light induced damage. Our basic research is also important to future development of bio-based photovoltaic devices to produce clean energy.

"Consumer acceptability of meat is governed by how tough the meat is perceived to be.  The toughness of meat is determined by the amount of connective tissue or 'gristle' that is in the meat, with tough meat having large amounts of connective tissue.  Connective tissue in meat consists primarily of the protein collagen, which forms cross-links between its molecules to produce a fibrous network throughout muscle that transfers the force of contraction from the muscle proteins to the bone to produce movement in the live animal.  As animals mature, the complexity of the collagen cross-links increases, with cross-links that can be degraded by heat progressively replaced by cross-links that are heat stable.  As a result, modern animal husbandry practices produce young animals for meat.  This strategy has produced tender chicken and pork, but has not produced tender beef because very young cattle do not yield sufficient meat for the practice to be profitable. Consequently, only 30% of the beef carcass is tender enough to be pan-fried, while the remaining 70% is tenderized by mincing it into 'ground beef'.  Grinding beef tenderizes it, but also reduces its shelf-life, increases its water loss and increases its exposure to bacteria.  Beef can also be tenderized using enzymes to degrade collagen; however, these enzymes also degrade other muscle proteins and produce cooked beef that is 'mushy' or 'granular'.   The first objective of this research program is to characterize the structure of the collagen cross-links in beef from cattle of different ages and growth rates to see how the complexity of the collagen cross-links changes as animals age and grow.  The second objective of this research program is to identify enzymes that degrade only collagen and reduce its heat stability.  Understanding the cross-link structure of collagen, how it is affected by animal age and rate of growth and identifying how enzyme degradation affects collagen involved in complex cross-links is crucial to creating new processes to tenderize and add value to high connective tissue beef.  This research will provide new product differentiation strategies to Canadian beef processors and assist with increasing Canada's share of the global beef market.

"At least 10% of the population of Canada suffers from hearing loss. Hearing aids and cochlear implants provide some benefit, but speech understanding is not fully restored, particularly in difficult listening environments. A number of projects will be undertaken to better understand the effects of hearing loss on speech understanding, to develop improved hearing aids, and to understand the physiological function of cochlear implants. The first objective is the further development of a computational model of the normal and impaired ear. The current model is able to describe a wide range of physiological data measured in cats. However, there are some differences between the cat and human ear that could be important in the exact neural representation of sounds. Therefore, we will create a human version of the model, with model parameters modified to fit the available human data. The model of the ear can predict the effects of sound volume and hearing loss on human speech intelligibility using a model of speech processing in the brain. However, this model does not take into account the fine timing of neural responses, which provides additional information to that conveyed by the average firing rate of neurons. Consequently, we will investigate methods for incorporating spike-timing information into our speech intelligibility predictor. The model will also be applied to development of novel hearing-aid amplification schemes. Our investigations have shown that conventional hearing aids only restore the neural representation of speech on average, but optimal amplification is often not achieved for individual speech sounds. We will develop speech processing algorithms to more optimally restore neural responses for all speech sounds. Present models of the auditory nerve are unable to explain a number of phenomena observed in responses to cochlear implant stimulation. Recent physiological investigations of the auditory nerve have shown the presence of a number of ionic channel types not considered in previous modeling studies. The effects of including these ionic channel types in a model of the auditory nerve will be investigated, comparing the simulation results to data from physiological experiments using cochlear implant stimulation.

"Software verification is more or less an empirical process in today's industrial practice: Tests are applied to software in the hope that these tests cover most of the functionality and thus discover most (but certainly not all) of the bugs. Another approach is conformance testing (our interest): A piece of software is checked against a formal model (the specification) in a fully automated (and efficient) manner. In a first variant (model checking), the specification consists in a logical formula, which is checked against the implementation; in a second variant (model-based testing) the specification takes an algebraic form and is then compared with the implementation either directly or via systematic test suites.

   We note that the way we express the specification takes either a logical, or an algebraic, but never a mixed form. However, a mixed approach is often the best way to go in practice. We plan to continue recent work to unify the two variants, and so to induce practical applications of mixed specifications in the area of real-time systems (systems in which correctness implies not only correct output but also correct timing of the output).

   We also note that current conformance testing methods are based on finite state techniques. This is adequate for verification of hardware and communication protocols, but less so for complex application software. A second direction of our research is thus the investigation of conformance testing with context-free techniques.

   Real-time systems are ubiquitous nowadays, from traffic light controllers to the fly-by-wire systems found in all the commercial airliners. Often their misbehavior leads to loss of property and/or life. Our investigation into finite-state real-time conformance testing will ease the adoption of such techniques in industry; this will eventually lead to more and more robust implementations of often critical computing systems.  Our investigation of context-free conformance testing will extend the above benefits to a wider range of software systems; our research has the potential of eventually eliminating the dreaded Blue Screen of Death from our desktop machines and - most importantly - from critical computing systems.

"The proposal concerns rodent vocalization and the code used by animals in vocal communication. Brain mechanisms involved in the production of ultrasonic vocalizations in the rat and the communicative significance, or ""meaning"" of these vocalizations for other rats are studied. Two main types of calls in adult rats are studied: the long alarm calls and the short social calls. The objectives of the proposed research are (1) to provide evidence that each of the vocalization types requires activity of a different brain subsystem, which uses different chemical code. The alarm calls are based on the utilization of the brain chemical known as acetylcholine and the social calls on the chemical known as dopamine. Both of these neurochemicals are released in the brain from terminals of specific neuronal pathways. The project also aims at (2) identifying active brain cells, which produce and release these neurochemicals and are directly involved in production of vocalizations. In addition to that, (3) the proposal includes behavioural studies, which are designed to provide evidence that rats can clearly distinguish different types of their calls and can even recognize calls of individual rats within their group. Finally (4) the proposal contains plans for studies of individual development of vocalizations from infants to adults. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to extend these studies to other species, including man. This research has a potential to reveal brain mechanism of human infant cry and development of vocal expression of human emotions. It will also contribute to our knowledge of the evolutionary development of emotional coloration of speech in humans and non-verbal vocal communication in mammalian species.

"Liquid and glassy oxide mixtures are used ubiquitously in applications ranging from the mundane to advanced photonics.  One example is boron oxide and water.  This mixture is part of the flux needed to solder copper pipes, and it is commonly used as an effective flame retardant: while dry at room temperature, it releases water upon heating.  During these applications the material is in its hot liquid state, and our objective is to measure the properties these hot liquids.  Almost no experimental work has been done on hot B2O3:H2O mixtures, perhaps due to the need to contain several atmospheres of pressure from the released steam while carrying out the measurements.  Pure B2O3 glass is an ""inorganic polymer""; a whole batch of material is actually one single molecule, consisting of a continuous random network of covalent bonds.  If one looks at a ""snapshot"" of water at one moment, it is also a continuous random network of bonds, but in water the links are much weaker hydrogen bonds interlinking H2O molecules.  By continuously adjusting the ratio of B2O3 to H2O we switch gradually from one type of network to the other.  One of our objectives is to find the minimum amount of B2O3 required for forming a continuous network of covalent bonds across the whole sample.



We will also investigate the basic properties of two binary oxide mixtures that are important for high temperature and photonics applications: SiO2:GeO2 and SiO2:Al2O3.  Varying the composition of these materials is necessary to tune the optical properties.  We will make use of our unique experimental ability to monitor the melting of glasses (the glass transition) at extremely high temperatures with synchrotron radiation.  The energy efficiency of engines increases with temperature.  We will contribute towards developing novel high-temperature materials by searching for the glass with the highest melting point, starting with mixtures of SiO2 and Al2O3.

"A large part of the mathematical sciences is concerned with developing methods for finding solutions to various types of equations. The simplest kind of equation is the polynomial equation, where the variables are combined using just addition and multiplication. This is the oldest type of equation that was ever studied. One calls such an equation a Diophantine equation if one restricts to solutions that are natural numbers, integers, or rational numbers. Equations like this come up in many practical situations, such as in resonance problems, translating election results into seat distributions, and various questions about discrete configurations.



In general, it is a very hard problem to decide if a polynomial equation has an integer valued solution. In fact, it has been proved, in response to a challenge that Hilbert set in 1900, that it is fundamentally impossible to create a general algorithm (computer program) that decides if there is an integral solution to a given polynomial equation. In contrast, the answer to the similar problem for rational solutions is unknown.



For a special class of equations called curves, recent work has resulted in a method that can often decide whether there are any rational solutions in practice. We even have some reason to believe that the method might actually always work.



This project aims to improve the understanding of the rational solutions of equations describing curves and surfaces.","Sciences math�matiques","Avancement des connaissances","Pure & Applied Maths - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"The incidence of residue-borne leaf spotting diseases of wheat has increased with implementation of conservation and no-till production practices that retain crop residues on the soil surface. Septoria tritici blotch, caused by the fungal pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola, is a leaf spotting disease of wheat in Canada. Yield losses as high as 50% can occur under conditions that favor the pathogen. Most commercial cultivars of wheat grown in western Canada are susceptible to this disease. Burning of crop residues or use of fungicides can reduce losses caused by the pathogens. However, development of genetically resistant cultivars is a more environmentally and economically sound method of reducing potential losses. Resistance is controlled by a number of independent isolate-specific genes. The objectives of this research are to: 1) determine the chromosome location of the third Septoria tritici blotch resistance gene in Salamouni and identify molecular markers linked this gene, 2) determine the chromosome location of the Septoria tritici blotch resistance genes in the tetraploid cultivar Coulter and identify molecular markers linked to the resistance genes, 3) evaluate the effect of different combinations of resistance genes and their interaction to isolates with different virulence patterns 4) fine map Stb14 and Stb13 and proceed to map-based cloning of these resistance genes and 5) further characterize the differentiation in virulence of M. graminicola isolates collected in western Canada. In the long term the results of this research will advance our knowledge of the wheat- M. graminicola interaction and will assist in the development of more global strategies for production of resistant wheat cultivars.  In the short term, knowledge of gene location and availability of molecular markers for marker assisted selection will form a solid foundation from which breeders can effectively and rapidly incorporate resistance into adapted cultivars.  Resistant cultivars will reduce losses to producers. Reduced use of fungicides or burning of crop residues will benefit the environment and the general public.

"The proposed research program focuses on the evolution and systematics of early diverging lineages of tropical tree species belonging to the family Leguminosae (pea and bean family), subfamily Caesalpinioideae.  The objectives are to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this subfamily and to test hypotheses concerning the evolution of floral and vegetative morphology, rates of diversification and biogeography.  With nearly 20,000 species, the Leguminosae is the third largest and economically one of the most important of angiosperm families.  Traditionally the Leguminosae is considered to comprise three subfamilies, the Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae and Papilionoideae.  Of the three subfamilies, the Caesalpinioideae has been the most poorly studied taxonomically and phylogenetically.  These early offshoots of the Leguminosae are highly diverse in their floral and vegetative morphology and widely distributed in the world with a fossil record that dates to the Eocene.  They also encompass some of the first diverging lineages that include species which fix nitrogen.  Using molecular data derived from the chloroplast and nuclear genomes, and building upon our previous work in the subfamily, we will identify natural groups and determine relationships among genera.  This will serve as a framework for establishing a new, badly needed, classification system for the Caesalpinioideae.  This new classification will allow us to explore patterns of floral and vegetative evolution, biogeographic patterns, and molecular evolution.  Fossils will be used to document minimum ages of lineages, as historical points for testing biogeographical hypotheses, and as a basis for estimating taxonomic and molecular diversification rates.  The proposed research is central to an international collaboration aimed at examining relationships in this poorly known, yet ecologically and taxonomically important, early diverging lineages of the Leguminosae.  Our role is to provide a strongly supported phylogeny for comparative purposes with the aim of studying the evolution of pollen morphology, wood anatomy, floral ontogeny and nodulation in this diverse group of taxa.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Evolution & Ecology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The research outlined in this proposal is aimed at using a scientifically unexploited but economically important virus family, the Iridoviridae, to identify novel classes of virus-host interacting genes that will help identify previously unidentified cellular anti-viral pathways. We have chosen to look at virus-host interactions in the Iridoviridae for a number of reasons.  First, unlike the Herpesviridae and Poxviridae families, there is a lack of significant basic research into the biology of the Iridoviridae. Secondly, by examining new viral families, novel genes that target uncharacterized host anti-viral strategies can be identified.  Finally, many Iridoviridae have been confirmed as the causative agent of severe diseases in fish and wildlife, affecting aquaculture and wildlife conservation. To understand how the Iridoviridae family circumvents host defenses, we chose frog virus 3 (FV3), the best-studied member of the Iridoviridae family, as our model system.  The genomic sequence of FV3 revealed a gene, 75L that has striking homology to LITAF.  75L is an 84 amino acid protein that has sequence identity with the C-terminus of cellular LITAF, but lacks the N-terminus of LITAF.  Because of the similarities between 75L and LITAF, we hypothesize that 75L interferes with LITAF's function. Specifically, we propose that 75L functions in a dominant negative fashion, antagonizing cellular LITAF function by mediating interactions through the C-terminal half of LITAF but lacking the N-terminal binding sites of LITAF. Since the role of LITAF is unknown, our research into the function of this unique cellular gene will help explain the neurodegenerative disease that is associated with mutations in LITAF, as well as advancing viral pathogenesis.  Finally, the studies here will help understand how FV3 causes disease and may help management of viral outbreaks in natural populations.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Cluster algebras form currently a very active area of research in mathematics. These algebras have been defined in 2000 to study questions from mathematical physics. Meanwhile, many  connections could be established with various other mathematical disciplines like geometry, combinatorics or algebra.



Our research proposal is focused on questions that study the connection between the geometry of surfaces and certain algebraic objects, called string algebras. We aim at solving some of the problems stemming from mathematical physics, and also a very classical mathematical problem, formulated by Frobenius in 1913:



A triple (a,b,c) of natural numbers is called a Markoff triple if the sum of its  squares equals three times its product. The famous conjecture is that the largest of these three numbers uniquely determines the two smaller ones.

This includes gene expression analysis via DNA microarrays, as well as large studies of organisms in which individual genes have been deleted or otherwise suppressed.  The general biological payoff in such genome-wide investigations includes new insight into, for example, gene function and the generation of novel hypotheses to test in subsequent experiments.

"In the physics of string theory, the universe is a ten dimensional space. While four of the dimensions comprise the usual notions of space and time, the remaining six are curled up into tiny complicated geometric spaces called Calabi-Yau threefolds. Understanding the geometry of Calabi-Yau threefolds is central to both algebraic geometry and physics. In string theory, geometric properties of a Calabi-Yau threefold determine the physical properties of the particles (i.e. strings) that move through it. In algebraic geometry, Calabi-Yau threefolds play a special role in a variety of fields of study, for example Gromov-Witten theory, Donaldson-Thomas theory, and birational geometry.

      The Calabi-Yau threefolds of string theory are usually taken to be smooth spaces, but can also be mildly singular spaces called orbifolds. In algebraic geometry, a singular space can be replaced by a smooth space by a so-called resolution of singularities. A resolution of singularities that is compatible with the Calabi-Yau condition is called a crepant resolution. A guiding principle in physics asserts that string theory on an orbifold should be equivalent to string theory on any crepant resolution.

     There are a variety of invariants associated to Calabi-Yau threefolds --- their Gromov-Witten invariants, their Donaldson-Thomas invariants, and their Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. These invariants all have physical interpretations in string theory. The long term objective of this project is to make mathematical sense of the principle that string theory on an orbifold is equivalent to string theory on any of its crepant resolutions. In particular, I want to formulate, and prove in some important cases, the various Crepant Resolution Conjectures, namely the equivalence between the various invariants associated to a Calabi-Yau orbifold and its crepant resolution(s).

"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments allow researchers to gain insight into the structure and dynamics of molecules and materials with atomic-level precision.  This proposal requests a reliable, cryogen-free air-jet cooler to enable NMR experiments on solid samples at low temperatures.  This accessory is for the 900 MHz NMR spectrometer at Canada's National Ultrahigh-Field NMR Facility for Solids.  The new low-temperature capabilities will result in increased sensitivity of the NMR experiment, and enable new research in diverse areas, since the Facility is used by dozens of scientists from across Canada.  For example, research in the following areas will prosper: (i) characterization of chloride ion binding sites in ion channel mimics and inorganic materials; (ii) studies of clathrate hydrates and complex hydrides of importance to hydrogen storage technologies; (iii) studies of colossal thermal expansion in cobalt-based materials.","Sciences des mat�riaux","Avancement des connaissances",Chemistry,1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)",Ontario,Ontario
"Our research program employs nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study and understand the structure and properties of solid materials.  NMR relies on the same principle as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):  at the hearts of atoms lie tiny magnets ('nuclear spins') which, when placed in a large external magnetic field, respond to radiofrequency pulses.  By observing how the nuclear spins behave under this situation, we can learn a great deal about the molecular and electronic structure surrounding the atom.  We are specifically looking at atoms in unique bonding environments in inorganic and bioinorganic solids.  In Ottawa we are fortunate to have access to a world-leading 900 MHz solid-state NMR spectrometer.  This spectrometer allows us to analyze traditionally ""difficult"" elements such as chlorine.  We are pursuing the development and application of chlorine NMR spectroscopy of solids in order to improve our fundamental understanding of NMR interactions.  There are also several practical applications of chlorine solid-state NMR which we are pursuing.  For example, we are interested in being able to characterize the chloride ion binding environments in large membrane protein ion channels.  To be able to do this, we need to start by examining smaller peptide hydrochloride systems.  Another application is in the study of hydrogen storage materials like magnesium chloride-ammonia complexes.  We intend to apply chlorine, magnesium, nitrogen, and hydrogen NMR spectroscopy to observe and better understand the absorption and desorption of ammonia in this and related inorganic systems.  Another aspect of our research program entails the characterization of heavy metal-heavy metal interactions (e.g., silver-silver interactions) in order to better understand how NMR spectroscopy can be used to probe for these interactions in new materials of unknown structure.  We employ quantum chemical calculations of the NMR parameters we measure in order to corroborate our experimental findings, and improve our  overall understanding of the structural factors which influence the NMR observables.

"At carefully adjusted temperature and pressure liquid and steam phases of water have the same density, and water randomly fluctuates on all length scales between the two phases.  Systems that fluctuate on all scales are said to be at a ""critical point"".   Motivated by a conjecture that many different systems can be united under a small list of such laws, a primary goal of statistical mechanics is to calculate probability laws of scale invariant fluctuations.  The Nobel prize winning work of Ken Wilson in 1982 began a program called the ""Renormalisation Group"" aimed at the creation of a mathematical theory of these scale invariant probability laws.  This proposal will advance Wilson's program.  Since critical points unite many systems it is reasonable to start with the simplest representative cases, one of which is self-avoiding walk.  A self-avoiding walk is scale invariant in the sense that individual steps of a very long self-avoiding walk seen from far away are invisible and all that can be seen is a continuous curve that has ""wiggles"" on all scales. Thus we are initially focused on the question of how the end-to-end distance of a self-avoiding walk grows as a function of the number of steps.

"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a powerful diagnostic technique employed in functional medical imaging. Our overall objective is to significantly improve PET imaging to approach its ultimate capability which would provide neuroscientists and oncologists, for example, with superior systems for diagnosing and detecting disease and investigating disease mechanisms. To achieve this goal we will develop a PET system based on liquid xenon (LXe) gamma ray detectors that is significantly superior to existing PET systems in sensitivity and image quality. Higher spatial resolution (sub-mm in three dimensions eliminating parallax errors) and superior energy resolution with suppressed contamination of scattered gammas and random coincidences are achievable in a LXe PET system. To translate the research results into practice, we will evaluate the system in comparison with state-of-the-art commercial PET systems and perform PET measurements. In concert with industrial partners we will develop and plan future LXe PET systems for small animal research and human studies which can be economically commercialized.","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Collaborative Health Research Projects Selection Panel",2,"CHRPJ ","Collaborative Health Research Projects","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"The Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary represents a major divide in the history of life. Ediacaran biotas were dominated by soft-bodied organisms that are now considered for the most part to be unrelated with modern multicelular faunas. Ediacaran organisms flourished after a global glaciation that is presently known as the Snowball Earth episode. On the other hand, the Cambrian witnessed the rapid development of almost all modern groups of animals, including the rise of skeletal faunas, a major evolutionary innovation known as the Cambrian explosion. The majority of evolutionary studies on the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition have been based on the analysis of body fossils. However, the ichnologic record (that consisting of tracks, trails and burrows produced by animals) provides an independent line of evidence to calibrate the Cambrian explosion.  Many recent studies have stressed the anactualistic character of the Ediacaran ecosystems by showing that, unlike modern environments, these ecosystems were dominated by benthic communities that developed in direct association with resistant microbial mats. Sediment stabilization by microbial binding was a major factor in Ediacaran ecosystems. During the Early Cambrian, matgrounds became rare due to the onset of vertical bioturbation and were replaced by mixgrounds in an event referred to as the ""agronomic revolution"". Integrated sedimentological and ichnological analysis provides a glimpse into the ecology of these ancient ecosystems and is particularly relevant to understanding the benthic communities of the terminal Proterozoic-Cambrian transition. The aim of this project is to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of Ediacaran-Cambrian ichnofaunas. Planned activities include: (1) fieldwork in several Ediacaran-Cambrian successions, (2) revision of trace fossil collections, (3) construction of a database of Ediacaran-Cambrian ichnofaunas, and (4) study of modern biogenic structures associated with microbial matgrounds in stressed environments. Fieldwork will be done in northwest Argentina, South Africa, Spain, China, the Canadian Rockies and Kenya.

"Motor representations form part of our knowledge of everyday objects like calculators and spray-cans.  There is increasing evidence that such representations, determining our ability to hold and use manipulable objects, are invoked dynamically during language and perceptual tasks.  For example, spatial attention is modulated in unexpected ways when observers view graspable objects.  The computational role played by higher level motor systems in cognition is therefore of fundamental interest, as is the nature of the processes that determine a particular hand representation in a given task context.   Any manipulable object affords a range of familiar actions.  For example, we learn to pick up or move a pocket calculator with an inverted open grasp, but we learn to use it according to its conventional function by poking the keys with an extended forefinger.   I therefore distinguish between volumetric grasps, having to do with the shape and weight properties of an object for lifting or moving, and functional grasps, those hand interactions evoked when we wish to carry out an object's function.  I have developed a novel experimental method to assess the evocation of specific hand action representations to words, objects or sentences in real time.   This approach requires subjects to carry out speeded reach and grasp actions on an eight-element response apparatus.  Each element affords a unique action and subjects learn to produce a given manual action in response to a visual cue.   We then measure the influence of an object, word or sentence (a priming event) on reach and grasp performance, time-locked to the visual cue, yielding evidence on the nature and time course of the motor representations evoked by the priming event.  I describe a series of experiments designed to assess the time course of functional and volumetric grasp representations for pictures and words.  In addition, I wish to assess the role of hand action representations in spatial attention to manipulable objects.  This research provides valuable convergent methods that will clarify evidence available from functional imaging research and from neuropsychology.

"Dimensional scaling of many different types of materials and devices has been required to continue to meet the demands of the ever-increasing performance requirements. To produce advanced materials and devices, precise measurement on the scale of individual atoms is required. This type of measurement is required for many research areas, including, advanced silicon-based materials and devices, polymer-based devices for memory and sensor applications, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), photonic bandgap materials and devices, etc.. It is the acquisition of a Spectroscopic Ellipsometer (SE) system that is the focus of this proposal. The Spectroscopic Ellipsometer system is required for material and device analysis to facilitate the measurement of the thickness and the optical properties of thin films on a sub 1nm scale. In many applications these films can be made up of multiple layers. A Spectroscopic Ellipsometer is purpose built for analysing these type of film stacks. The fabrication and analysis of these films and devices will be carried out at the University of Manitoba. The equipment requested in this proposal will be used in conjunction with other analysis and fabrication equipment already in place in the Nano-System Fabrication Laboratory at the University of Manitoba. A few examples of the application of this system to research that is currently being undertaken at the University of Manitoba  include research into silicon-based materials and devices, the development of switchable photonic band gap components, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and conjugated polymer systems. 

     Precise measurement of the physical properties (thickness and particularly optical properties) of nano-scale materials is fundamental to the fabrication of the fabrication and utilization in new materials devices. The acquisition of this Spectroscopic Ellipsometer system is vital to the continuation of research advancement in these multidisciplinary research areas. The failure to obtain such a system will severely limit the full analysis of the materials and devices that may be produced. The requested equipment is not available in the department or at the University of Manitoba. Since this research required the use of the NSFL, facilities at other Universities are not at all practical. With the use of this equipment, in the NSFL, students, both graduate and undergraduate, undertaking research projects in these areas will gain a fundamental knowledge of the latest analysis techniques in material and device nano-scale technologies.

"In the semiconductor industry, the increased chip speed has relied upon reduction of basic transistor size. As horizontal device dimensions become less than 0.1um, some vertical device dimensions are reduced to only a few atomic layers. At these dimensions the standard scaling laws fail. One solution would be to introduce new materials into the silicon chip fabrication process. The proposed research undertakes the fabrication, measurement and analysis of some of these materials.

"For most of us the act of producing meaningful speech feels effortless and instant. This impression belies a multifaceted and complex set of mental activities that give us access to the meanings and pronunciation of words. My long-term research goal is to understand how that happens. One practical outcome from this research is that such an understanding would have the potential to assist people trying to help stroke patients recover from loss of speech relating to brain injury. 



The underlying assumption in my research is that a word is meaningful to us, in part because of the company it keeps. We know that cats have whiskers because we can see whiskers on cats but we also know because we hear or read the word whisker in close proximity to the word cat. In this view word meanings cluster together in neighbourhoods and this clustering is one way the brain organizes our knowledge so that we can get to the meaning of a word in the effortless and instant way that defines normal adult speech. The research described in this proposal tests these assummptions in normal college aged participants and in patient populations.

"An outstanding problem of modern theoretical physics is the striking contrast between two frameworks we use to describe physics at vastly different length scales of our Universe. Quantum mechanics prescribes a statistical interpretation to the motion of subatomic particles at shortest distances. On the other hand, Einstein's theory of general relativity uses the notion of the spacetime geometry as a basic to the interpretation of current astrophysical measurements. Though both theories have sustained remarkable experimental tests in their corresponding realms of validity, their apparent dissimilarity calls for a more fundamental description: a single unifying framework valid from microscopic to astronomical distances.

String theory at present is the only known theory with the promise of unifying the physics of subatomic particles and gravity. A characteristic feature of string theory is a description of its elementary constituents as being extended in one dimension, rather than being point-like. In recent years string theory witnessed tremendous progress which have led to new insights both for the theory of subatomic particles and for Einstein's theory of gravity.  Nonetheless, a truly consistent description of Nature as a theory of strings, is still missing. My research efforts focus on understanding quantum properties of black holes and the origin of our Universe, as described by string theory. Additionally, I'm involved in developing analytical tools in string theory that could shed new light on the strong interactions of subatomic particles.

Direct experimental probes in the subatomic physics of the quantum nature of gravity typically require access to energy scales well above the reach of modern particle accelerators. Thus, tests of any unifying theory at present are necessarily in the internal consistency of that theory's underlying theoretical framework. Recently, it was suggested that refined cosmological measurements of our Universe may serve as a magnifying glass into the stringy character of quantum gravity. Currently my research is continuing to develop these exciting ideas.","Sciences physiques","Avancement des connaissances","Subatomic Physics",3,"SAPIN ","Subatomic Physics Envelope - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"TUDA is a facility at TRIUMF/ISAC to detect charged particles emanating from reactions of radioactive beams with a stable isotopic target emphasizing nuclear astrophysics. The original facility was set up in collaboration with a group from the University of Edinburgh (the University of York joined later) and a group at TRIUMF. Detectors for these experiments, existing or proposed, have been largely provided by the British part of the collaboration, while TRIUMF and NSERC provided for the infrastructure an help with personnel. Besides the nuclear astrophysics program some nuclear structure experiments led by the Saint Mary's group are also performed at TUDA. The detectors for these experiments are provided by Saint Mary's. In May/June of 2008 the TUDA collaboration has successfully completed an experiment in nuclear astrophysics measuring the ^18F(p,alpha)^15O reaction as ^18F beams have become available at TRIUMF. Many experiments proposed by this collaboration particularly in nuclear astrophysics still need execution due to the slow development of radioactive beams. As for Nuclear Structure experiments Tuda has been and will be used for TRIUMF Experiments 1056, 1057, and 1147 involving scattering of ^8Li, ^9Li, ^9C, ^11Li not involving partners from the UK. Another experiment proposed is a measurement of the ^14C(alpha,gamma)^18O (S1152) reaction. As the ^14C is radioactive with a long half-life it is commercially available and we plan to run it from the OLIS off line ion source. This requires some dedicated equipment (a special roughing section with traps). We are about to propose an experiment to measure the ^26Al(n,p)(n,alpa) reactions using a TRIUMF implanted target and the DANSE facility at Los Alamos. We are also participating in an experiment at the KVI, Groningen, the Netherlands, involving alpha scattering on ^12C. Within the TUDA group a postdoctoral fellow (Goetz Ruprecht) is available and we wish to keep it so. This individual is also involved with the development of the TACTIC detector. Such a person has proven to be extremely valuable to set up and plan for all the experiments, we did so far. We also employ a graduate student in conjunction with UBC (P. Bruskiewich).

"We propose the construction of a detector for the measurement of low and intermediate energy charged particle reactions covering nearly the full solid angle. This detector, named TACTIC, will be a cylindrical time 

projection chamber with an electric field in the radial direction. The central region of the detector will contain the gas target. The central region is at a constant potential and is not visible to detection. Ions pass through a grid of wires leaving the central region. They will then produce a trace in the field region. The free electrons are drawn towards the anode by the electric field applied. However, on their way the electrons will encounter a GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) foil, thus amplifying the signal by a large factor. Signals registered at the anode strips will be digitized. The chamber will register full traces which includes directions, a full energy measurement and for each anode strip an energy loss measurement. An array of BGO detectors will be placed around the chamber for particle-gamma reactions. The anode strips will be divided in polar direction to allow for higher counting rates as well as for the detection of multiple particle reactions. The reactions so far proposed include measurements of the 8Li(alpha,n)11B, the 7Be(p,p)7Be elastic and inelastic scattering reaction, and a 12C+12C. Our tests have proven that the principle on which TACTIC is based is sound and the chamber feasible. We also have performed extensive GEANT simulations. A similar detector (BONUS) has been built at the Jefferson Laboratory and has been experimentally demonstrated to work. We request here construction costs, the necessary manpower and some travel money to build the final version of the TACTIC detector. With the seed money of this year, we were able to progress with the construction of a prototype detector that at present (Sept06)is under construction in the UK. In April, we expect to have this prototype detector available and some alpha-source and stable beam tests done. We are still lacking mainly in the area of the data acquisition system and system integration. Using the experience gained at the prototype detector, we plan to build the final detector, incorporating also the DRAGON BGO array.

"No two maple leaves are alike and neither are two snow flakes. However, nobody will mistake the former for the latter. This simple metaphor is at the basis of the deformation and classification theory of mathematical structures. Given an algebraic or geometric object that is specified by axioms, structural data, or equations, what remains of the structure and which aspects change if one (slightly) varies the defining parameters? The instruments and techniques mathematicians employ to answer these questions are contained in the ever expanding toolbox of homological algebra, which strives to classify that which is of equal shape or form, i.e. ``homological''.



A coarse classification is usually obtained through discrete invariants, such as a dimension that may correspond to the number of spikes of a leaf; a finer one may necessitate continuously varying moduli that can be numbers again or manifest themselves through simpler structures. The metaphorical analogue here could be the shade of colour of a leaf. A deep fact of nature is that snow flakes have six spikes and that nothing with sevenfold symmetry can ever be a snow flake. Homological Algebra aims at similar fundamental results: the hunt for invariants and moduli employs highly abstract concepts such as triangulated categories, deformation groupoids, or controlling differential graded Lie algebras, leading to structures that have a simple general definition, but are difficult to exploit in any given concrete case. One thus looks for more manageable secondary invariants, among them cohomology groups, obstruction theories or concrete geometric objects such as discriminants or Frobenius structures. Applications range from classification theory in Algebra to fundamental questions in Geometry and Physics.

"Wave energy converters (WECS) are a clean alternative energy source that has promise to buttress the existing generation infrastructure in Canada.  Ocean wave energy is highly concentrated compared to other renewable sources, often offering 15-20 times more available energy per square meter than either wind or solar, and Canada boasts a vast reserve along its coastlines. Like wind energy, wave energy has its own temporal characteristics, and the intermittent nature of this renewable source make it a challenging problem to find ways to exploit the resource.  The wave energy industry is a relatively new industry with only a few concepts near to commercialization, and Canadian technology development in this area is in its infancy.  Missing is a clear identification of how wave energy can complement existing supplies at institutional, community, regional, and provincial scales, and ignorance in this area is a barrier to the integration of ocean energy.  A justified statement of the economic and environmental benefits of wave energy could illustrate potential market(s) for wave energy and spur economic development in this renewable resource.

A conclusive evaluation of the economic benefits of wave energy conversion technology must address possible solutions to three technical barriers to wave energy integration: optimization and active control, or tuning, of WEC designs, survivability of the infrastructure, and efficient methods of servicing and interconnecting WECs.  The proposed research program seeks to leverage the applicant's expertise in nonlinear hydrodynamics, WEC design and tethered underwater vehicles to demonstrate technical solutions using numerical simulations and experimental trials.

"The Arctic is among the most fragile ecosystems on Earth; it is also under immense environmental pressure as the effects of global warming are felt most acutely at northern latitudes. With their diversity and potential for rapid population growth, arthropods can serve as barometers of environmental change. This proposal aims to document changes in Canada's arthropod fauna by capitalizing on the vast but underused collections derived from the half century old Northern Insect Survey (NIS) - an unprecedented initiative that sampled diversity at 72 arctic, subarctic and northern boreal localities at a time when climate change was not yet a global concern. Our overarching research objective is to understand how northern biodiversity has and is adapting to a changing environment. We will quantify arthropod biodiversity across three major ecoclimatic zones in northern Canada, and we will strategically select sites that were part of Canada's 1947-1962 NIS. We will mine data from the NIS, and linking these data with field studies in 2010-2011 will allow us to effectively document change and adaptation of northern arthropods; this provides an unparalleled opportunity to assess impacts of a half-century of changing climates on biodiversity. Observations of southern insects appearing in the Arctic captures the public's imagination, inspiring both curiosity and alarm. We must have rigorously collected data in hand to recognize when change has really occurred, and not rely solely on anecdotal reports, such as the episodic occurrences of 'southern' species far beyond their known range. We have four specific objectives as follows: (1) to test how and to what degree the structure of arthropod communities change between the Boreal, Subarctic, and Arctic Ecoclimatic zones, (2) to assess how northern arthropod communities have adapted to recent (50-60 yr.) changes to their environment, (3) to use cutting-edge molecular genetic techniques to aid species identification and to help elucidate longer-term patterns, and (4) to provide a sound foundation from which to launch future studies, including the participation of northern stakeholders through education and training opportunities.",Environnement,Environnement,"Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"Forests are precious to Canadians, and preserving their biodiversity is a key global priority.  To do this we must first document the species living in our forests, from the ground to the canopy. Only then can we understand the ecological process and ecosystem services provided by forests. My research focuses on the ecology of forest canopy arachnids (spiders and mites), and the overall goal of my program is to understand the mechanisms behind arachnid diversity in the treetops of beech-maple forests in SW Quebec. I will start by documenting patterns of diversity and see how these patterns are related to spatial scale, and to test if there are unique species found in treetops.  This will help to assess the way in which the arachnids from one forest may be connected to those from of a different forest. I will also focus efforts on understanding how dispersal links communities of spiders and mites and measure the ways these eight-legged animals move around in forest canopies.  Another key ecological process worth investigation is predation, since many birds feed upon insects and spiders living in the canopy, and spiders eat many plant-feeding insects.  I will therefore test if predation events govern assemblages of spiders and mites.  The currency of this research is species, and goal of the final section of my work is to train taxonomists and to describe unknown species occurring in the study forests, and preliminary work suggests there are species new to science living in forest canopies in SW Quebec.  

 Forest canopies influence the overall forest ecosystem, buffer against external environmental change, and represent an exciting biological frontier.  However, this system is vastly understudied in North-eastern North America, especially for the high diversity of arachnids living in treetops. Outcomes from my research program will include inventories of arachnid biodiversity, descriptions of new species, and a deeper comprehension of the ecological processes occurring in beech-maple forests.  My research will benefit students who are training to be good ecologists and taxonomists, ecologists and forest managers, and will allow Canadians to appreciate, benchmark, and preserve the wealth of biodiversity in forests.

"A gas chromatograph (GC) is requested to support the programs of six faculty members and their research teams at Dalhousie. The requested configuration incorporates an autosampler and a high performance oven to ensure rapid processing of samples and high throughput. It is also equipped with a flame ionization detector that has a large linear range and exceptional sensitivity for detection of a variety of organic compounds. The primary application of this GC will be in the characterization and quantification of fatty acids (FA). Such FA analysis will support research in a number of areas, including food web elucidation, investigating relationships between physical properties and structure, and identifying alternative fuel sources. The GC instrumentation requested will also be essential in determining a range of bioactives recovered from animal and fish processing waste, including nutraceuticals and products of the bioconversion of glycerol. In addition, the GC system will be used in the analysis of natural antimicrobials used to control the growth of food borne pathogens. Lastly, volatile components and oxylipins in brewing applications will be determined using this equipment. Thus, the GC system requested here will enable significant advancements to be made in the diverse research programs of the six applicants.

"My general research interests involve understanding lipid metabolism so that I can use lipids as a tool to trace carbon flow. Specifically, I am interested in the use of fatty acids (FA) in the study of carbon cycling and food web dynamics in the marine environment. FA are well suited to such studies because many dietary FA are incorporated into consumers with only minor modification to structure, making FA useful as indicators or biomarkers of their source. I propose to continue my ongoing work investigating the transfer of FA from prey to predators at low trophic levels, with the aim of developing a model to estimate predator diets. I will use two different types of information from FA data: 1) FA signatures. The proportions of FA in different species of prey are distinct and are passed to predators with only minor modification, allowing me to trace these FA signatures from prey to predator fat stores; and 2) stable isotopes of specific FA. The distribution of carbon isotopes within specific FA of prey species are usually different and are also passed to predators with little change, thus providing an additional tracer of source. Both approaches, however, require investigation into the subtle biochemical alterations that may occur in FA signatures or stable isotope ratios with digestion, deposition and mobilization in predator's fat stores. Thus, I propose to carry out a series of controlled feeding experiments with model predators of cod (Gadus morhua) and salmon (Salmo salar) to quantify any alterations in FA that may occur. With a clear understanding of biochemical changes, I can construct mathematical models to determine fish diets using FA information. These models can then be applied as part of a broader carbon-tracing technique that I am developing for application to the study of food web structure in a number of different environments. Specifically, I am interested in applying these models to ecosystems most susceptible to effects of climate changes, such as the Bering Sea and the northwest Atlantic, to detect changes in carbon cycling over time.

"Mammalian cell culture comprises a major platform for producing a number of high-value biopharmaceuticals,

including enzymes, monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), viral vaccines, hormones and immuno-regulators. This

proposal deals with the development of a novel based optimal bioprocessing methodology for the production of

Mab by the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line using fed batch culture. The optimization will be based on a

detailed model of the process that will describe both the extracellular metabolite fluxes and the signal

transduction pathways in the cell. The objective will be to find an optimal feeding profile and optimal operating

conditions, including nutrient and temperature profile, to be implemented during the fed-batch process. The

key issue for optimizing the system is the prevention or delay of programmed cell death referred to as

apoptosis. Previous studies have proposed only partial models of the system. Some researchers only modelled

the signal transduction pathways related to apoptosis whereas others only modelled the metabolic extracellular

fluxes during the process.

The current research intends to elucidate the mechanisms leading to apoptosis by accounting for both the

evolution of extracellular metabolite fluxes and their specific interaction with the cellular transduction

pathways responsible for apoptosis. This comprehensive mathematical model, to be used for optimization, will

be validated by experimental monitoring of the levels of metabolites, intracellular and extracellular proteins as

well as the proportions of viable, necrotic and apoptotic cells during the Mab production process.

It is expected that by investigating and addressing the interaction between the extracellular fluxes and the

signal transduction pathways realted to apoptosis, a systematic methodology for obtaining novel optimal

protocols for biopharmaceutical production will result. This will bring about a significant cost saving to the

public regarding currently expensive biopharmaceuticals.","Mod�lisation et simulation math�matique des processus naturels",Environnement,"Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario
"Optimization and control of chemical processes have become essential activities necessary to meet tighter environmental regulations and to make profits in the face of increasing energy costs and increasing globalization-related competition. The key requisite for achieving useful optimization and control solutions is the availability of process models that correctly describe the effect of decision variables, in the case of optimization, or control actions, in the case of control, on product quality related variables. However, models are never accurate so efficient optimization and control strategies must be designed to be robust or tolerant to model errors.

This proposal discusses the development of robust optimization and robust control methodologies and their application to several chemical processes. The proposed research work is divided into two main projects: project 1, robust optimization and project 2, robust nonlinear predictive control.

Project 1 involves the use of analytical bounds or empirical models combined with Monte Carlo simulations to quickly calculate the variability in different process variables to be optimized.  The emphasis is on reducing conservatism and computation time of this variability calculations since the optimization problems of large scale systems are typically highly computationally demanding or prohibitive. The robust optimization methodologies will be used to solve optimal tradeoffs between process design and control design of chemical plants and for model reduction of large scale biochemical models to be used for optimization. 

Project 2 involves the development of a nonlinear predictive control strategy based on empirical models identified from data. The control actions are calculated to satisfy a robustness measure with respect to error in the model parameters. The resulting controller is expected to improve upon the current linear predictive controllers. The controller will be tested by simulations of a cyclic operation of an exhaust catalytic system where the objective is to control NOx emissions by manipulating cycle times and fuel feed composition.

"My work largely focuses on symmetry properties of 3-manifolds and related objects.  Roughly speaking, a 3-dimensional manifold is an abstract notion of `space' suitable for describing a universe (devoid of matter) in several contexts.  A common example of a 3-manifold is the exterior of a knot, or the space surrounding a knot.  A knot is what you get when you tangle up a length of string, and glue the loose ends together.   In recent work I have described aspects of the `space of all knots' in terms of the symmetry properties of the exteriors of knots. In previous work I found `upper bounds' on the symmetries of knots, currently I am looking for the appropriate `lower bounds'.  Another of my current interests is algorithmic topology: algorithmic construction of canonical decompositions of knots, and algorithmic constructions of 3-manifold invariants.  This has led me to a basic question `which 3-manifolds can one find embedded in Euclidean 4-dimensional space?'   I am currently taking a computation-based approach to determine which 3-manifolds do and do not embed in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.

"This research will advance our understanding of fundamental phenomena in two-phase, gas-liquid flows.  These flows occur in many industrial processes where both a liquid and a vapour flow in a pipe at the same time.  Examples are oil and gas facilities, boilers, steam generators, condensers, reheaters, distillation columns, and nuclear reactor cores.  The primary flow regimes of interest in this work are slug flow and annular flow.  Slug flow is characterised by slugs of liquid separated by elongated bubbles (called Taylor bubbles).  Annular flow consists of liquid flowing on the pipe wall and a vapour flowing down the centre of the pipe.  An understanding of these flows is important to allow this equipment to be properly designed and thereby minimise the energy consumption of processes involving two-phase flow.  This work specifically aims to make fundamental measurements of the velocity field in these flows.  This type of information is extremely valuable when attempting to improve the performance of equipment in these applications.  For example, the velocity field is the quantity that ultimately determines how effectively a liquid transfers heat with a tube wall.  It also determines the power required to pump the mixture through the pipe.



These measurements will be performed with an experimental technique known as particle image velocimetry (PIV).  This technique involves mixing many microscopic particles into the flow.  These particles are small enough that they do not influence the flow.  Pulsed lasers are used to illuminate a plane in the flow with flashes of very bright light.  A special camera takes two pictures of this light sheet a short time apart.  Images of the particles appear in these two pictures and appropriate image processing software can be used to determine the distance travelled by the particles.  The result is many thousands of simultaneous velocity measurements in the field of view of the camera.

"The molecules in mammalian sperm must reorganise just prior to meeting the egg, in order to fertilise. This reorganisation is started by signals that the sperm receives which cause the sperm to change its membrane and change its internal reactions. The exact nature of the signal(s) is unknown, making it difficult to either protect fertilising ability in males with poor fertility or to preserve sperm for artificial insemination. One molecule called Na/K-ATPase is well known as an enzyme that moves ions across the membranes of many cell types, including sperm. We have recently proven that Na/K-ATPase is a signalling molecule like a hormone receptor, and its hormone has recently been identified, in muscle cells, as the steroid ouabain. We propose to determine how ouabain's signal is received and acted upon by sperm; what its role is in membrane changes that preceded fertilisation, and how the molecules surrounding it in its immediate membrane environment can be manipulated to better protect and promote fertilisation.","Gestion des animaux (maladies animales, reproduction)","Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","Integrative Animal Biology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"The research objective is to provide basic and enabling technology, through programming languages, tools and the runtime environment, to exploit concurrency on shared-memory  multi-threaded/core/processor computers. Computer Science has entered a new epoch where most computing devices have multiple processors, and most future programs will be written for applications running on low-cost, high-performance, commodity, parallel computers. Unfortunately, the level of understanding and necessary tools to develop this application domain is wholly inadequate for the average programmer. Without further advances, concurrent programming will remain an esoteric skill, inhibiting the full utilization and adoption of commodity parallel hardware.

Asynchronous call implicitly introduces concurrency, and futures are used to return results from an asynchronous call. I am developing a mechanism for dynamically selecting among homogeneous and heterogeneous future types, allowing conditional selectors and ""and/or"" operators among selectors. 2. Asynchronous exception propagation is a useful alternative communication among threads, especially if timely propagation is ensured. However, timely propagation is impossible for blocked threads. I am developing an approach for unblocking threads to quickly begin propagation of asynchronous termination and resumption exceptions. 3. I have identified 7 fundamental memory-allocator features used to achieve good performance. Each feature is being examined in isolation to make it easier to reason about memory allocator design and provide a common base for comparison of allocators. 4. I am developing a profiling tool to aid in understanding the dynamic execution of concurrent programs running on parallel hardware to facilitate debugging and performance analysis. 5. Many concurrent applications are I/O rather that CPU intensive (web servers). I am developing approaches to utilize network and CPU parallelism to build very high-performance multi-threaded web-servers.

"Precise clock generation/synchronization is an extremely important part in the design of today's increasingly complex synchronous systems. For instance, when digital video is transmitted over coaxial cables, it usually follows the Serial Digital Interface (SDI) protocol which has stringent timing requirements. Frequency variations caused by temperature, supply voltage drop, or any other environmental fluctuations can cause timing problems and can result in transmission errors. Accurate and stable clock sources are therefore extremely important in modern systems.



Clock generation/synchronization is typically done using analog/mixed-signal approaches, such as phase-locked loops (PLL) and delay-locked loops (DLLs). While these solutions provide good results, their design and verification process is usually long, difficult and requires a certain level of expertise. This is undesirable in a consumer market where the life cycle of a product is typically short. In an effort to improve productivity and reduce the time-to-market, several researchers have demonstrated purely digital methods of designing these same systems (eg. all-digital PLLs). In addition to these benefits, the digital designs are also technology-independent, are easily prototyped and are more robust to process and temperature variations. It is therefore significant to explore digital ways of accurately generating and synchronizing clocks.

"Our laboratory is engaged in the study of an important group of biological catalysts known as fatty acid modifying enzymes.  These proteins are widely distributed in all life-forms and modifiy fatty acid components via highly selective chemistry.  The primary focus of our research program is to understand the molecular mechanisms which control the functional outcome as well as the exquisite regio- and stereoselectivity of these enzymic processes. We have developed a series of probes for this purpose and these tools are now being used by several groups in Canada, USA and Europe to study related systems. We plan to continue our fundamental studies with special emphasis on those systems for which 3-D structural information is being obtained. In this manner, emerging trends in reactivity can be correlated with accurate active site models.  

Our research has potential applications in four important areas: 1) Desaturase-derived plant oils have an annual global value of approximately 80 billion dollars and represent a significant portion of the Canadian economy. The ability to add value to these materials  by altering the nature of their functional groups will enable the production of customer-defined oils destined for the chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic or food industries.  In principle, this can be achieved through protein engineering experiments and  the results of our mechanistic investigations should serve as an intellectual basis for future work in this area. 2) A number of lipidic plant constituents appear to act as species-specific defence agents. A deeper understanding of this highly sophisticated molecular warfare might lead to new strategies for  integrated pest management. 3) A mammalian desaturase known as SCD-1 have been implicated in the management of disorders related to fat metabolism such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and cancer.  Specific mechanism-based inhibitors of  this enzyme are now being sought in an attempt to modulate SCD-1 activity and to more fully understand its cellular role 4) Cyclopropane synthases contribute to the virulency of Mycobacteria - the causative agents of tuberculosis and are now considered as therapeutic targets. Detailed mechanistic studies of these enzymes are clearly warranted.

"This research program focuses on conception and design optimization of Sustainable Manufacturing Systems (SMS) and Reverse Logistics (RL) Systems. Sustainability is defined as the development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Reverse Logistics (RL) include all activities to collect, disassemble and process used products, product parts, and/or materials for a sustainable recovery. In this present era of globalization, the world is facing ever growing challenges to meet basic human needs in a sustainable manner. Innovative and significant solutions are required at all levels of society to address these complex and inter-related problems in the creation of a sustainable world. In view of these, the present industrial production and consumption culture will experience significant changes such as dealing with pollution and waste problems, decreasing non-renewable resource consumption, and increasing manufacturer responsibility for environmental protection. There is, accordingly, a need to change the traditional objectives of manufacturing. Industrial manufacturing was traditionally driven by the objectives of increasing efficiency of the manufacturing resources, quality improvement, and cost reduction. Whereas these traditional manufacturing objectives will continue to exist in the future, account must also be taken of the reduction in the consumption of natural resources, the impact on environment, and the integration of manufacturing within a framework of sustainable distribution systems. These trends will radically change the manufacturing system and the supply chain designs. These changes include the integration of recycling, disassembly, re-work, and remanufacturing in these designs. Furthermore, all these have to be considered within a larger framework of ""Reverse Logistics"" in the design and management of supply chain networks. Based on these, in this research program, analytical and simulation models of Sustainable Manufacturing and Reverse Logistics Systems will be developed and optimized. The interrelations between the designs of SMS and the RL systems will also be investigated.

"My proposed research program has two parts:



1. In many control tasks, an Artificial Intelligence agent needs to make decisions with incomplete information in limited time. The applications range from planetary rovers to car GPS navigation systems to security screening devices. Real-time heuristic search is an approach to real-time decision-making under uncertainty. To date, my research group has produced high-performance real-time heuristic search algorithms. I will build on my past research to develop state-of-the-art real-time heuristic search algorithms broadly applicable in industry. Additionally I will theoretically analyze their strengths and limitations. The benefits of this research program include better intelligent systems for the entertainment, education and security industries.



2. When given the opportunity to interact with their audience, human storytellers are adaptive.  Simple conversations and performances of improvisational theatre are both examples of situations in which the content or presentation of stories are dynamically adapted, either to facilitate communication or elicit a particular audience reaction. Although interactive storytelling has existed for thousands of years, its computational simulation has only recently begun to be explored; modern personal computers (and video games, in particular) provide the first technological medium in which both the presentation of a story (through video and sound) and the capture of audience feedback (in the form of keystrokes, mouse clicks, etc.) can be fully automated and interleaved. My research group was among the first to apply player preference modeling to interactive storytelling. Under the proposed research program we will continue developing theory and applications of interactive storytelling. The benefits include automatically individualized entertainment systems as well as training and education software that adapts itself to the trainee.

"Canada emerged from the twentieth century as one of the most heavily urbanised nations in the world. The pace of urbanisation, coupled with consumer choices regarding housing, employment, and transportation, places mounting pressure on governments to develop sustainable solutions to transportation and land use issues. Current transport challenges facing Canadian cities include: increased automobile use, energy costs and patterns of consumption, traffic congestion, and emissions associated with the movement of people and goods. At present, North American transport and land use planning and policy often reflects assumptions about relationships between urban form and travel behaviour. For example, urban planners and policy-makers increasingly look to Smart Growth principles centred on the organization and density of cities, and the availability of housing and transport options, as an approach to overcoming transport and land use challenges. Despite rising public consensus around the efficacy of Smart Growth, there is little evidence to suggest that broad-based application of Smart Growth principles will yield desirable results for Canadians. This research program involves both geographical information systems (GIS) software development and policy-based studies aimed at enhancing critical discourse on the effectiveness of widely publicized and accepted transportation and land use planning strategies developed to improve quality of life in Canadian cities and regions. Program objectives include: (1) development of map-based software for describing geographical patterns of human activities and transportation decisions and outcomes in cities, and (2) application of the software to study the influence of urban planning and transportation engineering on patterns of household activities and travel in Canadian cities. Policy-based research will focus on the diverse and rapidly growing Greater Golden Horseshoe Area, a vast metropolitan area in the province of Ontario that includes a mix of some of Canada's oldest and newest cities.

"The general objective of the research program is to develop new statistical tools to address current analytic problems in basic research in human biology and complex disease, at the levels of the individual, the family, and the population. I propose to develop statistical models and methods of data analysis that integrate the multiple sources of data and the inherent complex data structures in molecular biologic studies of the genetic and environmental factors that impinge on disease processes. New technologies for high-dimensional molecular measurement present new opportunities to refine analytic approaches to gene discovery and characterization and to gain insight into the underlying biology using statistical models. 



Studies of individuals and families using genome-wide sets of genetic markers typically form the basis of investigations directed toward the discovery and characterisation of genetic variants responsible for human trait variation. In the short term, the research will focus on models for CGH (comparative genomic hybridization) and CNV (copy number variants) data obtained from genome-wide array studies of tumours and their integration into subsequent linkage and association studies of families and individuals. Other types of genomic data, including measures of gene and protein expression will be investigated in the longer term. Integration of multiple sources of data in a statistically coherent way would allow for testing of more complex biological hypotheses and richer modelling of biological processes and complex data structures.

"Oil is the most valuable value-added product of canola and the quality of canola oil is a significant factor in the determination of that value.  A earlier review found several environmental and agronomic factors that impacted on the oil content and concluded that recent variations in oil content, chlorophyll and fatty acid composition of canola oil are due mostly to meteorological conditions and that further analysis of meteorological impacts on canola quality would be useful.  This study takes advantage of several existing databases with the objective to quantify the effects of growing season weather on canola quality for the purpose of canola quality prediction prior to harvest.  These databases include the Canadian Grain Commission harvest survey and a number of weather databases from stations located across western Canada.  Daily weather conditions will be reconstructed from the weather databases for the locations of specific samples in the harvest survey database.  The daily weather at each sample location will facilitate the calculation of a suite of weather-based parameters to characterize the precipitation regime as well as heat and water stress.  These will be used as independent variables in statistical analysis to determine relationships between specific weather conditions at specific times during the growing season to various canola quality parameters provided by the harvest survey.  The equations generated in this analysis will be available for testing to determine their reliability for predicting canola quality of future crops based on growing season weather and prior to the availability of results from the harvest survey.  A prediction of canola quality has significant value to the industry because it allows time to determine the most appropriate logistics for sourcing canola with the needed quality specifications to meet the demands of specific customers.  The more efficiently this can be done, the more money that flows into the grain industry in western Canada.

"Our interdisciplinary research program focuses on the chemical biology of complex oligosaccharides with particular emphasis on two specific areas; conjugate vaccines and molecular recognition events that employ multivalency and supramolecular effects. The NSERC discovery grant is used to support research for the discovery and development of robust chemical methods to create and chemically define novel, biological active, compounds with potential for drug development. 

The target conjugate vaccine antigens are microbial cell wall oligosaccharides and mammalian tumour associated glycolipids, especially gangliosides, lipid antigens that are known to afford protection against cancer when administered as vaccines. We are developing novel chemistry for highly efficient covalent bond formation between carbohydrate antigenic determinants and immunogenic proteins, while ensuring the antibody response is focused on carbohydrate rather than the tether that links the two parts of the vaccine. We employ simple synthetic substrates that closely resemblenatural lipid and apply in vitro or in vivo chemoenzymic synthesis to complete the biosynthetic transformation of our substrate into vaccine precursors.

We have developed novel concepts in the design of inhibitors to block toxin binding to cell surface oligosaccharide receptors and we are expanding this concept to include other cell surface receptors. The approach employs pre-organized heterobivalent ligands in a defined polymeric array. Their exceptionally high activity depends on their ability to bring together two proteins that bind weakly to one half of the ligand but strongly when both ends of our molecule are engaged by each protein. The increase in binding strength can approach a million to one billion. Practical applications include protection from otherwise fatal doses of bacterial toxin such as E. coli O157 and targeting of malignant cells. This design concept has numerous potential applications that are not limited to carbohydrate head groups. We are cognizant of these possibilities and will not limit our investigation to purely carbohydrate recognition elements.

"We will measure the optical properties of a large variety of compounds to gain a better understanding of the complex materials at the forefront of scientific and industrial research. Particular attention will be paid to substances that offer promising breakthroughs in the areas of renewable power production and increased energy efficiency. In fact a rather novel aspect of the proposed research is to uncover the origins of the exotic properties of magnetic materials, in order to make new devices. These advances are crucial due to the ever increasing price of fossil fuels and the threat of global climate change. Important contributions in biology, chemistry, engineering and physics can also be made by the versatile equipment employed. This one of kind laboratory will provide students with important design, simulation, and measurement skills. The proposed research provides ample opportunities to collaborate with researchers throughout the world, thereby providing students with the critical skills needed to handle the increasing demands of globalization. Therefore the proposed research as well as the personal that will be trained will greatly benefit the economy of Canada and the well being of its populace.

"High commodity prices created a strong impetus for feed manufacturer to focus on improving cost-effectiveness of fish feeds. Fish feed manufacturers have significantly reduced fish meal level and have been relying more heavily on more economical protein sources in their feeds. This increased reliance on protein sources with different (poorer) amino acid profiles has brought about the need to pay greater attention to the essential amino acids (EAA) requirements of fish. A critical review of the literature reveals very significant gaps in our understanding of amino acid nutrition of fish. There is a multitude of opinions as to the optimal levels and best mode of expression of essential amino acid (EAA) requirements for fish. This situation often limits the ability of feed manufacturers to meaningfully improve the cost-effectiveness of feeds and/or adapt feed formulations to a changing commodities market (e.g. relative low price of protein sources compared to lipid sources). The root cause of the conflicting views appears to be our poor understanding of the effect of endogenous (e.g., species, life stage) and dietary factors on EAA utilization and requirements of fish. The regulation of amino acid catabolism of fish may also be slightly different from that of monogastric terrestrial animals. The adaptation of models developed for swine and poultry to fish nutrition resulted in poor predictions, notably for large rainbow trout.

It is imperative to invest more efforts toward improving our understanding of EAA utilization and developing more rational modes of expression or calculation of EAA requirements for fish. The long-term objectives of the proposed research project will be to improve our understanding of the factors affecting the utilization of two key EAAs, namely lysine and methionine, and to generate information needed for the development more rational modes of expression or prediction of EAA requirements of fish. The project will focus on rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon, the two main fish species commercially cultured in Canada. The project will involve the training of two PhD students.

"Bone is a dynamic tissue with an amazing capacity to self-repair and remodel under normal loading conditions. However, trauma and other events like diseases (osteosarcome, tumors, etc.) require bone grafting to assist bone reconstruction and repair (BRR): in over 6 million reported bone fractures yearly in the US, at least 550,000 cases require bone grafting (American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons, 2005). In several of these cases, synthetic bone grafts need to be used. It is our postulate here that the preferred type of high performance BRR grafts is provided by nature. Bone is a hierarchically structured composite material4 formed of nanofibers containing a polymer phase, collagen type I, and a mineral phase, crystalline apatite nanoparticles, organized in a complex 3D structure (porous or dense, anisotropic or isotropic). An ideal biomimetic (i.e., imitating natural tissues) BRR graft should be physically, structurally and mechanically similar to bones, in addition to the conventional long-term stability, biocompatibility, and mechanical reliability. It is proposed to develop biomimetic nanocomposites (bioNCs) from synthetic hydroxyapatite and other CaP nanoparticles and biocompatible polymer with enhanced mechanical properties and bioperformance (biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, tissue connectivity, etc.). These bioNCs will then be formed into complex 3D shapes to be used for bone grafts and other BRR applications (bone fixation, osteoconductive surfaces for orthopedic implants, etc.) via different processes such as micro/nanofibers, foams and films with different characteristics (e.g., shape, orientation, open porosity, density, ...).","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Over the last decade, it has become evident that activation of cell death play a  role in skeletal muscle wasting. This idea has emerged from the consistent observation that cell death processes are activated under various muscle atrophic conditions including hypokinesia, unloading, denervation,  dystrophy, neuromuscular disorders and aging-induced sarcopenia. Understanding how and why this fundamental process is activated under these various circumstances is currently an important area of research in muscle physiology/biochemistry. Our research program aims to investiguate the role of mitochondria, more specifically of the permeability transition pore (PTP) in the activation of cell death. We have previously shown that mitochondria from denervated muscle become  vulnerable to opening of the PTP, an important event in the activation of cell death. Moreover, we have shown that the susceptibility of mitochondria to opening of the PTP varies across muscle types, which may have an importance in understanding how muscles will respond to disuse. The current proposal aims to 1) further establish the mechanisms underlying the vulnerability to PTP opening and its link with cell death following denervation, 2) determine the involvment of the PTP in less severe models of disuse in which the relationship between motor nerves and muscle is preserved and 3) identify the factors responsible for the muscle-type specific regulation of the PTP. This work will yield important new information that will enhance our understanding of the regulation of the PTP in muscle fibers, and its role in cell death signaling following denervation atrophy. It will also bring new insights on the involvement of the PTP in other forms of muscle disuse in which cell death occurs, including muscle inactivity, normal aging and neuromuscular disease.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Integrative Animal Biology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Intestinal malfunction severely affects the agricultural industry as well as the human population. Intestinal disease and diarrhea often results from exposure to a variety of microbial pathogens, including the Protozoan parasite Giardia sp. The disease caused by Giardia is commonly referred to as ""beaver fever"". Ample evidence suggests that Giardia is one of the most common parasite of companion animals and young livestock, and it has great potential for transmission to humans. Giardia is a very common cause of diarrhea in children and in travelers. The host-microbial interactions that govern the outcome of infection remain incompletely understood. The epithelial abnormalities responsible for intestinal malabsorption and diarrhea in giardiasis share similarities with those observed in other enteric disorders, such as bacterial enteritis, chronic food anaphylaxis, Crohn's disease, and celiac disease. Therefore, a better understanding of these processes in giardiasis may help unravel mechanisms implicated in a variety of intestinal diseases. Using complementary in vitro and in vivo Giardia challenge model systems, this proposal builds upon promising preliminary findings to identify basic mechanisms involved during microbial-epithelial interactions in the gut.

Three inter-connected topics will be investigated in the context of this proposal. 

 Aim #1 : To characterize the intracellular mechanisms leading to epithelial disruption and loss of barrier function in the intestine.

Aim #2 : To identify novel mechanisms of epithelial rescue from Giardia-induced programmed cell death and loss of intestinal barrier function.

Aim #3 : To assess how Giardia may suppress host pro-inflammatory signaling in the intestine.

The identification of fundamental mechanisms leading to the Giardia-induced loss of epithelial barrier integrity, and the characterization of novel epithelial cell rescue mechanisms and immuno-suppresive actions of intestinal microbes, will shed new light on microbial host interactions in the intestine.

"DNA markers are becoming more widely used to study animal populations.  Genetic markers act as tags that allow us to track individuals and their descendents over a long period of time.  I will use DNA markers to study North American populations of chickadees and woodpeckers and examine how historical movements led to the patterns that we see today.  My research focuses on how individuals isolated in ice-free refugia during the last glaciation expanded into previously glaciated areas as the climate warmed, and how their dispersal was affected by barriers.  By understanding how these species of birds were able to respond to the change in climate, we can start to create models predicting future responses to habitat fragmentation and global warming.  In addition, it will allow us to determine how effective barriers, such as the Rocky Mountains, are in preventing individual movement.  If the barriers restrict dispersal between populations on either side of the barrier, they will be isolated from one another.  Over a period of time isolated populations may give rise to new species.  Determining what these barriers are, and how effective they are at limiting the movements between populations will give us a better understanding of how populations are connected to each other.  The information that we learn from birds, can be applied to other species found in similar environments and species with similar characteristics.",Environnement,Environnement,"Evolution & Ecology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"In the last decade, nanostructured materials have taken great strides in moving from scientific curiosities to components of real-world applications.  For example, individual and arrays of metal nanoparticles can be used as building blocks to fabricate truly beneficial devices for biosensing applications.  However, there is much that remains unclear about these nanoparticles, particularly when it comes to controlling their reactivity and assembly.  The properties of these nanoparticles are intrinsically linked to the behaviour of the thin molecular films that surround the metal core. The purpose of this research is to probe the physical and chemical behaviour of these single-molecule thick layers.  We are particularly interested in determining how electric fields influence the adsorption and stabilizing abilities of these organic molecules.  We feel that if we understand the properties of the monolayers we will be able to control the properties of the nanoparticles.  Our approach could lead to an elegant means to produce new devices for the manipulation of light based on assemblies of nanosized building blocks.

"Canada has vast solar resources that are massively underutilized. Based on the amount of sunlight that falls on the country - its insolation - our solar potential is enormous, and at present, almost entirely untapped. In this proposal, we endeavour to remedy this discrepancy by producing inexpensive, high energy output solar cells through an approach based upon nanoscience. Based on very recent and sound economic studies, we propose to build nanostructured photovoltaic (solar) cells using nanoparticles made out of compound materials produced from elements that are cheap to extract, highly abundant in the earth's crust, and having the right repertoire of properties that render them extremely desirable for photovoltaic applications. Through a set of highly multidisciplinary collaborations and supporters with a team of researchers from the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, the National Institute for Nanotechnology, and Micralyne Inc. of Edmonton

Alberta, we will incorporate these nanoparticles into controlled layered structures that are multifunctional - one or more layers absorb light to form an ""exciton"" which is then separated by other tailored layers into the electrical charges that are harnessed to do work. Through the application of surface chemistry and nanoscience, critical aspects of the solar cell will be manipulated to improve device performance, always utilizing approaches that are manufacturable and efficient. Following optimization of nanoparticle synthesis and the controlled layering methodology, with our industrial sponsor, we will push forward with the scale-up of the solar cell processing approach to roll-to-roll manufacturing with the goal of preparing very inexpensive

photovoltaic devices. The program proposed here will result in a critical mass of highly trained scientists with skills in nanoscience, surface chemistry and engineering, photovoltaics research, and a honed sense of how industry translates results into commercialized products. Thanks to a close involvement with a highly successful local company, every step of the way, we anticipate many positive spin-offs, including training and product development that could have an important impact on Canada's energy future.","�nergie �lectrique","Ressources d'�nergie","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Alberta,Alberta
"Nanostructures continue to be the focus of intense research because of their fascinating properties that can be distinctly different form their bulk counterparts, and thus show great promise for a range of applications. Complex metallic and organic architectures are emerging as important building blocks for on-chip interconnects and active components in nanoscale electronic, magnetic, photonic, and biosensing devices, for instance.  One of the key ingredients required for these future applications is the ability to integrate numerous addressable nanostructures through assembly, patterning, and alignment on technologically relevant solid supports, such as semiconductor surfaces. The challenge lies in fabricating large areas of high density nanostructures, with feature sizes well below 100 nm, in an economically feasible manner.  While photolithography will justifiably remain a core technology with respect to the upcoming sub-45 nm generations on the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) Roadmap, cost considerations for mass manufacturing will be one critical constraint.  As a result, there is interest in the development of complementary patterning strategies that involve large scale self-assembly, for use as a soft organic template for nanostructure development. While block copolymer templating is suggested on the SIA Roadmap to be a potentially ""innovative technology"" for sub-45 nm feature patterning, there are still many challenges associated with their integration with silicon and other surfaces.

    In this proposal, we outline our long-, medium-, and short-term goals with respect to integration of block copolymer templated-patterning of technologically relevant semiconductor surfaces.  We propose the development and application of catalytic stamps, a tool produced via block copolymer patterning.  In a complementary vein, ""perfecting"" the self-assembly process will also be pursued, notably via a combinatorial screening of simple lithographically defined ""markers"" that will direct the self-assembled templates into structures with long range order.

"My research focuses on general topology and measure theory. Some of the research has a set-theoretic flavor, as both of these areas occasionally require the use of deep set-theoretic techniques. The method of forcing especially, since 1963 when it was developed by Paul Cohen for proving that the Continuum Hypothesis is not decidable on the basis of the usual axioms for set theory, has led to important advances in these areas.

One area dealt with in my proposal is measure theory, which is devoted to the study of methods for calculating lengths, areas and volumes and more general notions of a similar type. The problems that concern me have a set-theoretic flavor. Techniques from set theory have been successfully applied to similar problems in the past. 

Henri Lebesgue proved in 1898 that every real-valued function of two variables which is continuous in each variable separately is a limit of continuous functions. Separate continuity is a property of functions which occurs with sufficient frequency that knowledge of the deeper structure of such functions is potentially useful. Another area dealt with in my proposal is to extend our knowledge of this class.

"I propose continuation of a research program in which the long term objective is to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms that pattern embryonic nervous systems.  A series of studies are outlined in which I will test hypotheses on the embryonic origin of nerves, and the mechanisms by which Eph receptor and ephrin signaling guide migration of neural progenitor cells.  These studies are to be carried out in sea urchin embryos - a model for studies in neurogenesis.  My involvement with the sequencing and annotation of the sea urchin genome, experience with manipulation of gene expression, and a longstanding interest in neural development in urchin embryos makes this program unique.  I propose support for a program to train students in modern developmental biology in which the precise roles of cell signalling molecules can be determined.  These studies will contribute to fundamental questions of the role of cellular signaling in animal development.  Sea urchins show close molecular kinship with vertebrates, yet they have a remarkably different body plan.  Preliminary studies have revealed features that are shared with vertebrates providing an opportunity to contribute to our understanding of neural evolution.  This is an established program of high-quality research that has been demonstrated to be a stimulating environment for research training.  This research program will establish sea urchin embryos as a unique model for neural development with the potential to give new perspectives and insights to the function of Eph/ephrin signaling and evolution of neural development.

"The study of strongly correlated quantum systems is one 

of the primary activities in the field of condensed matter physics. 

Its fundamental importance stems from the fact that strongly correlated 

systems can not be understood as just sums of their elementary parts: 

new laws and new behavior emerge when these parts are brought together 

and interact. This concept of ""emergent behavior"" has originated in condensed 

matter physics and is starting to have impact in other branches of physics as well and 

even in other sciences.  

Strongly correlated systems are also extremely important technologically:

cooperative behavior of quantum particles leads to ""macroscopic quantum 

phenomena"", such as superconductivity and magnetism, which form the 

basis of modern technologies. 

The goal of this research is to advance our understanding of several 

important issues in the field of strongly correlated systems, with the particular 

emphasis on the properties of low-dimensional superfluids and superconductors.

This study will have an impact both in terms of advancement of fundamental knowledge 

and, potentially, for the development of new technologies.

"Hydrological extremes are important events that influence the design process for a variety of water resource systems.  Hydrological extremes, such as floods and droughts, have important social and economic consequences that must be considered in the design, operation and management of water resource infrastructure.  The proposed research will develop improved approaches for estimating the probability of occurrence associated with extreme hydrological events leading to better design and operation of water resource systems.  



The proposed research work will focus on two main problems.  The first problem relates to the determination of flooding probabilities for locations for which there exists little or no streamflow data.  Traditional flood frequency analysis techniques seek to estimate design flood events based on a data record of past flood events.  When this database is not available, flood information derived from streamflow records for similar locations is used to transfer information from locations for which extreme flow information is available to the location for which the requisite data are not available.  This part of the research work seeks to: i) develop improved approaches for identifying similar sites to an ungauged site of interest; and ii) evaluate the homogeneity of the available extreme flow information to ensure effective information transfer. 



The second research problem is the determination of the probability of drought events.  The analysis of drought events must consider the severity as well as the duration of the drought event.  The research will adapt pooled flood frequency analysis techniques for the estimation of drought event probabilities.  The research will focus on the copula approach for conducting multivariate frequency analysis that allows the determination of joint and conditional probabilities for severity and duration of drought events.

"A complete understanding of the intermolecular forces responsible for orientational order in liquid crystalline systems represents an interesting and incompletely understood problem in materials science.  Such basic knowledge is important for the comprehension of a host of problems in fields ranging from the industrial applications of liquid crystals to the physical basis of biological membrane structure and function.  It is our goal to use and develop nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in conjunction with theoretical models and Monte Carlo computer simulations as tools in the investigation of ordered fluids, with the hope of providing a much better understanding than now exists about these systems.  

      We choose small, well-characterized solute molecules to probe the anisotropic intermolecular interactions in liquid crystalline solutions.  The NMR of the solutes provides detailed information on their orientational order.  Our aim is to rationalize this order in terms of models for the anisotropic intermolecular potential.  

We examine some solutes for which the proton NMR spectrum is rather complicated.  We develop and use two- and three-dimensional multiple-quantum NMR techniques to aid the initial spectral analysis of such complicated solute molecules.  We are also working on methods for the automatic analysis of such spectra.

      In addition to orientational ordering in nematic phases we explore orientational and positional ordering in smectic A liquid crystals.  In addition, we use the power of NMR to examine the phase behaviour of lyotropic liquid crystals, in particular the nonionic system CH3(CH2)11(OCH2CH2)6OH / D2O in which the lamellar phase is claimed to contain embedded cylinders.

      Our long-range goal is a complete description, with a firm physical basis, of the interactions responsible for orientational ordering in fluid phases.

"Species and populations of animals differ widely in growth rate, fecundity and other life-history traits. Fundamental to understanding diversity in life-history strategies is the recognition that trade-offs exist among various traits.  The dominant trade-off is the ""cost"" of reproduction; that between current reproductive effort and future fitness.  For example, when feeding dependent young, parents may offset high daytime energy expenditure by reducing, among other things, immune function and/or overnight metabolic rate.  The physiological mechanisms underlying such compensatory adjustments remain largely unknown.  I propose to use captive birds to identify potential metabolic and hormonal mechanisms enabling reductions in overnight metabolism. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that may constrain an individual's response to increased daytime energy expenditure is critical to predicting how populations will respond to environmental perturbations. Frequently, poor environmental conditions can result in breeding birds being unable to meet offspring food demands, with potentially negative fitness consequences.  To better match their offspring to prevailing environmental conditions, parents appear able to modify offspring physiology, via signals during development (e.g., egg nutrient content or antibody levels).  The second major component of my proposed research is to determine how/when such signals might increase offspring fitness.  Using quail, I propose to test the effect of pre and postnatal protein limitation on the subsequent fitness of individuals when they are reared in variable environments as adults.  Parallel field studies will test whether geographic variation in pathogen pressure influences the levels of prenatal antibodies females transfer to offspring, and whether levels are influenced negatively by maternal stress.  If elevated maternal stress constrains prenatal antibody transmission, there may be negative implications for populations experiencing combined environmental degradation and the threat of emerging diseases.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Evolution & Ecology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Human error and suboptimal monitoring practices result in large financial losses and losses of life everyday.  The U.S. petrochemical industry has estimated that $20 billion/year is spent as a direct consequence of minor events that escalate into larger accidents as a result of human error, or of workers not detecting events and taking corrective action quickly enough.  In healthcare, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimates that on average every hospital patient in the U.S. is subjected to one medication error every day and as many as 98, 000 people die in the US each year as a result of preventable human error, making human error the eighth most common cause of death in the U.S.  As just one example, the IOM estimates that at least 25% of human errors in medicine would be preventable with better clinical decision support systems.  This research will develop better decision support systems that take into account human error and how humans work.



My past research has shown that we can reduce human error and generate better human performance when we design decision support systems that show the right information at the right time.  Knowing how to do that requires an understanding of human psychology, human work, and the complex environments where people work.  I have applied Cognitive Work Analysis with individual workers and found that we could reduce human error, help people to diagnose problems more accurately, and solve problems more quickly.

"The goal of this work is to develop quantitative, depth-resolved measurements in scattering media for both high and low concentration consituents. Variable scattering limits quantification of analytes in cell suspensions and tissue measurements. For high concentration components we propose to combine optical patterned illumination with near-infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics, to provide depth-resolved quantification. We will extend the sensitivity of detection for low concentration analytes using dispersed ultrasonically active micro-sensors, which change optical and ultrasonic properties upon analyte binding. The specific objectives to be undertaken are divided into two parallel efforts:



(1) Determination of optical geometries and algorithms for separation of scattering and absorption cross-sections in bulk scattering samples using light which has been optically patterned. 



(2) Development of ultrasonically active, micro-probes made from phase transition gel fashioned into small structures in a way that can be probed using ultrasonic compression and rarefaction. This work will provide the fundamental understanding of a new class of biosensors.



The proposed work will allow a better basic understanding of the interaction of scattering in spectroscopic measurements and aid in the development of a new class of sensors for low concentration analyte detection. In the future, methodologies developed in this project provides the basis for non-invasive and minimally invasive quantification for routine research and clinical use.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) research applied to games has a long tradition that

reaches back at least 70 years with Alan Turing's work on computer chess. The

advantage of studying AI algorithms in this area is that games are precisely

defined, relatively small when compared to real-world decision domains, and yet

sufficiently complex to pose tough research problems whose solutions can help us

creating machines of human-level intelligence. AI research has had its successes

in games like chess, Othello, backgammon, and checkers - where machines now play

on par with or better than the best human players. However, big challenges remain

- most notably in the ancient Asian board game of Go for which to date no machine

can match the strength of good beginners. Likewise, video game AI systems are

lacking learning, planning, and reasoning capabilities which results in weak

performance compared to human players.

  The objective of this project is to improve the decision quality of AI systems

in real-time decision domains by means of abstractions, look-ahead search, and

machine learning of search heuristics. Our application focus will be on popular

games in which beginners still outperform the best programs. The results of this

project will increase our understanding of fundamental AI problems and will have

considerable impact on the real-time control domain in general and the computer

games industry in particular, which is in need of credible computer controlled

agents.

"Silver nanostructured materials have recently been developed for use in wound treatment. These new

materials, which are made of equiaxed crystals that are less than 20 billonths of a meter in diameter, have dramatically

changed the lives of people with chronic wounds like pressure sores and venous ulcers. In the past some of

these wounds would not heal despite receiving the best available treatment, but when treated with

nanocrystalline silver they healed very well. Remarkably this same nanotechnology may one day benefit

people with diverse diseases like eczema, psoriasis asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. This research program

will look at nanostructured noble metals, including gold, silver and platinum, with a goal of optimizing their

structures to achieve various biological responses including control of inflammation. Researchers will use

sophisticated vacuumn equipment to create various types of nanostructured materials and then use advanced

chemical techniques to characterize the final materials. Biological activity assessments will also be made and

correlated to the nanostructure of the material so that the structure-activity relationships can be established.

This will allow researchers to optimize the materials nanostructure for various applications and make the

development of therapeutic products possible.

This work will keep Canada at the forefront of nanostructured materials research through the training of

graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. It may lead to the development of new therapeutic agents which

will benefit Canadians both by creating high tech employment opportunities in nanotechnology and by

improving their quality of life through the treatment of disease.","Sciences des mat�riaux","Avancement des connaissances","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"The use of medical devices is increasing over time due to a combination of new products becoming available and an aging and increasingly debilitated Canadian population. The main problem with medical devices is their propensity to become infected with bacterial or fungal pathogens. When microorganisms become attached to a medical device, they grow into a sugar-coated community of cells called a biofilm, that becomes highly resistant to killing with either antibiotics or disinfectants. Biofilm infections are common and difficult to treat with conventional antibiotics, often requiring removal of an infected medical device. Many microorganisms are also becoming resistant to our limited arsenal of antibiotics, so new approaches to preventing infections of medical devices are urgently needed. We propose to design a biomaterial that will resist microbial colonization, the first and essential step of biofilm formation. This biomaterial will be coated with chemicals designed to repel proteins (which assist microorganisms in binding) and to release the immune modulatory compound nitric oxide (NO). NO has the advantages of both speeding healing of tissue and discouraging bacterial adherence to NO-eluting surfaces. This biomaterial will be tested for its ability to discourage microbial binding while improving healing, without using antibiotics. We plan to test its mechanical and biological properties using a range of biophysical, biochemical and microbiological techniques, ultimately testing the safety of the materials in an animal model prior to translation to human use.

"The application of nanotechnology to drugs, referred to as ""nanomedicines"" has a high potential for technological and conceptual breakthroughs. The development of nano-sized drug delivery systems will ultimately allow us to target selected cells or tissues within the body and control the release of drug at that site, resulting in greater safety and effectiveness of the administered drug. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop novel, tumor site-directed nanoparticles for the local treatment of disease with either chemotherapeutic agents or cell-killing by heat. Our initial focus will be the synthesis, preparation and characterization of nanoparticles made of tissue-compatible polymers and loaded with the anticancer drugs, paclitaxel and cisplatin, for potential application in bladder cancer. Most patients with this cancer have superficial disease, affecting just the surface lining of the bladder wall. Current chemotherapy treatments using drugs instilled directly into the bladder are not very effective because the contact time of the drug with the bladder wall is only about 2 hours, before voiding occurs. We believe that modifying the surfaces of the drug nanoparticles with tissue-adhering groups should prolong the  contact time, increase uptake of drug into the tissue, increase effectiveness and potentially decrease unwanted side effects. We have assembled an outstanding team of collaborators who will develop, for example, nanoparticles that can co-deliver two drugs and nanoparticles with a gold coating that can be irradiated with light of a certain wavelength and will heat up and kill cancer cells.","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Our inventory of surface N2O emissions has expanded dramatically over the past several decades.  Despite the diversity of conditions under which surface emissions have been monitored, we are still challenged to effectively model N2O emissions in the natural environment.  Most studies have simply examined surface emissions, treating the soil as a two-dimensional body.  Understanding the three-dimensional nature of N2O production and consumption and the resulting surface and sub-surfaces fluxes of N2O are key to modeling this process.  This project will collect a series of high temporal resolution data sets to examine N2O production, consumption and emissions of soil profiles under field conditions and based on these findings examine some of the triggers of N2O production and consumption (carbon, water content and temperature) under more controlled conditions in the laboratory.  This work will enable the refinement of models of N2O production and transport in the soil profile and allow better prediction of the effects of management, climate and climate change on N2O emissions from ageroecosystems.

"In the early stages of developing an information system, systems analysts often create conceptual models.  Such models are primarily diagrammatic, and include constructs and rules that analysts can use to describe a domain.  Examples include entity-relationship models and business process models.  Conceptual models are vital because they help analysts to understand users' requirements and to communicate them to designers.  Research shows that understanding user requirements is the key to successful information system development. 



Although conceptual models are vital, research shows that they are often underutilized and used poorly.  The motivation for my research is that conceptual models will be used more often and more effectively if they can be made clearer and more understandable.  To this end, I propose to develop a theory-based method and modeling tool that will help analysts to create good conceptual models.  The research has four phases with each phase focusing on a different element of 'goodness' described in a theory of representation: clarity of semantics, consistency of semantics, quality of decomposition, and accuracy of dynamics.  

 

The research will involve theoretical work (applying theories of representation and ontology), design (creating and implementing rules in a system), and testing (evaluating the system).  



The intended contributions of the research are: 

- For research:  New methods for developing conceptual models, new evidence regarding the usefulness of conceptual modeling theories and principles, and a software tool that can be extended in further research. 

- For practice:  A tool that analysts can use to create conceptual models that are more clear, more understandable, and therefore more useful in practice.

"In the course of their research projects in gene and therapeutic protein delivery, polymer science and regenerative medecine, a group of researchers urgently require access to an instrument that will help design long-term storage methods of therapeutic formulations for gene and protein delivery. One of the most common processes used to convert solutions into solids in order to stabilize them for storage and distribution is called freeze-drying. The process consists of three main steps (freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying) that need careful optimization in order to preserve the physico-chemical properties of the formulations while reducing their residual humidity below 3% to achieve a good long-term stability of the products. This application for a freeze-dryer is the outcome of a concerted search for a system that will help optimizing long-term storage methods. Access to such an instrument will permit long-term storage of therapeutic formulations for in vitro and in vivo studies in the applicants research groups and will also permit distribution of these formulations to collaborators throughout the world. It will also pave the way to a scale-up of the formulations preparation method which must be combined with long-term storage. This system is urgently required to facilitate technology development and transfer to industry for eventual medical applications.

These nanosized objects will be created by understanding and exploiting the ability of oppositely charged polymers to interact and associate.

We have a longstanding expertise in the production and characterisation of a positively charged natural polymer, called chitosan, that is composed of glucosamine units. We have formed complexes of chitosan with DNA and shown these nanoparticles to be efficient in delivering and expressing the plasmid gene in cell culture. Here we aim to further develop this technology to delivery DNA and RNA molecules that are expected to be the next wave of biotechnology therapeutics. Basic studies to reveal the means by which these particles are formed and to control and characterise their properties are described. The results of this research are expected to provide novel methods to formulate DNA and RNA therapeutics that can then be tested for biomedical applications.","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Root system is probably the less studied part of plants. However, information on roots development is important in many sciences such as biology, forestry, hydrology/hydrogeology, geotechnology etc. Moreover, to evaluate efficiently the impact of root systems, specialists from different disciplines need to be involved. At UQAT, the collaboration between researchers (in forest ecology and mining environment) involved in four chairs (Industrial Chair NSERC-Polytechnique-UQAT on Environment and Mine Waste Management; Industrial Chair NSERC-UQAT-UQAM in Sustainable Forest Management; Canada Research Chair on Restoration of Abandoned Mine Sites and Canada Research Chair in Forest Ecology and Sustainable Forest Management) has started more than five years ago. The present proposal aims at pushing further this collaboration by acquiring a novel instrument that will allow a better characterization of root systems in the mining and forestry context.

More specifically, utilization of the proposed equipment (Polhemus FasTrack digitizer) will allow advancing the knowledge on roots development in covers installed to avoid pollution from mine waste and to assess the use of plants with allelopathic effects as bio-barrier . The equipment will also be used in the boreal forest to evaluate the effects of climate change on the growth of aspen and black spruce and to assess growth of balsam fir saplings under black spruce and aspen canopy. At the present, there is no alternative to the approach based on root digitizing to obtain quantitative information on root development.

"Acid mine drainage (AMD) resulting from oxidation of sulphide minerals contained in mine wastes is undoubtedly the more serious environmental problem of the mining industry. To avoid AMD generation, covers with capillary barrier effects (CCBE) can be built to limit oxygen availability for the underlying acid generating mine waste. Even if the performance of CCBEs has been demonstrated in the field over the short-term, the long-term efficiency still has to be proven. One of the factors that could affect the long-term performance of CCBE is bio-intrusion, more specifically tree roots. This project aims at evaluating the capacity of bio-intrusion barrier made of plants with allelopathic effects to limit long term deterioration of CCBE caused by tree-root invasion. Allelopathic effects (AE) can be defined as the inhibition of germination and growth of a certain species of plant, by the use of another. To reach the project objectives, three plant species with allelopathic effects: Bluejoint reedgrass, sheep laurel and bog Labrador tea will be propagated within 120 experimental plots (3m x 3m). Two-year seedlings of trembling aspen, balsam poplar, black spruce, speckled alder and willow (identified as the most problematic species for the long term stability of the LTA CCBE) will be planted in the experimental plots. Different approaches will be used to evaluate the impact of plants with allelopathic effects on the targeted trees: the evolution of morphological characteristics of the trees, roots architecture, chemical analysis of  plant tissue, soil and water. In parallel, the influence of the plants with AE on the CCBE water budget will be evaluated to see if the plants affect the performance to limit oxygen migration. At the end, the proposed project will give answers to some fundamental biological questions about allelopathic compounds and root properties interactions, as well as developing a practical approach for the design of bio-intrusion barriers on CCBE.

"The splash of a drop is a strikingly beautiful phenomenon, and one that most of us are familiar with, if only because such images are regularly incorporated into advertising.  What may come as a surprise is that scientists have studied splashing for more than a century, and yet the phenomenon is still not well understood, because droplets are small and splash quickly, and because the formation of the secondary droplets that form begins at or even before the moment of impact.

This work concerns itself with droplet splashing, which is of interest not only for its own sake, but because the impact of a drop against a solid surface occurs as part of industrial processes including pesticide spraying, spray combustion, ink jet printing, and a variety of materials processing technologies.  The efficacy of such processes is often related to what happens when a drop or spray of drops impacts a surface: do the drops splash or not, do they adhere or bounce off, and if they splash, how many secondary drops are formed, and of what size?

In this work we study drop impact and splashing using computer simulations that allow us to focus in on what's happening just beneath a droplet at the moment of impact.  We study the flow of air from beneath a drop, and how the air is squeezed and pushed out of the way as a drop lands.  We also study the impact of drops onto patterned surfaces - surfaces that aren't flat - to study how geometry and roughness affect the droplet at the moment of impact.  The long term goal of this work is to understand how splashing happens, and to then apply that understanding to industrial processes, to find ways to improve them.

"The objective of my ongoing research is to establish factors that affect the distribution, abundance and composition of organic matter in sedimentary rocks and the potential for  storage and production of gas in organic rich strata (coalbed methane and gas shales).  My research program integrates and applies novel experimental laboratory and analytical methodologies and study of recent organic rich deposits to the interpretation of ancient strata.   During the next five years the overall theme of my ongoing research program will continue but will further incorporate geomechanical studies with our recognition that the gas storage and flow properties of unconventional gas reservoirs is closely linked to the mechanical stratigraphy of the rocks. During the next five years my research program will comprise:

1) experimental laboratory studies will quantify the effects of pressure, temperature, stress and strain on diagenesis, fabric, permeability and diffusion rates and storage of gas in organic matter and mudrocks.

2) ongoing studies of  the sedimentology of black shales will expand to include evaluation of gas shale resources and those factors that effect gas capacity, content and sequestration potential for greenhouse and other gases (i.e. flue gas, hydrogen sulphide and oxides of sulphur).

3)organic maturation of shales and coals.  Documenting and interpreting the levels of organic maturation in Western Canadian Basin will be continued.  This research is directed toward using maturation data and numerical models to better understand the tectonic and thermal history of strata and oil/gas generative history.

4)investigation of the geomechanical properties of gas shales and coals will be undertaken in order to understand the interrelationship between shale and coal fabric, composition and mechanical properties and permeability and/diffusion.  These studies will investigate the complex interplay between mineralogy, fabric and pore structure and reservoir characteristics with varying effective stress.  Part of the goal of this work in to marry the lithostratigraphy with mechanical stratigraphy of the strata.

"Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary area concerned with how best to apply information technology to exploit the huge amounts of data in genomics and in related fields such as proteomics, systems biology, drug discovery, population genetics, and pharmacogenomics. Our aim is to make advances in the biological sciences and information technology. We do this by studying the needs of genomics, providing solutions for bioinformatics that draw on current best-practice, and identifying aspects of information technology that require improvement.



At Concordia, I work closely with biologists and biochemists to study fungal genomics. We search for new degradative enzymes within fungal species that will have applications in industrial processes, such as the pulp and paper industry, in biofuels, in environmental bioremediation, and in sustainable development. The fungal genomics work covers a broad range of bioinformatics from sequence quality control, sequence analysis and annotation, genome-to-EST mapping, proteomics,  biochemical pathways, protein families, and high-throughput assays for enzyme characterization.



Key areas of research in bioinformatics are the development of algorithms and software tools; the management and integration of data; the extraction and management of scientific knowledge; and the intelligent use of knowledge to answer biological research questions.



I am investigating all of these key areas in collaboration with colleagues at Concordia and across Canada with particular emphasis on database management, data mining, data integration and intuitive access; ontologies, workflow, and the semantic web.  As well, I am assisting colleagues with interests in natural language process to investigate extraction of knowledge from the scientific literature.

"The application of high external pressures on molecular solids using diamond-anvil cells (DACs) can lead to dramatic structural changes in the materials, e.g., phase transitions and changes in interatomic distances (bond lengths and bond angles), electronic distributions in molecular orbitals (e.g., pi-backbonding), hydrogen bonding interactions, and relative energies of molecular orbitals often leading to piezochromism - color changes induced by pressure - a phenomenon employed in some pressure sensors. By using commercially available DACs, pressures up to about 100 kbar (ca. 100,000 atm), i.e., approaching the geological realm, can readily be achieved in the laboratory and any structural changes occurring can be conveniently monitored by a wide variety of molecular spectroscopic techniques, e.g., infrared, Raman, UV-visible, luminescence, Mossbauer, etc., as the pressure is steadily increased. In the operation of a DAC, two gemstone quality diamonds (culets, ~0.6 mm) are squeezed together mechanically by means of a sensitive screw mechanism and the material under investigation is placed, using an optical microscope, into a very small hole (300-micron diameter) drilled in the centre of a thin (300 micron), stainless-steel gasket located between the two diamonds. The whole hand-sized device is then placed under the microscope objective of an infrared or Raman microprobe spectrometer. The chief aim of our high-pressure DAC research is to examine spectroscopically whether or not structural changes can be induced in a range of solid inorganic (e.g., clays and other minerals), organic (e.g., drug polymorphs) and organometallic materials upon the application and subsequent release of high external pressures. In some cases, the densification effect of pressure may lead to the synthesis of completely new materials. In others, important information about chemical bonding interactions can be extracted. The high-pressure work proposed on clay minerals, for example, may contribute in providing a clearer understanding of the chemistry occurring in the Earth's crust and mantle, and perhaps even what role clay minerals may play in triggering earthquakes.

"The use of electrical signals induced by seismic waves to explore for earth resources has attracted the interest of many research groups around the world since the mid-1990's. While seismoelectric signals are dependent upon a variety of physical properties, it is their potential to give information on pore fluids and fluid flow permeability with the resolution of seismic methods that has motivated interest in their measurement for applications in hydrogeology and hydrocarbon exploration. The electrokinetic coupling mechanism that has received most attention arises from disturbance of the electrical double layer that lies at the interface between the fluid and solid phases in porous and fractured media.

    The overall objective of the proposed research is to build upon recent experimental and theoretical studies to investigate applications of seismoelectric methods in porous and fractured media. Issues of special interest include identification of the types of interfaces most amenable to detection and the estimation of hydraulic and pore fluid properties from measurements of co-seismic effects in boreholes. Seismoelectric field experiments will be carried out at well-characterized sites using a variety of surface and borehole geometries to test the predictions of theoretical models, and we will experiment with the reciprocal 'electric-in seismic-out'  approach that has recently been demonstrated by Exxon-Mobil researchers.

    This research program will also provide basic infrastructure support required to investigate applications of more conventional electrical methods to aquifer characterization. The study of fracture network heterogeneity and anisotropy in bedrock aquifers is of particular interest given its importance in rural Atlantic Canada.

    Most field experiments will focus on shallow targets of hydrogeological or geotechnical interest. We are also investigating the possibility of targeting the characterization of shallow oil sands reservoirs. Regardless of the sites selected, the results will be relevant to both aquifer and reservoir characterization.

"The objective of this proposal is to identify bioactivity of components derived from marine phytoplankton that

enhance the growth of mammalian cells in culture. Canadian Pacific Algae Inc. produce extracts from marine

phytoplankton that are commercialized as natural health products, skin care products, beverages and functional

foods as bio-available complexes containing vitamins, minerals. There are potentially bioactive components

in these extracts that could be used for the growth support of mammalian cells in culture. These cultures

support the large-scale production of biopharmaceuticals. The challenge of the biotechnology industry over the

last ten years has been to identify safer components of non-animal origin that could substitute for serum in the

support of the growth of producer mammalian cell lines. This has led to a strong demand for cell culture

formulations that are serum-free/ animal component-free for large-scale manufacturing processes. However,

the performance of these formulations remains poor because of the presence of undefined components that can

affect the quality and consistency. We intend to determine whether the components of extracted phytoplankton

"The research funded by this proposal will help us to better understand convection in Earth's mantle as well as other geological phenomena that are fluid mechanical in nature by means of numerical modelling.  Thermal convection in the Earth's mantle is the process that controls the rate at which Earth is cooling and it supplies the driving force for plate tectonic motions.  These are the cause of many important surface geological processes.  Convection in Earth's mantle has also lead to the differentiation of the Earth into distinct layers of mantle and crust through volcanism at the Earth's surface.  The mantle sits atop the core and hence controls the rate at which the core is cooling which affects the rate at which the inner core is growing through freezing as well as the generation of the Earth's magnetic field.   I am very interested in understanding the detailed thermal energy budget of the earth's interior and the history of the above mentioned processes.  Modelling of convection in Earth's mantle is necessary in order to investigate how factors such as mantle phase transitions and differing distributions of viscosity and geochemistry can affect the efficiency of heat transport in the mantle and Earth's long-term evolution.  I also propose to initiate a program of modelling the thermal evolution of Mars and the other terrestrial planets in order to help understand the similarities and differences between these planets and our own.

I am also very interested in ""mushy layers"" in geological systems.  Mushy layers often occur when there is solidification or melting of a multi-component mixture.  They are believed to exist in solidifying magma chambers, in sea-ice and at the inner-core outer-core boundary.  Their dynamics are interesting because fractionation of the components occurs as solidification proceeds which can result in buoyancy forces that drive convection which in turn can affect the pattern of melting and solidification and the composition of the final system.  I propose to build and use numerical models of these geological systems in order to better understand their dynamics.

"My research is trying to discover how acyl carrier protein (ACP), a key central protein in bacterial fatty acid synthesis, can recognize and discriminate among its multiple protein partners. These partners include over three dozen enzymes involved in synthesis of membrane lipids, toxins (eg. endotoxin), and other essential components of bacterial growth and pathogenesis. ACP must fold to enclose attached fatty acids as it carries them through the watery environment of the cell, but must then unfold to release them upon interaction with ACP-dependent enzymes.  We believe that ACP is a special flexible and dynamic protein, with specific amino acids important for enzyme binding and triggering the unfolding and release of the acyl chain.



Our main approach is to engineer defined amino acid replacements in ACP using site-directed mutagenesis; this provides information either by blocking ACP function with selected enzymes, or by introducing probes (eg. fluorescence) to track the binding and structural events at the molecular level. We also use a method called proteomics, which can rapidly identify and characterize new ACP partners among the thousands of proteins in a bacterial cell.  As bacteria need fatty acids to survive and cause disease, our studies will provide insight into the design of antibiotics.  Our research will also help understand how ACP-like proteins function in the synthesis of many natural products.

"Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is a perpetual threat to wheat production. Sprouting in wheat can result in massive harvest losses of up to 40% in the price/tonne for producers because sprouted grain is an important downgrading factor. Seed dormancy, which is controlled by genetic and environmental factors, should be strong enough to inhibit germination. PHS resistance is a form of grade protection that is best built into wheat cultivars through genetic resistance. However, still very little is known about the processes and molecular signalling mechanisms occurring during dormancy control. The research program aims to examine sources of wheat seed dormancy and sprouting resistance. I propose the proteomic analysis of dormancy in all aspects - biomarker pattern linking genome to proteome, genetics factors control to specific phenotypic expression plasticity, post-translational signalling, phytohormone-mediated response and effect of environmental changes. In the next five years, in-depth systematic analysis of differential protein correlation profiling including localization, dynamics, and interaction partners will be focused on specific and functionally relevant 'sub-proteomes'. The hybrid lines of doubled haploid populations segregating for dormancy/sprouting resistance will be used to validate the identified candidate biomarker proteins. The research will create new knowledge regarding the biochemical nature of sprouting resistance and dormancy control, will lead to understanding of the biochemical nature for reduced wheat seed dormancy under unfavourable environmental conditions and identify molecular basis and genetic resources for sustained, internationally competitive, variety development. The outcome of this research is the thorough evaluation of germplasm enhanced for sprouting resistance by the systematic proteomic analysis of dormancy biomarkers. The broad basis of the germplasm, derived from elite Canadian genetics, ensures genetic diversity for long term selection as well as for immediate variety development.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Plant Biology & Food Science",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Newfoundland and Labrador",Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador

"Several water masses with very distinctive characteristics make up the fresh-water section of the St. Lawrence River (SLR).  In particular, carbonate-rich 'green' waters from the Great Lakes and the  'brown' waters from the Ottawa River draining the Canadian Shield stand out.  These waters do not mix subtantially until they pass Lake Saint-Pierre, near Trois-Rivi�res. Green and brown waters differ in productivity, transparence, and contaminant loads.  Using the research vessel Lampsilis,  a unique platform to sample shallow areas of the SLR, we will collect invertebrates and six species of fish.  State-of-the-art techniques such as stable isotope analysis and molecular genetics will allow us to identify fish species and age classes of fish  that live in either one of the water masses or continually travel between  them.  We will test the hypothesis that affiliation to a water masse inferred from isotopic analyses can be used to predict concentration of mercury in fish of the SLR, a ubiquitous contaminant in this ecosystem.  If confirmed, this result would then enable us to model contaminant fluxes from various water masses in the SLR from hydrological data, thus predicting a complex ecological variable (contaminant concentration) from a simple one (hydrology). Likewise, we will investigate if fish living in different water masses show different patterns in growth rate.

"It is in mammals that motor systems achieve the highest degree of complexity in terms of behaviors (movements) and neural substrates that control them. Motor systems develop mostly prenatally and are not easily accessible for experimentation. This program aims at gaining the most comprehensive understanding of mammalian motor development. We use as an experimental model the opossum Monodelphis domestica, a marsupial born 13-14 days post-conception with very immature forelimbs performing low amplitude, rhythmic and alternate flexion/extension movements, and immobile hindlimbs buds. The pup is attached to a mother's nipple for three weeks and cannot support weight or locomote if detached. We wish to determine the timing of formation of limb innervation and of the nerve pathways impinging on the spinal cord enlargements: their axogenesis, their synaptogenesis in the limbs or the spinal cord, the expression of neurotransmitters and receptors, their myelinogenesis and  their functional activity. We wish to understand how these different systems interact and interplay during development to produce the mature motor behaviors. To do so, we employ axonal tracing to monitor axogenesis as well as to identify the location of spinal motoneurons or interneurons trans-synaptically; genetic markers as a second label of motoneuronal pools and interneurons; immunohistochemistry to reveal connexin (a gap junction protein), synaptic proteins, neurotransmitters or their transporters or their receptors, and myelin proteins; electrophysiology and pharmacology (such as neurotransmitter/receptor agonists and antagonists) to determine the functional aspect of the systems studied. Experiments are done in vivo and in vitro and the anatomical preparations are observed mainly in light microscopy. The findings are to be correlated with those on behavioral development (sensorimotor reflexes, locomotion).

cover with additional layers of materials which would otTer a favourable substrate for the development

methanotrophic bacteria. These bacteria can passively oxidize C02 into CH4, without the need for particular

equipment or maintenance. The modified final cover would thus become a large-scale biofilter, referred to as a

passive methane oxidation barrier (PMOB). We are convinced that a well conceived PMOB can reduce fugitiVE

CH4 emissions with a high rate of efficiency during the post-closure phase of a site, particularly between the

moment that biogas extraction systems are shut off and the end of CH4 production, which can last for decades.

Our expertise in related projects, in which we monitored PMOBs built according to another concept, is a

considerable asset for the success of the proposed study. Our team lmows today that it is possible to reach very

high levels of oxidation efficiency (sometimes in the vicinity of 100%). This research project represents a

decisive stage of the development of the teclmology ofPMOBs. The objective is to build 2 PMOBs at an

existing landfill, and monitor their behaviour and effectiveness in reducing fugitive emissions. This project is

strategic because it will enable our multidisciplinary team to develop the concept (and the state ofknowledge)

ofPMOBs to a point that our current industrial paliner will feel encouraged, at the end of the 3 years of the

project, to invest in a pre-cOlmnercial stage PMOB. Moreover, the imlovative concept can be applied in any

lawful environment, which convinces us that this concept (or variations thereot) will one day be implemented

in most landfills. Researchers from around the globe working with landfill covers are gaining interest in this

topic, and our project will be followed closely.

"In a few months one of the most important and most ambitious experiments of humankind up to now will start operations at CERN. This is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The whole high energy scientific community is expecting many new insights into Nature's secrets to come out in the data to be accumulated from the LHC detectors.



One of the major challenges for theorists is to be prepared for extracting information out of the data. Most of the new physics will be hidden as deviations of Standard Model of particle physics predictions. Computing such predictions with enough precision is thus crucial for the success of the LHC. The main challenges are the contributions from the strong force which is described by a theory known as Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD).



One of the main components of my research program is the use of techniques from string theory, Penrose's twistor theory and complex analysis to unveil new structures in QCD (and related theories) which deepen our understanding of the theory and at the same time provide new methods for extracting predictions. Already, some of the new techniques we have developed have reduced previously thought impossible calculations to simple exercises.



Looking at the present and the past in order to infer about the future one realizes that most current technology, e.g. computers, cell phones and nuclear power plants, has been made possible thanks to our understanding of Nature at the atomic and subatomic level. Next steps in technological breakthroughs should certainly come from successfully handling the next level, i.e., the World of elementary particles.

"In field crickets, Gryllus texensis, calling males attract females from a distance. But calling males also attract parasitic flies, Ormia ochracea, that deposit living maggots on calling males.  Fly larvae devour the cricket in about 7 days.  Calling more loudly or more often by male crickets attracts more female cricket, but more parasitic flies are also attracted.  The mating behaviour of G. texensis has been strongly influenced by flies.  For example, male crickets often remain silent near calling males where they intercept females attracted by the calling of other males, so-called satellite behaviour.  Many previously silent males start calling just before dawn, a time when flies are less active.   Male G. texensis are also much younger than female crickets.  We are studying the rates of fly attraction to different types of cricket songs, the levels of parasitism in areas where different species of crickets are hosts, and the reproduction and lifespan of male crickets under different conditions of fly density. Many laboratories are now extending our studies including the neurobiology of fly hearing, complete loss of song in some crickets  and the use of flies to control imported cricket pests.



We also study acoustical communication in Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches, Gromphadorhina portentosa.  In this species males produce loud hisses when disturbed and when fighting and courting.  The intensity of male hisses is strongly correlated with body size and we are studying ways in which females evaluate males as mates based on their hisses.



This program involves postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students and collaborators at overseas universities thus contributing to the education of highly qualified personnel.

"Sequential Population Analysis (SPA) is a common model used to estimate the size of fish stocks in Canada and many other countries. SPA is a version of cohort analysis in which commercial catches, other sources of mortality, and the results from fisheries surveys are used. These are longitudinal data measured with error.  In addition, the assumptions used in SPA are often tenuous. The objective of this research is to improve the data inputs and the modelling method. A common theme involves the use of random effects models. We will use generalized linear mixed models (GLMM's) with cluster and length-autocorrelated random effects to estimate the relative fishing efficiency of one survey vessel compared to another. Survey catches are used when estimating an SPA, and if there is a change in survey vessels or sampling protocols (e.g. net) then this has to be accounted for in the SPA. We will examine the role length-based processes have in an age-structured model like SPA, and make adjustments for such processes. We will also improve estimates of stock maturities using GLMM's in which some random regression parameters are autocorrelated. Maturities are combined with SPA results to estimate spawning stock biomass (SSB) - an important stock quantity. The problem is that maturity data are updated annually for unfinished (e.g. recent) cohorts and this can result in substantial changes in estimates, and substantial retrospective differences in SSB estimates. Tagging data can also be used to refine and improve SPA estimates. A difficult problem when analyzing tag-returns from length-selective fisheries is accounting for fish growth between the time of release and capture. Recently, random-effects models have been used for this purpose, and we wish to adapt these approaches for an extensive data set involving cod tagged off the coast of Newfoundland since 1997. The final area involves developing diagnostics to detect when SPA may be in serious error. Highly parameterized SPA's can mask serious violations in model assumptions, and this can create large biases in stock estimates. We will investigate methods that indicate when an SPA is seriously mis-specified, and what the source of the mis-specification is.","P�che commerciale","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","Statistical Sciences",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Newfoundland and Labrador",Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador
"    )	The extent to which today's technologically driven society relies on magnetic materials was unimaginable even as recently as 20 years ago. Their usefulness and applications range from the trivial but useful refrigerator magnets to the ubiquitous computer, recording media, mobile telephones and superconducting magnets with life-saving potential in scanning and imaging devices.

    )	It is clear that the Rare-Earth elements are crucial to the development of magnetic technologies. Their significance can be readily appreciated by the simple consideration that Rare-Earth compounds are the basis for (i) the World's most powerful permanent-magnets, (ii) high-temperature superconductors, (iii) the next generation of the World's refrigerator materials, and (iv) magnetic random access memory (MRAM) data storage (based on magnetic Rare-Earth perovskites), to name but four important technological applications.

    )	The remarkable evolution of magnetic materials in the 20th century is a direct result of the systematic search for new materials coupled with a desire to understand their properties, along with the need to optimize the magnetic performance of materials. The Rare-Earth elements are very similar, chemically, but they provide a remarkably rich variety of intrinsic magnetic behaviour. Rare-Earth magnetic materials are important from both fundamental and applied viewpoints and the research to be pursued here involves the study of the intrinsic magnetic behaviour and crystallography of Rare-Earth intermetallic compounds. We will employ pulsed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to measure the magnetic and electric splittings of nuclear energy levels and to relate these to the atomic magnetism of the material under investigation. As such, we probe a compound's magnetism using both nuclear and atomic information.

"Intermediate filaments (IFs) are with microtubules and actin microfilaments the major cytoskeletal components of most mammalian cells. Modifications in K8/18 IFs organisation and formation of keratin containing aggregates called Mallory bodies (MBs) are common to many human chronic liver diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, Wilson's disease, Indian childhood cirrhosis and liver steatosis in obesity. Recent studies realised by us and others have shown evidences that K8/18 play an important role in the protection of hepatocytes against chronic stress-induced liver injuries. 

The long-term objective of our project is to determine the molecular mechanism by which K8/18 accomplish their protective role in hepatocytes. More specifically we want to 1) study the role of keratin phosphorylation on specific sites (K8 S73, K8S431 and K18 S52) in the apoptotic signalling pathway in hepatocytes. In this regard we will test the hypothesis that keratins act as a key regulator in maintaining the delicate balance between pro and anti-apoptotic signals molecules by directly interacting with pro (FASr) and anti (pAKT) apoptotic molecules. 2) There is accumulating evidence that sites and pattern- specific phosphorylation of keratin play a key role in the protection of hepatocytes against stress. Thus, we want to characterize K8/18 phosphorylation paterns in control and GF treated hepatocytes and perform functional analysis of K8/18 phosphorylation. 

The characterization of the modifications that affect keratins (post-translational modification, association with other proteins) during the response of hepatocytes to stress and the study of their relation with hepatocytes functions will constitutes an important step in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms used by keratins to accomplish their functions. This will directly lead us to further research on the cross-talk between keratins and cell signalling, and on how keratins affect disease pathogenesis.

"Plant roots grow generally invisible to observation.  Their hidden nature, however, does not equate to a lack of ecological importance.  In many systems, such as grasslands, the majority of the living biomass is plant roots, rather than shoots.  Changes in root growth dynamics will have important implications for carbon and nitrogen cycling.  Even more broadly, the processes by which plant seek out and acquire resources are surprisingly poorly understood, in large part due to the difficulty of experimental observation.  As a result, it is unclear how plants will interact with the roots of neighbours, and whether plants segregrate soils or maintain high levels of root overlap.  This issue has important consquences for productivity, plant competitive interactions, and the maintenance of biodiversity.  To address both of these research areas, I am requesting funds for the purchase of a mini-rhizotron camera system, commonly called a 'root periscope'.  The camera allows repeated, non-destructive observations of roots in the soil.  These data are then used to estimate root turnover and patterns of root growth.  My lab currently has one such camera, though it is now 9 years old and ending the end of its functional life.  Improvements in optics have resulted in greatly improved image quality, leading to enhanced precision of data.  Failure to acquire a new camera prior to the final failure of the existing camera will have dramatically negative impacts on two major areas of my research program.",Environnement,Environnement,"Evolution and Ecology",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)",Alberta,Alberta

"Funds are requested to support a research program in experimental plant ecology.  The dominant theme of my research program is the examination of mechanisms that determine the function and diversity of complex ecological systems, with an emphasis on belowground processes.  Within this framework, I have three central research areas (i) plant competition and coexistence, (ii) plant behavioural ecology, and (iii) multi-trophic interactions.  My experimental approach to testing ecological theory, along with my ability to incorporate advances in evolutionary, behavioural, and statistical sciences into my research makes me well positioned to disentangle the complexity of natural communities.  



These research areas continue the long-term objectives I initiated in prior Discovery grants, and should lead to significant breakthroughs.  Recent advances in my lab in using molecular methods to identify plant roots to species from field samples will allow us to make great progress in understanding aspects of plant competition and community ecology.



With prior Discovery grant funding, I have been able to train over 40 HQP in the last five years, and the funds requested will allow for even more opportunities for the training of HQP.  I will continue to include high school, undergraduates, and graduate students in my lab, offering them a diverse environment for learning.  The students will learn methods in both molecular and field ecology, including the use advanced statistical models.  My lab has a culture of collaboration, ensuring students learn and contribute to a diversity of research topics.

"The motion of atoms in liquid metals and alloys, known as liquid diffusion, is an important transport process that occurs in castings, welds, and all processes that involve melting and solidification. Liquid diffusion determines, in part, the distribution of alloying elements, the microstructure and macrostructure of any component that was solidified from a molten condition which in turn contribute to the strength and toughness of  castings and welded components. Despite the importance of  liquid diffusion, little is known concerning the atomic motions that comprise the diffusion process because of the paucity of accurate, reliable data. Until recently, convective currents have masking the atomic motion due to diffusion alone. A very few accurate results free from convective transport have been obtained from experiments performed in microgravity but the expense of and accessibility to the microgravity environment limits the amount of information that can be obtained. It has recently been shown that accurate liquid diffusion results can be obtained in unit gravity  under certain conditions and it is proposed that these conditions be utilized to obtain data for a wide range of variables thus providing a data base from which a theory for liquid diffusion may be developed. 

As is the case for liquid diffusion, the atomic processes involved in melting and solidification are not well understood. With the advent of laser and electron beam welding, heating rates of one million degrees per second may be achieved but the effect of such high heating rates on the microstructure during heating and on the melting temperature itself have not been investigated. A study to determine, quantitatively,  the effect of heating rate on solid state transformation temperatures and melting temperatures is proposed with the objective of better understanding the effects of rapid heating and cooling on the properties of weldments. Such information will be valuable in designing procedures and processes for laser and electron beam welding.

"Future wireless communication networks are expected to effectively support large coverage area, heterogeneous multimedia applications, seamless roaming, and quick adaptation to network dynamics resulting from user mobility. As one of candidates for the next generation wireless communication networks, wireless mesh networks are considered to be promising due to their abilities in providing scalability, flexibility, resource efficiency, and quality of service (QoS) provisioning (in terms of network capacity, transmission latency, call dropping/blocking probability, etc.). The significance of wireless mesh networks has been supported by the current standard activities, such as IEEE 802.11s and IEEE 802.16. However, the practical applications of wireless mesh networks are strongly limited due to hostile wireless channel conditions, heterogeneous QoS requirements, non-infrastructure network topology, and multihop transmitting. Therefore, designing practically feasible wireless mesh networks has become a critical and emergent topic in the current telecommunications research field. In order to enhance the research in this field, the proposal focuses on designing effective and efficient network technologies for facilitating practical implementation of wireless mesh networks. Specifically, the proposal will focus on a) the distributed user relaying algorithms for network capacity improvement, b) the routing algorithms for high resource utilization and end-to-end QoS provisioning, and c) the analysis on network performance and the evaluation on the proposed algorithms. The integration of cross-layer design, heterogeneous traffic characteristics, and distributed and scalable requirements will be the major design principle. The research results will be disseminated through publications in journals and conference proceedings, technical seminars, and invention disclosures and patents. 

    The research is important and has close connection with commercial exploitation. It is expected that the research outcomes will have significant contributions to the cutting edge research and the state-of-the-art technology in the next generation wireless communication networks.

"This research is aimed at understanding how the brain operates to allow rodents, and by extension humans, to learn and remember information. The research uses rodents learning to navigate in a simple laboratory task in a way that is similar to the way rodents learn to navigate in their environment to find and remember places containing food and water, mates, nesting sites, and other things important for survival. Some of the research involves making very small amounts of damage in very specific brain areas, or delivering very small amounts of electric current precisely to restricted brain sites, or the recording of brain electrical activity. The behavioral performance of the animals and the exact form and strength of the recorded brain activity will be used to infer how information is stored and retrieved. The expected benefits are a better understanding of how the brain stores and retrieves information, and better information for the development of treatments for brain disorders involving memory loss.

"The overall objective of the proposed research program is to advance the fundamental study and engineering design of distributed, hierarchical and hybrid (DHH) control systems. Distributed and hierarchical system structures are universally employed to contend with system complexity, consider for instance the decentralized and hierarchical control systems of steel manufacturing plants, and those of the Internet and the air-traffic control and network wireless systems. Furthermore, hybrid systems, that is to say systems with both continuous and discrete states and dynamics, are inherent in the technologies employed in contemporary engineering systems, consider, for example, the chemical engineering and manufacturing process industries. Space vehicle trajectory control and space mission management systems vividly display distributed, hierarchical and hybrid control systems features. 

  The  proposed research grows directly from the proposer's current Discovery Grant in which crucial advances were made in terms of (i) the discovery of the Nash Certainty Equivalence (Mean Field) (NCE (MF)) theory of competitive large population (mass agent) stochastic systems, and (ii) the development of hybrid system optimization theories which have yielded the highly efficient Optimality Zone Maximum Principle algorithms for system trajectory optimization.

 In the proposed research program, this work will be extended to yield NCE (MF) theories and methodologies for mass systems in physical motion, including studies of systems where the individual agents can learn, adapt and form coalitions. Research on hybrid systems will involve geometric studies of the optimization of system switching surfaces, and a new interdisciplinary program will be initiated on hybrid thermodynamic systems control with applications in chemical and transportation engineering.

"Sintered powder metallurgy (PM) alloys are an attractive material for the aerospace and automotive industries as high strength/low weight substitutes for traditional products. For the aerospace industry pressure has been placed on the metallurgical community to develop new routes for processing Ni and Co-based Superalloys for gas turbine use due to the necessity to improve performance and reduce noxious emissions. Attempts to develop new materials using the attractive mechanical properties of intermetallics have been only marginally successful due to their inherent brittle nature. However PM is used to produce turbine disks and the fine grain nature along with near net shape capability of PM should be attractive for afterburner and combustor liners. PM formed Superalloys can also possess a more uniform microstructure thereby improving low cycle thermo-mechanical fatigue. Unfortunately, only a limited number of prealloyed/master alloy Superalloy powders are available and at times these have been found to suffer from heterogeneity in powder grain composition.  As well, poor compressibility and associated residual porosity on sintering have plagued the development of new Ni PM alloys and applications. Thus the two objectives of this proposal are to continue research on development of a Ni-Cr-Fe based PM Superalloy similar to IN600 with minimal residual porosity and improved compressibility and to improve the oxidation resistance of the optimised Ni PM alloy by rare earth additions and/or additions of Y. 

The novelty is the development of a laboratory scale Ni-PM based process to correctly simulate industrial practice and using this to produce new reliable Ni-based PM products. Techniques include press/sinter, microstructural characterization SEM, TEM, EDS, DSC.

The significance is in the development of Ni-based PM components for the aerospace sector thereby providing an economical near-net-shape process for producing parts with enhanced elevated temperature and oxidation resistance.

"An increasing percentage of the population is spending longer and longer periods of time in seated postures. There is clear evidence that longer exposures to seated postures are linked with higher rates of reported low back pain. This association between low back pain and prolonged seated office and industrial work has driven preventative strategies that involve alternating standing and sitting postures. The strategy of alternating sit and stand while working has been shown to reduce perceived low back pain and have minimal impact on work efficiency. To accommodate this change in postures a variable height work surface is required, referred to as sit to stand workstations. Current technology prevents these workstations from meeting ergonomic standards of user height accommodation, leg clearance and reach envelopes. The goal of this research partnership is to incorporate current research on the prevention of injuries during prolonged standing and seated work and

develop a novel counter balance system that allows an unobstructed worker envelope to meet the existing height and reach ergonomic standards. One of the main design criteria is that the system incorporates a green solution based on a non- electricity powered counter balance system that will allow for minimal effort raising and lowering of the work surface by an individual worker. Low back injuries are the most common and frequently reported occupational injury in Canada with the highest average dollar cost of all compensatable injuries. Developing a product that meets the ergonomic standards, is a green solution, and could reduce the compensation claims associated with workplace injuries has a large societal value to Canada.","G�nie","Avancement des connaissances","Ontario Internal Decision Committee",1,"EGP   ","Engage Grants Program                                                                               ",Ontario,Ontario

This project develops novel dispersion-engineered multiscale micro and nano metamaterials (MTMs) for wireless systems and networks. Dispersion engineering is the design of broadband transmission line (TL) MTMs with arbitrary, controllable and possibly tunable frequency-dependent constitutive parameters (permittivity and permeability, or refractive index) or, equivalently in terms of high-frequency electronics, propagation constant and characteristic impedance. Multiscale MTMs are defined here as MTMs which owe their macroscopic properties to different structural scales: the molecular scale (spin magnetic dipole moments), the nano scale (ferromagnetic nanoparticles or nanowires) and the micro scale (subwavelength metallo-dielectric patterns). A multiscale MTM may include two or three of these structural scales.

Dispersion engineering will soon represent a ubiquitous new paradigm in modern electronics and photonics. The development of multiscale MTMs will provide unprecedented material properties leading to revolutionary devices. In particular, the multiscale ferromagnetic nanowires (FMNWs) which will be developed in this project are anticipated to exhibit unique performance and functionality, including magnet-less (shape) bias, low-loss, magnetizations superior to 8 kG, operation frequencies beyond 30-40 GHz, super-high power handling and stability temperature, compact size magnetostatic wave (MSW) configurations, ultra-wide tunability range, excellent MTM homogeneity and super-flexible dispersion.

Among the applications developed, there will be: multiscale nonreciprocal FMNW isolators, circulators and phase shifters, analog pulse shapers and signal processors, beam-scanning and forming antennas, quasi-optical negative refractive-index (NRI) imaging systems based on multiscale clustered FMNW MTMs.

"This project will develop a groundbreaking Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) smart antenna system based on the new Composite Right/Left-Handed (CRLH) metamaterial leaky-wave antenna (LWA) technology for enhanced wireless communication performances. The proposed system will incorporate a DSP interface controlling the LWAs to dynamically scan the entire 3D space in order lock in real-time onto the optimal channel of the scattering (and possibly mobile) environment. This operation will be enabled by the unique features of smart CRLH LWAs, which provide pencil-beam electronic scanning, using varactors, while requiring only a small footprint and necessitating no feeding network, in contrast to conventional array approaches. This system will offer radical improvements in the key performance attributes of emergent MIMO technology, including reduced power consumption, improved compactness, and enhanced radiation pattern diversity leading to higher data throughput and higher channel reliability for the end-user.

"The accretion of oceanic arcs to continental margins has been a key contributor to continental growth since the Late Archean, and the remnants of island arcs, which are often the focus of mineral exploration activity, have been identified in several Canadian regions. However, the mechanisms by which arcs are accreted and the continental crust becomes stabilised are poorly understood. If island arcs contain significant volumes of continental-style crust, then continental growth through direct arc accretion may be feasible if the more mafic lower arc crust can be removed by some form of presently unknown delamination process. Alternatively, mafic arc crust requires syn- or post-accretion modification to produce the intermediate composition continental crust that exists today. An integrated multichannel seismic reflection and 3-D refraction survey, the only true 3-D survey yet acquired over an island arc, extends more than 300 km along the archetypical Mariana island arc, and is the focus of this proposal. One objective is to determine quantitatively the 3-D distribution of felsic-intermediate composition crust within the Mariana arc, and its relation to the underlying mafic lower crust. Variations of 5-10 percent in the volume of intermediate composition arc crust significantly alter petrologic predictions of the volumes of associated mafic restite and cumulates that require subsequent removal before or during arc-continent collision. A second objective is the identification using the high-quality multichannel seismic data of reflectors beneath the arc associated with arc magmatism, delamination of the lower arc crust, and the arc's structural evolution, e.g. arc rifting, extension, and subsidence. Waveform tomography will also be used to map the variability in composition of both volcanic rocks and intrusions in the shallower sections of the arc, and to determine their along-strike variability on a broader scale than is possible by geological sampling. At the largest scale, this project will constrain the process by which the proposed foundering of deep arc crust occurs every few million years.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Solid Earth Sciences",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Earth's surface can be subdivided into several tectonic plates on which the continents sit.  Because these plates are in constant motion, continents often collide, forming mountain belts.  All of the Earth's great mountain belts such as the Alps, and the Himalayas are formed due to plate collisions.  Along these collisional fronts, the Earth's crust is continually consumed as it is buried to great depth, in a process known as subduction, and then recycled when some of this buried crust is brought back to the surface (exhumation).  Mountain building and crustal recycling is believed to be driven by the transformation of subducted and tectonically buried crustal rocks to denser material (eclogite).  At depths greater than 40 km, the crust is thought to behave plastically because, the high pressure and temperature conditions in the down-going slab are thought to inhibit brittle deformation, which may cause earthquakes.  However, many earthquakes occur at depths of 50-300 km.  Understanding and predicting the occurrence of earthquakes requires resolving the physical-chemical processes involved in fault movement and the factors controlling stick-slip events in subduction zones.  Research into these areas is important because earthquakes are commonly localized around the coastal areas of continents, which are highly populated, such as California and British Colombia, and when located under the ocean, can create tsunamis.","Sciences de la terre","Avancement des connaissances","Solid Earth Sciences",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Manitoba,Manitoba

"The effectiveness of CFD in an industrial setting rests on many factors ranging from reliable physical models, accurate and robust numerical algorithms to sophisticated computer implementations to facilitate information management. In this proposal, we address some of these issues in the context of complex flow based problems whose difficulties are the coupling of several phenomena such as turbulence, chemical reactions,

radiative heat transfer, moving or ablating boundaries.



The motivation for these topics originates from a number of industrial applications whose difficulties arise from the need to resolve a wide range of length and time scales, compounded with the geometric complexities inherent in practical applications.



- modelling of the plasma flows produced in laser machining and in high current circuit breaker analysis, involving high speed gas flow with complex energy transfer phenomena, and in particular the integration of an accurate and efficient radiation model;

- developement of a hybrid grid capability to capture the large gradients of flow properties in the vicinity of solid walls in complex configurations such as fuselage-wing jonctions, internal turbomachinery  components and arteries in bio-fluid applications.

- investigation of the fabrication of high performance fibers for composite materials, by numerical and physical modelling of the  LCVD   (laser chemical vapor deposition) to characterise this process in view of   prototyping reactor design.

"The proposed research is into tools and technology for high-performance text processing using parallel bit stream technology on commodity multicore processors. Current research results have established that parallel bit stream technology can provide order of magnitude performance improvements over traditional byte-at-a-time character processing on modern pipelined processors in applications such as string search, character set transcoding, lexical analysis, regular expression matching and XML parsing. In effect, the parallel bit stream technology makes substantial use of intraregister parallelism in order to process up to 128 characters at a time using 128 bit registers. However, this involves new forms of programming for which high-level tool support (e.g., high-level programming languages) are not yet available. Furthermore, current trends in commodity processor design involving multicore processors are creating demands to find new forms of parallel programming to take advantage of intrachip parallelism. By developing new techniques to leverage intraregister parallelism in support of intrachip parallelism, further performance advantages of these parallel text processing techniques over sequential byte-at-a-time techniques can be expected. By developing high-level programming tools that map to implementations based on parallel bit stream technology, these performance benefits can be made broadly available to programmers without the need for tricky and error-prone low-level programming.","Technologie de l'information, des ordinateurs et des r�seaux de communications","Avancement des connaissances","Computing and Information Sciences - A",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"Elucidation of induced resistance in Arabidopsis



Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) is a resistance response that plants mount against microbial infections. SAR is induced by an ""immunizing"" infection in one part of the plant which produces a signal which moves to the uninfected parts of the plant to induce resistance throughout the plant to pathogens that normally cause disease. The outcome of the SAR response is similar to vaccination in mammals except that it protects the plant against many different unrelated pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, nematodes). We have isolated a SAR-defective mutant, dir1-1 (defective in induced resistance) and cloned the mutant and wild type genes. Our studies indicate that DIR1 is involved in production of the signal that moves in the plant. The study of this unique SAR signaling gene and its protein product will contribute to understanding how SAR is induced and manifested in plants. We are also studying another robust resistance response, called Age-Related Resistance (ARR), in which older plants become more resistant to some pathogens. We have identified a number genes required for ARR and our proposed studies will elucidate how these genes regulate and contribute to ARR. Although plants naturally defend themselves from disease, these defenses are not always effective as demonstrated by crop losses caused by disease every year (20-40% world-wide). By understanding how plants defend themselves from disease, we can use this information to create genetically modified (GM) crops that are more resistant to many different diseases, thus reducing our reliance on chemical pesticides. In addition, this research will lead to the creation of GM crops without introducing non-plant genes, eliminating the problem of genetic pollution and the ethical issue of moving genes across species barriers.

"When a fine beam of X-rays is directed at a crystal, the X-rays are reflected only at specific angles. The intensity of the reflected beam at each of these angles vary and the intensity depends on the arrangement of the atoms in the crystal. It is possible to work out the arrangement of all the atoms within a crystal from a consideration of all the intensities of the reflected X-rays. The X-rays are actually reflected by the electrons around each of the atoms. Most of the electrons are held in a tight cloud close to the centre of the atom (the core electrons), but a few electrons, further away from the atom centre interact with the electron clouds of adjacent atoms. This interaction creates the attraction which holds the atoms together in a molecule.

  The closely-held electrons are those which reflect most efficiently. It is much more difficult to ""see"" the other electrons which form the bonds between atoms. However, if the crystal is cooled to below -100oC and the X-ray reflection intensities are measured with real care, it is possible to extract some information about the bonding electrons. It has been found that the bonding electrons have little effect on the intensity of the X-rays reflected at high angles. This allows the calculation of the effect the core electrons would have alone. An examination of the very small difference between the electron clouds, calculated from the core electrons alone, and that actually observed then brings out the details of the bonding electrons.

    )	We are using this technique to examine the bonding electrons in molecules and have recently developed the technique so that we can now ""see"" the even weaker interactions that occur between molecules in a solid. These weak interactions are of crucial importance for the way solid materials behave and are also vital for the proper functioning of large biological molecules (eg enzymes). We are planning to examine some simple crystalline solids which - systems for the larger molecules and to produce a complete map and full explanation of all the weak interactions in these model solids.

"Many people have heard the popular catchphrase ""We are made of stardust"". Indeed, in a truly cosmic lifecycle, stars, planets and their inhabitants are born from the ashes of stars that have long gone, but whose existence is evidenced by our very own chemical composition. Indeed, we now know that all elements like carbon and oxygen are produced in the interior of stars. Exactly how this stardust is formed however, and what its exact chemical composition is, is not well known. 



I propose here to study those stars that are now in the process of converting their chemical elements into stardust right before they die. However, to better understand the process of dust formation, we will also need to look at what happens right before the dust is formed. That is, we need to study the processes leading to the formation of molecules. Those small entities are easily identified, and can be used as powerful, distant measuring probes so that we can obtain all the information we need to understand the formation process of stardust.

"In this equipment grant I am requesting funds for the purchase of a thermal cycler to detect and manipulate genes for ion channels from sympathetic neurons. This equipment is required to assist in the site-directed mutagenesis, amplification, detection and deletion of genes for ion channel subunits. Current research in my laboratory focuses on understanding neuronal function, which is directly determined by the activity and function of ion channels. I will use the requested equipment to investigate how ion channels work and how they are modulated during stress conditions. Conditions such as those generated by oxidative stress can alter the structure of ion channel proteins, and therefore, affect their function. This equipment will assist our research on how serotoninergic type 3 receptor (5HT3R) function during physiological conditions and during oxidative stress. In the future, my research program will extend to other ion channels in diverse cellular models and expression systems, making the acquirement of this equipment highly important for my research program for many years to come. The equipment can (and will) also be used by colleagues both inside and outside of my department. Furthermore, this particular system has been improved with state-of-the-art components that make it extremely accurate and reliable for DNA work. This equipment will assist graduate students and trainees at the Department of Physiology and at the Neural Systems & Plasticity Research Group, being of great advantage to the training of highly qualified personnel.

"This research studies supersymmetric theories, which are theories that involve a symmetry relating bosons, the particles responsible for force fields in nature, to fermions, the particles which obey the Pauli exclusion principle, and which are responsible for stable matter. In nature supersymmetry cannot be exact as we do not observe pairs of bosons and fermions at the same mass. This research will study the mechanism by which supersymmetry is broken and ceases to be an exact symmetry. By looking at the effects of the supersymmetry breaking we hope to learn more about the high energy behaviour of supersymmetric theories, which affects how the supersymmetry is broken at low energies and thus, how these theories relate to nature.

"The paucity of research on the rehabilitation of upland and wetland habitats in subarctic and high boreal biomes impedes efforts to develop suitable rehabilitation protocols for severely disturbed environments. This is especially true for the Hudson Bay Lowland. This research proposal has four specific objectives to begin to fill this void at the De Beers' Victor Mine within the Hudson Bay Lowland:

1)    )	to test whether peatland rehabilitation techniques developed for mined peatlands in northern temperate and

southern boreal peatlands are suitable in a subarctic context and to modify them as required;

2)    )	to identify suitable plants for the rehabilitation of newly created upland areas through a functional inventory

of local native plants;

3)    )	to characterize existing upland areas as rehabilitation targets for newly created upland deposits; and

4)    )	to develop soil amendment protocols for newly created upland areas to make them adequately fertile and

erosion resistant to support local vegetation.

This research will benefit De Beers Canada by determining protocols for the successful rehabilitation of disturbed upland and peatland habitats associated with the mining activities at Victor Mine. This proposed research will not only be applicable to the Victor Mine, but will be an invaluable knowledge base to restore severely disturbed terrestrial environments in Canada's north, in particular those associated with other mining operations. It will advance the field of ecological rehabilitation globally. At Laurentian University, this research will enhance its well known experience and expertise in the rehabilitation of degraded environments and its efforts to build knowledge on responsible mining in Canada and worldwide.

"Differential equation models are often built on scientific principles such as conservation of mass, energy and momentum, giving them easily interpretable parameters.  Predator prey interactions, chemical reaction dynamics and epidemic outbreaks are typical examples of dynamics well described with differential equation models.  Depending on the values of parameters and other inputs, a single differential equation model can describe a wide variety of behaviours such as oscillations, steady states and exponential growth and decay, giving them the flexibility to describe a system under a variety of conditions.  However, the flexibility of this class of model comes at the price of difficult statistical challenges.   This proposed statistical research is aimed at making differential equation models more accessible and informative by extending inference beyond parameter estimation.  The proposed research develops the statistical technology to improve inference associated with differential equation models in areas of model selection, and inference about bifurcation points.  Furthermore, this research proposes to extend lessons learned from analysis of differential equation models into spatio-temporal models and smoothing methods.  



These projects have a wide range of potential applications including management of insect pests ravaging the forests and fruit orchards of BC, fisheries management and determining dangerous conditions to avoid in chemical reactors.

"Phytoplankton are tiny cells in oceans and lakes that use light to covert carbon dioxide to living material, through photosynthesis.  There are many different species of phytoplankton, each with particular characteristics and requirements for growth.  We study how different species of phytoplankton interact with the changing environment, and what determines their patterns and locations of growth.  We are seeking to understand why particular species are successful in particular regions, to help understand the global cycling of carbon between the atmosphere, the surface ocean where phytoplankton live, and the deep ocean, where some of the cells sink after they die.  For these studies we need to measure and monitor the capacity for photosynthesis.  One approach is to monitor the trace levels of fluorescent light the phytoplankton emit as a byproduct of their photosynthetic activity.  Variations in fluorescence can be analyzed to infer detailed information on the photosynthetic activity.  Fluorescence analyses are rapid, do not disturb the cells, and can be used to analyze even very low numbers of cells in natural communities.  The fluorescence signals can be detected from space, or from individual cells.  We are proposing to purchase an advanced, highly sensitive fluorometer from Satlantic, a technology company in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to study phytoplankton communities around the world, and in particular, phytoplankton in the Arctic ocean.",Environnement,Environnement,"Biological Systems and Functions",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","New Brunswick",Nouveau-Brunswick
"CO2 uptake and biological productivity in the oceans is driven by the photosynthesis of small phytoplankton cells, which are entrained in the water column. Phytoplankton, however,  suffer ongoing light inactivation of their photosynthetic system, and to maintain activity they must counter this inactivation with repair through removal and replacement of damaged proteins.  If the inactivation outruns repair the phytoplankton suffer inhibition of their photosynthesis which lowers their capacity to take up CO2 and therefore lowers marine productivity, ultimately with links back to atmospheric CO2.  My NSERC research program is founded upon the conviction that quantifying this dynamic balance in phytoplankton is important to understand marine productivity and the likely responses of marine communities to environmental change.

   We are finding that phytoplankton strains isolated from diverse habitats show comparable  susceptibility to the initial inactivation of photosynthesis, but have widely different capacities to repair and reverse the damage.   This means that different phytoplankton have different abilities to withstand and exploit variable light in the environment, which can vary rapidly for a cell as it moves up or down in the water.  The repair process is also sensitive to nutrients like nitrogen, UV and temperature, creating further interactions with the environment which we plan to investigate.

   A spin-off company, Environmental Proteomics, collaborates with my group and many others to create and distribute the detection systems necessary for this research.

"Physical systems take on many various configurations.  A simple example is given by the tip of a pendulum as it moves along the circle given by its radius. As another example, the space of all possible positions of a double pendulum is described by an inner tube (mathematicians call this a torus).  An important goal is to understand the motions of physical systems under forces such as gravity.  



Mathematicians describe these configurations as the zeros of a collection of polynomials,  In the example of the circle, the famous equation is x^2 + y^2 -1 = 0.  Mathematicians and physicists have developed sophisticated techniques for understanding physical systems through an analysis of the algebraic and geometric properties of the associated equations.  These fascinating and sophisticated techniques have developed over centuries of attention. 



In many instances the configurations exhibit symmetries, and these are best detected by symmetries of the associated polynomials.  This is the subject of invariant theory which has its roots in the time of Newton and Vandermonde.  These symmetries reflect periodic phenomena which can therefore be understood and described in a wide variety of settings.



Modern day applications have been made to such examples as the positioning of satellites through to the detection of appropriate use of stamps by the post-office.  In each instance the problem involves the comparison of an image which is rotated or translated, even upside-down, to an existing template picture using the techniques of invariant theory.

"The foundations of our work lie in physics, where we study processes involving the innermost electrons that orbit the atom. One such process is the ejection of these electrons by swift heavy projectiles such as protons from a particle accelerator, and another is the emission of characteristic X-rays during the subsequent relaxation of the excited atom. Our experiments are interpreted through highly refined computer analysis of the energy distributions of these X-rays. 

Out of this fundamental work has come the powerful analytical technique of PIXE (proton-induced X-ray emission) which uses the same accelerators, X-ray detectors, and computational methods. I have co-authored the two main books on PIXE, and my group has developed the most widely used software package (GUPIX) in the field, which we have now supplied to 130 labs in 30 countries.  We apply PIXE in a wide range of collaborative projects with Canadian, U.S. and European scientists, recently studying issues as diverse as particulate air pollution, Arctic and Atlantic fish migration, human bone health, and trace elements in coal. 

We are reconfiguring GUPIX to handle the data from the Alpha-Particle X-Ray Spectrometers (APXS) on the Mars Exploration Rovers, thus improving the accuracy of elemental analysis of rocks and soils on Mars. We have devised a new approach to part of the Martian data - the so-called ""scatter peaks"" - which recently resulted in our making the first quantitative in situ measurement of water within subsurface soils near the Martian equator. As a co-investigator on the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory mission, I will be applying these methods to the data from the MSL APXS.

"My research spans a wide range of subjects, from theoretical fluid dynamics to numerical analysis. My primary research focus is on nonlinear interactions of waves in geophysical fluid flows, i.e., in the atmosphere and oceans. Wave interactions give rise to large-scale phenomena, such as the quasi-biennial oscillation between easterly and westerly winds that is observed in the tropical stratosphere, and smaller-scale phenomena, such as downslope windstorms and turbulence over mountains. It is important that wave effects are represented accurately weather and climate models. My investigations aim to provide us with the needed understanding of  the effects of the waves, as well as the mechanisms for their generation and propagation. 



One of my ongoing topics of interest is the development of parameterization schemes that are used in climate models to represent the drag force that results from gravity waves in the middle atmosphere. My other current interests in the field of geophysical fluid dynamics include the evolution of mountain waves in the lower levels of the atmosphere, planetary wave interactions in the atmosphere and ocean, and gravity wave propagation in the ionosphere, the region in the upper atmosphere where ions and electrons are present in large enough quantities to affect wave propagation.



My secondary line of research involves numerical methods for solving partial differential equations. The methods that interest me are applicable to a variety of physical problems including, but not limited to, geophysical fluid dynamics. Recently I have studied high-order compact finite difference methods applied to problems which require numerical grids with non-uniform spacing, and alternating-direction explicit methods for modelling physical processes that include both fluid convection and heat diffusion. I am currently investigating the implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions for use in fluid simulations.","Climat et atmosph�re",Environnement,"Environmental Earth Sciences",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"Trees of the genus Populus are ideally suited for production of biomass on the Canadian landscape. The genus

includes poplars, cottonwoods, aspens, and their hybrids (herein collectively referred to as poplars), which are

frequently the dominant broad-leaved tree species, and in some regions the only tree species, in Canadian

forests. Poplars are used widely in Canada for production of pulp and engineered solid wood products.

Recently, the deployment of poplars as short rotation fibre crops has been of interest in the context of global

climate change, both as a means by which to rapidly sequester carbon and as a feedstock for bioenergy

production. The utility of poplars in these applications is directly related to rates of biomass accumulation in

plantations. Recent analyses suggest that modest improvements in this yield are required to ensure that poplar

plantations are a viable option for the production of biomass for carbon sequestration, and, more specifically,

for bioenergy production. This project aims to leverage the burgeoning genomics toolbox that is available for

poplars to develop tools to improve biomass accumulation. The project will establish a research pipeline that

links gene discovery via genomics with carbon fixation, and ultimately biomass accumulation. The project is

founded on recent data that show that poplar biomass accumulation is directly, and positively, correlated with

the function of stomata, the dynamic pores on plant leaves that allow the uptake of CO2 while limiting water

loss. The project will explore the link between these genes, carbon sequestration and biomass accumulation in

"The retina of the eye contains light sensitive cells, neurons and blood vessels. Recent adaptive optics technology to correct for the optical effects of eye tissue on light now enables light to be precisely focused onto these structures of the retina at the rear of the eye. As a result, very detailed images are possible, which will assist in the diagnosis and understanding of eye disease due to diabetes. This application has four objectives: 1) to develop an instrument with adaptive optical correction to allow the study of the structural damage due to diabetes at a cellular level in the eyes of children and adolescents; 2) to determine whether the earliest changes associated with diabetic eye disease occur in neural cells or in blood vessels; 3) to use the high-resolution instrument and optical methods to locally test the function of the normal and diabetic retina and visual system and 4) to assess the feasibility of precise delivery of light onto the retina for earlier and better treatment of diabetic eye disease.

The novel instrument developed here will give high quality images of the changes in cells in both the vessels and the neurons in the retina. Because of increased resolution and contrast, the new instrument will make previously invisible features visible, answering an important scientific question of whether changes in neurons occur before, at the same time as or after changes to vessels. From a new, precise analysis of the activity in retinal neurons and of visual function, early changes in vision in diabetes will also be assessed. Adaptive optics, in combination with the new instrument, focus light to a small spot. With shaping in time, light with short, intense pulses may, in the future, be precisely delivered to the retina for less invasive therapies.

This research will lead to earlier diagnosis, the understanding of the disease progression and better treatment of childhood diabetes. Earlier detection and earlier and better treatment of the effects of diabetes in the retina will prevent vision loss and its associated impact on quality of life. The new instrumentation and methods developed here may have broader applications to other eye diseases.

"The technology to be advanced is a patented Mueller matrix polarimetry for enhanced imaging (MMPEI) technique. The technique takes advantage of differences across objects being imaged in their interaction with polarized light. In particular, many tissues reflect light of differing polarizations to a differing degree. We use this property to produce images with higher resolution, better contrast and overall improvement in image quality. This technique is broadly applicable to optical imaging using scanning laser beams. MMPEI has been shown to improve the quality of images taken of tissues at the rear of human eyes and of microscopy images. 



The objectives of this project are to 1) demonstrate that the technology will improve images in small animals; 2) refine the implementation of the polarimetry technique to improve its utility 3) test the amount of improvement provided by the technology when used in combination with adaptive optics and 4) advance potential industry partnerships.



Small animal optical imaging is the target area for MMPEI because it is a growing market of importance to scientists in many fields, for instance those studying development, genetics and  neuroscience. There is a need for an instrument specifically designed to image small animal eyes and Canadian companies have worldwide markets in this area. Noninvasive imaging, enabled by MMPEI, can track changes in animals in vivo, enabling better understanding of biology and animal models of human disease, and tracking of treatments. 



The implementation of the method will be improved with the intent to develop an add on device with broad applicability to improve imaging in scanning laser instruments, including microscopes, instruments used for human diagnosis and those used to image small animals.

"Proteins are amazing molecular machines that are essential for Life as we know it. After a century of protein research, we now have a very good understanding of how proteins are able to carry out their vast array of functions. However, our understanding is not deep enough to allow us to rationally design new protein structures with functions not found in Nature. Thus, when we want to use proteins as benign 'tools' to benefit mankind, we are limited to what Nature has provided us. Fortunately, Nature has been generous and protein 'tools' are now taken for granted in many aspects of modern life, including household products (e.g. laundry detergent), medical diagnostics (e.g. blood glucose sensors to control diabetes), and biotechnology (e.g. PCR).

     It is in this last category that the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from jellyfish has found widespread utility. GFP has the unique (among proteins) ability to generate a visible wavelength fluorophore within its own 3-dimensional structure and thus can absorb blue light and reemit it as green light. In the past decade, this remarkable protein 'tool' has enabled many exciting advances in biological research because genetically inserting GFP into a living cell or tissue allows one to 'see' biological structures that would otherwise be undetectable.

     My specific research interest is in expanding the 'toolkit' of proteins that are useful in basic biological research. For example, it is useful to have a wide selection of 'colors' of fluorescent proteins so that multiple biological structures can be 'visualized' simultaneously. We would also like to add a dynamic new dimension to fluorescent proteins and engineer them to be biosensors that change their fluorescence in response to specific biological events. Many of the potential applications of such biosensors lie in the realm of fundamental cell biology research. However, these technological advances will also be applicable to the areas of medical diagnostics, drug discovery, and advanced approaches for imaging and treatment of cancer.

"This project is motivated by some specific biological and mechanical systems: the pupil light reflex, brain neural networks and metal cutting. Although physically unrelated, the behaviour of these systems is influenced by the same factors: the presence of nonlinearities and time delays.  The time delays represent the time it takes information to propagate from one part of the system to another. The nonlinearity represents the fact that in these systems a small change in the state can often result in a large change in behaviour.  An oscillator is any object that performs a repetitive motion. A familiar example is the pendulum of a clock.  This project considers several oscillators which fall into two themes, based on how they are modelled mathematically.

[I] Neural Oscillators with Time Delayed Connections. The brain is made up of cells called neurons which communicate with each other through electrical signals. It is well known that these signals are oscillatory and that the properties of the oscillations depend on the characteristics of the individual neurons, how the neurons are connected to each other and the presence of time delays in the connections.  We will aim to answer the questions: Why do neural cells in different brain structures have different characteristics?  Why are neural cells connected in some ways and not others?  How do time delays affect the answers to these questions?

[II] Switching Oscillators with Time Delayed Feedback.The oscillations considered here include the vibrations of a tool used in metal cutting and the dilation and constriction of the pupil of the eye.  A notable aspect of these systems is that their defining properties rapidly switch depending on the state of the system.  We will examine the role of time delayed feedback in creating, eliminating or reducing the size of oscillations in these systems.

The goal of this work is twofold: to obtain a deeper mathematical understanding of the models for the systems, and to interpret this knowledge in light of the applications.

"    )	Meteors have been admired for centuries for their sometimes spectacular visual displays in the sky. In spite of this, it is only in the last two centuries that we have understood what causes the streaks of light; meteors are the collision of the Earth's atmosphere with pieces of comets and asteroids. We want to know what the meteoroids which produce meteors are made of, so that we can learn about the comet or asteroid which produced them was like. We also need to know how many of them collide with the Earth each day, so that engineers know how much shielding to put on satellites and other spacecraft.

    )	Studying meteors is like having sample return missions to virtually all comets and some asteroids whose orbits come near the Earth, but without the high costs. In order to get all the information we need about the meteors, we need to understand what happens when they collide with the atmosphere, producing light. The reactions can't currently be simulated in labs: the atmospheric density is so low, and the speed of the meteoroids so high, that we can't reproduce the conditions. The best way to understand what's going on is to take video of meteors at a very high frame rate and high resolution, to see how they break up, and what the luminous plasma around the pieces looks like. We will use a pair of mirrors to track meteors in the sky and record their images with a telescope. The system will let us look at details of the meteor heads which have never been studied, and will allow us to build up a better model of meteors in the atmosphere which will tell us what meteoroids, and so comets and asteroids, are made of.

"The descriptional complexity of an object is usually the shortest description of that object. For example, a possible descriptional complexity using natural languages could be the minimum number of words or letters necessary to describe the object. In computer science we use programs to describe objects, and the minimum ""size"" of all these programs is the descriptional complexity of the given object. We use various descriptions to represent an object in the memory of a computer. Each description follows rules, and is part of a formal language. The language and its representation form a formal system.

My research includes the study of formal systems,  their descriptional complexity, and the decriptional complexity of all possible operations using such systems.  I am looking into defining new formal systems for a variety of classes of formal languages with computable descriptional complexity. A possible application of formal language theory is for languages describing different categories of messages. For example, let us consider the language of SPAM. In order to recognize SPAM, mail filters make use of a special form of regular expressions, called regex. All newer programming languages have regex libraries or built-in regex instructions. I gave a formal treatment for these types of languages and introduced alternative formal systems in order to have     uniform implementations. Since these expressions introduce a high degree of non-determinism in implementations, I will study how to improve the efficiency and size complexity for various implementations.  In particular, I will focus on the non-determinism of the implemented system and on other possible improvements, like using cover languages. Statistical tests and other experimental tools will be used. I am considering involving my students to implement the formal systems and algorithms. The results of this theoretical research may have applications in compilers, bio-computing, and cryptography.

"The development of realistic stochastic models for risky asset price processes and their implementation to the pricing of generally exotic derivatives is at the heart of modern day financial mathematics. A vast body of research is devoted to this important area which poses computational and theoretical challenges. Current models go well beyond the celebrated Black-Scholes model which does not support commonly observed features such as volatility clustering and fat tail distributions for asset price returns. The observed leverage effect and the market implied volatility smiles are also completely absent in this model and not well replicated in some mathematical extensions of the model. The resolution of these model discrepancies is a fundamental issue and this continues to fuel interest in financial modelling and option pricing with the use of more realistic models. The goal of my research is to make further progress in this and related critical areas of financial mathematics. This proposal focuses on further innovative developments of alternative stochastic processes in the single and multi-asset domain with several applications to derivatives pricing. An underlying component of my research involves the use of our newly developed families of analytically tractable models. Our research to date has shown that our models are rich in their ability to realistically describe option market volatility smiles and skews. My most current work also develops analytically exact spectral expansions for first passage time densities, barrier options and seasoned lookback options for these new models. We have also recently succeeded in developing efficient algorithms for pricing exotic options under subfamilies of our new volatility smile models. This proposal will continue to build on new developments and applications of such alternative stochastic models. The development of efficient numerical algorithms for describing such processes leads to various applications in finance as well as in many other areas of mathematical modelling that involve stochastic processes. The mathematical and computational results that will be generated by this research are expected to significantly impact the field of financial mathematics.

"The Drosophila disconnected (disco) gene encodes a C2H2 type zinc finger transcription factor required for the development of central and peripheral nervous system.  disco expression during development is dynamic, suggesting a role for this gene in a variety of developmental processes. During the previous funding period we have investigated a novel function for disco in the patterning of Proximal -Distal (P-D) axis during leg and antennal development. The P-D axis refers to the way insect  appendages (or limbs) are organized from the portion closest to the body (proximal) to the structures that make the ti[p of the appendage. In vertebrates as well as insects the Distal-less (Dll) gene represents the master regulator of this important developmental process.

Our results implicated disco in Dll-dependent leg and antenna development and in the proper expression of Dll.  Down regulation of disco gene function in Dll domain mimics Dll mutation phenotypically and molecularly. Moreover up regulation of disco in Dll cells in a Dll mutant background partially rescues the mutant phenotype.  Our results demonstrate that disco and Dll participate in an auto regulatory feedback loop where Dll is required and sufficient for disco promoter activity and disco in turn is required for proper Dll transcription. Thus I propose as a working hypothesis that disco carries out its function in P-D patterning as a cofactor of Dll. Most interestingly our results suggest that disco may be required in the antenna as an inhibitor of retinal cell fate by restricting the expression of dachshund (dac). 

In this grant application I outline several experiments aimed at continuing our investigations of the role of disco in appendage development and its relationship to Dll dependent P-D development. In addition, I propose to extend these studies to the relationship between Dll and disco function in cell fate allocation in the visual primordium and in the eye antennal imaginal disc.

"Synthesis of new bioactive compounds of pharmaceutical interest represents a continuing challenge for curing cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other nosocomial infections. Most of the compounds demonstrating useful biological properties against these diseases possess a heterocyclic skeleton such as panacene, juglomycin A, lycoramine, mesembrine, aflatoxin B or isohydroxypsorofebrin. Unfortunately, the natural amount of these products is low and would require damaging an ecosystem to heal some patients. Consequently, it is extremely important to discover new synthetic methods to get these structures quickly for a potential biomedical application. In this context, the research program presented in this proposal is dedicated to the development of novel methodologies in heterocyclic chemistry. In a first part, we propose to develop a metal free aromatic coupling reaction accordingly to the concept of ""green chemistry"", a formal cycloaddition reaction between aromatics compounds and alkenes/alkynes and an oxidative allylation reaction extended to aromatic compounds. The aim of these transformations is to get heterocyclic skeletons that could be rapidly used in the total synthesis of natural products. In a second part, we plan to achieve the synthesis of enumerated compounds, whose chemical structures could be quickly reproduced with our methodologies. Results afforded by this research program should contribute to the knowledge advancement by the discovery of different novel methodologies applied to the direct synthesis of highly bioactive products.

"This research program is directed at understanding the formation and evolution of mantle-derived magmas and lithosphere in settings where two tectonic plates collide (arcs or convergent margins). The research focuses on the partition of fluid and metals between mantle, crust and atmosphere during the egress of magmas from their mantle source regions to eruptions in arc volcanoes where they degas into the atmosphere. The research effort seeks to understand the distribution and geochemical behaviour of key metals (Fe, Cu, Re, As, Sb, In, Sn, W) during the ascent, emplacement and cooling of arc magma, and is underpinned by systematic high pressure-temperature experimentation on: (a) mantle melting as a  function of oxygen fugacity (fO2), and (b) fluid/melt/crystal partitioning in primitive arc-derived magmas. Some of the experimental data are compared with an ongoing field study of mid-upper crustal igneous rocks in Jurassic-aged arc crust exposed in oblique section on Vancouver Island, B.C. 



Outcomes of the experimental work will address a number of broader questions on the fluxes of water and metals in the complex mantle-arc crust-atmosphere system: (1) What dictates the occurrence of prodigious 'supergiant' Cu-Au ore deposits? (2) Are some parental magmas more endowed in Cu and Au  than others, and what are the conditions that promote such a scenario? (3) Does the igneous (crystal/liquid) partitioning behaviour of Cu or Mo dictate or control the formation of ore deposits in more evolved magmas? (4) How atmophile are the heavy metals (Cu, Re, As, Sb, In, Sn, W) and what is their flux and loading of the atmosphere as aerosols? (5) If heavy metals partition and/or degass differently, is it  possible their ratios in volcanic aerosols or ash have some utility in predicting the real-time maturity of magma systems in an eruptive cycle, or can serve as a tool for volcanic prediction?

"The operation of power systems has undergone a major shift over the past decade with the deregulation of electricity markets around the world.  Thus, while in the previous vertical-integrated, single-owner structure, grid reliability was paramount, the current operating paradigm has shifted towards an environment where economic issues prevail over other system operating concerns; the blackout of August 2003 in the North East of North America clearly illustrates the effects of this significant shift in focus.  On the other hand, system security is accounted on most competitive markets by means of transmission system congestion limits defined rather conservatively, thus leading in some cases to market inefficiencies that result on unnecessary price spikes and even insecure system operation.  Finally, there is significant interest on increasing the use of environmentally friendly energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydrogen, as well as making electric energy consumption more responsive to price and environmental conditions.

    With the aforementioned issues in mind, the proposed research aims first at continuing our pioneering work, supported by a previous NSERC Discovery Grant, on a better representation of system security limits within market and system operating procedures and algorithms; this work will require the development of novel and practical optimization methodologies that are at the heart of the proposed market clearing and dispatch algorithms.  Second, our work will aim at developing techniques and algorithms for optimal operation of market participants, in the context of electricity and gas markets and a hydrogen economy.  Finally, the third major research objective will be to study how to properly account for the effect of environmentally friendly energy sources in the abovementioned techniques, in particular wind and solar while considering hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier.  

    The requested funds will be used to mainly support PhD/MSc students to add to the significant number of HQP we have trained, and who are badly needed in the electricity industry in Canada.

"Mirror-image molecules (enantiomers) have many identical properties, but they interact differently with light and with other enantiomers.  Despite their similarity, such molecules can have radically different impacts on living organisms.  This is the underlying reason for their importance in the pharmaceutical, agrichemical, and flavours and fragrance industries.  In a typical chemical synthesis, both enantiomers are produced.  It follows, then, that the separation of enantiomers is an important objective in chemistry.  

     The study of enantiomers is the central theme of our research program.  We specifically focus on two issues: the discrimination of enantiomers(telling them apart); and the understanding of the impact of mirror-image molecules on their environment.   To accomplish these goals, we employ statistical mechanics methods to explore mirror-image molecules in fluids, at interfaces and in liquid crystals.  Ab initio methods are also integral to our research as we undertake the development of force fields for the molecules of interest.  

     With these objectives in mind, funds are requested to support the following. First, we will expand upon our current research on the structure, solvation, and selectivity of chiral surfaces relevant to chiral chromatrography.   We have identified several surfaces of interest: some are commercially available (ULMO for instance) while others (proline-based) have been developed recently.  Our simulations will be directed at understanding their mechanism of selectivity and at predicting and optimizing their success.  Second, we will explore the impact of a chiral molecule on its environment:  Does the environment become chiral?  We propose to examine the conditions under which this chirality transfer is significant.   Finally, we are actively interested in chiral liquid crystals.  The mechanism by which a chiral dopant induces a detectable polarization in the host (solvent) medium is of interest.  Bent-core molecules are known to form chiral smectic layers and we also propose to examine in detail the mechanism for this chiral layering.  Four graduate students, and summer students, will receive specialized training in chirality as these questions are addressed.

"The milk produced by cows contains proteins, fats and carbohydrates of nutritional and functional significance for human consumers. The percentage content and yield of these components in milk, and consequently the economic value of milk, can vary widely according to the nutrition of the cow. The dairy industry in Canada expends considerable effort to manage the composition of milk through nutrition and breeding of dairy cows, of which there are approximately 1 million. Costs of feed total $2 million/day. The purpose of this proposal is to harness the techniques of computer modelling, cell culture and parenteral nutrient infusion to improve understanding of how the nutritive and non-nutritive qualities of cows' milk are determined so that the outcome of management interventions can be predicted with accuracy. A computer model of the delivery of nutrients to the mammary glands and their subsequent conversion into milk components will be updated and tested for its ability to predict responses of cows to infusion of glucose and a vasodilator into the mammary arterial supply. In mammary epithelial cells in culture, we will characterize how the enzyme hexokinase, which we have previously identified as being important for lactose synthesis, is moved around to accommodate needs for milk production. Then we will conduct comprehensive measurement and analysis of the multiple biochemical steps that convert extracellular glucose into lactose in an attempt to pinpoint where the biological control lies in the pathway. Lactose synthesis is the major determinant of daily milk volume. Finally, the mechanism by which the concentration of milk precursors outside the milk secretory cell is communicated to the protein-synthesizing machinery inside will be studied. We will observe the timecourse of events in the signalling pathway and then build a computer model to simulate those observations. The computer models we build can be used to  analyze potential efficiencies of milk production, strategies for manipulation of milk composition, and test our understanding of how milk is synthesized.","Production animale et produits animaux primaires","Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","Integrative Animal Biology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"This research program will look at three areas of application for resampling-based methodologies.  The first is to the analysis of gene expression data arising from designed experiments and in particular to the search for gene-environment interactions.  These interactions are widely hypothesized to exist in many complex diseases.  Finding these interactions at a gene-expression level, however has not been easy.  Standard parametric tests are not generally useful in this setting but permutation and resampling based methods can be used.   Most analyses of microarrays does not take into account the dependence between genes for a single individual.  There is a lot of information about gene function and relationships available, however.  I will examine how we can incorporate this information into the anlysis.  I will also look at ways to take genetic information into account in dealing with the multiple testing problem and estimating the false discover rate.



Another application that I will consider is the analysis of linear models fit using robust estimation techniques such as M-estimators.  These techniques are very useful when outliers may be present in the data.  Most of the results for standard errors, however, rely on asymptotic considerations.  In this program, I will examine how resampling methods can be used in this context for small factorial experiments.  I will also examine how these methods can be applied in the context of microarrays.



The third major area of application that I want to study is to long-memory time series.  This type of data arises frequently, particularly in economics and climatology.  In this program, I will look at ways to use bootstrap methodology to make reliable inference as to whether or not a time series is displaying evidence of long-memory and also for inference on other characteristics of long-memory time series.

"Dynamic models describe the rate of change of a process defined in time, space or some other continuum. They are widely used in medicine, engineering, ecology and a host of other applications. A central but difficult problem is estimation of dynamic models from observations. We propose a novel solution with several unique aspects. Importantly, the computational load is much lower than traditional methods, and the new method can be applied in situations where observations are missing for some components in the dynamic system. This proposal will consider two specific and important application areas as described below. 



Many HIV dynamic models have been proposed to describe dynamic interactions between uninfected cells, infected cells and the HIV virus. I will focus on dynamic model selection from noisy data. 



Biologists have known that each gene contains a particular set of instructions that usually code for a particular protein. Some genes interact with each other and compose a gene regulatory network. I will identify dynamic models for gene regulatory networks.



I also propose a new method to determine the effects of air pollutants on public health. The statistical methodology currently available may overestimate effects of air pollutants on public health and underestimate their precision. I will develop a general method which addresses these difficulties.



Additionally, software for these methods will be made publicly available.

"Among various types of fuel cell systems, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has become promising owing to its high efficiency, simplicity in design, and low-temperature operating condition. Since PEMFC design iterations relying on experiments are usually very expensive and time-consuming, computer modeling has become an attractive research direction, revealing effective heat and water management strategies are of top importance in achieving the required performance and lifetime of PEMFC operation. Our initial efforts have been made to build up a comprehensive 3D PEMFC model with the heat and water management issue taken into account. As an extension of our ongoing PEMFC research work, the project proposed here will be aimed at incorporating all important physical and electrochemical processes arising during the PEMFC operation into a complete PEMFC model to more realistically account for multi-dimensional, multi-species, and multi-phase transport under non-isothermal conditions. For this purpose, our particular attention will be paid to three new ingredients: (a) water phase change; (b) second order electrochemical kinetics; and (c) transient behavior. The resulting model is expected to be of highly nonlinear and system-level dynamic natures, the successful numerical solution of which will strongly rely on advanced numerical techniques. Therefore, in addition to the steam of PEMFC model development, another stream will be unfolding towards 3D finite element mesh adaptation guided by the a posteriori error estimation in response to the complex flow pattern and sophisticated transport phenomena. This will represent the first application of adaptive finite element methods to the PEMFC computer simulation, and help achieve an accurate numerical solution on meshes of well controlled quality using a significantly reduced amount of computational resources. The two streams of research efforts will be eventually merging and then implemented into a commercially available CFD code. The resulting software package is expected to serve for the PEMFC researchers to obtain useful information and gain valuable insight and guidance for design, performance optimization, and cost reduction of PEMFCs.

"The overall aim is to understand the cognitive structure of human memory through behavioural experiments and computational modeling, and the neural implementation of memory processes through measures of brain activity (electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging). Critical to my proposal, the connection between approaches will lead to novel insights into how neural processes drive memory.

    The theoretical challenge is to explain three important kinds of verbal memory: memory for items without regard to their inter-relationships (e.g., a grocery shopping list), memory for associations (pairs of items that go together, like SALT-PEPPER) and memory for ordered lists (e.g., names of the Prime Ministers in chronological order). We also aim to understand how interference from distracting items (e.g., remembering where you parked your car today while ruling out competing memories: where you parked yesterday). Both relational learning and interference pose large challenges both to normal human memory functioning and to memory-impaired individuals. First, we ask whether (and how) properties of single items might influence relational memory (associations and ordered lists) beyond simply influencing memory for the component items alone. Second, we ask what causes learning of one set of items to interfere with learning of a related set of materials. Both behavioural measures (accuracy and response times) and measures of brain activity (activity in memory-relevant brain regions as well as temporal signatures like brain rhythms) will be serve to test hypotheses about the cognitive basis of relational memory and interference.

    This research programme will help us flesh out our understanding of the cognitive basis of memory by informing cognitive psychologists as to how to extend computational models to account for data on relational memory and how to simulate interference and implement interference-resolving mechanisms. This will expanding our understanding of basic memory processes, as well as the brain-activity basis of memory, to a broader range of learning settings relevant to human experience.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"The research project aims at using mathematical programming to develop new algorithms for data mining and scientific discovery. This fundamental tool of operations research may be applied in two ways (i) to obtain algorithms giving a solution to a problem with a proof of optimality and (ii) to obtain heuristics providing optimal or near optimal solution but without any proof of optimality.



Mathematical programming will be used to continue the development of the system AutoGraphiX, a system that aims at helping the researcher in graph theory. AutoGraphiX has been developed since 1997, during my PhD thesis and was involved in more than 30 papers. The system first provides extremal (or near extremal) graphs eventually satisfying constraints, for a given problem. The so obtained graphs may be analysed and conjectures could automatically or interactively be made. This research will also continue on the relations finding part, which could not only be applied in graph theory, but also more generally in data mining.



When studying some problems with AutoGraphiX, a new technique of proof was found based upon linear programming and involving the number of edges with given end degrees as variables. We propose to use integer variables mij representing the number of edges between a vertex of degree i and a vertex of degree j. The new system ChemoGraphiX is actually being developed based upon this principle. 



We are also working on clustering. Clustering is one of the major techniques used in data mining. It is mainly used in marketing (segmentation) and localisation, but also in a variety of other applications where grouping observations is needed. We are actually working on the application of column generation to the clustering problem. This algorithm provides the optimal solution with proof of optimality.

"Self-incompatibility (SI) is one of the most widespread evolutionary devices used by flowering plants to promote gene exchange within a given species and avoid inbreeding.  In Solanaceous plants like Solanum chacoense the pistillar determinant to SI is an extremely polymorphic stylar extracellular S-RNase. The pollen determinant to SI has been identified as an F-box family member (SLF or S-locus F-box). It has been proposed that in compatible crosses,ubiquitin-mediated S-RNase degradation takes place. This, however, has not been unambiguously demonstrated. Indeed, it appears that the biochemistry and physiology underlying pollen rejection is a far more complex than previously suspected.

We use genetics, molecular biology and plant tissue culture to address basic questions about SI. These include: 1) How do pollen tubes discriminate between self and non self S-RNases? 2) Apart from the S-RNase, what other components are required for the SI reaction? 3) What is the role of the conserved glycosylation site present in the C2 region of all solanaceous S-RNases? 4) Why are multiple F-box genes present at the S-locus and what is their function? 5) How do the pollen and pistillar determinants coevolve to maintain SI? 

OBJECTIVES  1) Cloning and characterization of the pollen-S F-box gene and other F-box genes present at the S-locus of our genotypes. 2) We will develop a pollen transformation system involving highly regenerable genotypes of appropriate S-allele constitution and a pollen-specific promotor. These constructs in both sense and antisense orientation should help in identifying the pollen-S F-box, and other F-box genes. 3) We will produce by site-directed mutagenesis an S11-RNase without glycosylation sites. We predict that plants expressing such transgene will reject all types of pollen.

SIGNIFICANCE Additional knowledge on how the SI system works and evolve should open the way to exploit SI in production of hybrid seeds, fruit breeding, etc.

"Machine vision is a strategically important technology for emerging exciting fields such as robotic-assisted surgery, biometrics (e.g. face recognition), virtual environments and others.  Robust visual sensing is required for use with advanced strategies for motion control, sensor fusion, and pattern recognition using new approaches for embedded processing and communications among ""smart"" sensors in networks.  Challenges that are common to most applications, to various degrees, are those of illumination, reflections, and occlusions that introduce unpredictability for visual sensing in dynamic environments.  Examples are readily found in human-robot interaction and mobile, autonomous robot applications.  Reflective surfaces are encountered in robot-assisted surgery (eg. biological materials), in industrial automation (eg. manipulation of flexible sheet metal and glass), in metal machining, and in human face recognition (eg. skin and eyeglasses).    



The proposed work builds upon recent advances by my group and others in the areas of statistical pattern recognition subspace techniques (also known as ""appearance"" methods).  Independent component analysis (ICA), kernel, and support vector machine (SVM) techniques will continue to be used as a basis for novel and efficient processing solutions.  Development will also continue with our work on prototypes for distributed control and visual sensor networks that operate in the presence of transport delay, jitter and packet loss.  Of specific interest are applications of our prototypes to the difficult ""direct"" visual servo scenario, in which visual feedback alone is used to close a position loop for robotic guidance.  This strategy is appropriate when there is no access to positional information (typically from joint angle encoders).  Examples include redundant control for safety monitoring in robotic aerospace operations, for machines that are inherently dangerous due to size, and for human-robot cooperative interaction.  Machine vision-based control of nano-scale mechanisms and monitoring in microfluidics are intriguing and emerging potential applications of the proposed research.

"Interactions of pattern and process across landscapes are complex and reciprocal, and understanding their relationship often requires the quantification of important spatial and temporal properties of heterogeneity. Much of the quantification of spatial pattern in ecology to date has focused on landscape metrics, values computed from two-dimensional raster images typically representing land cover or land use. These measures, however, are not a panacea for earth system science analysis, and their application is difficult, in part because satisfactory statistical and geographic context is lacking. Yet the imperative to understand patterns remains.

     The long-term objective of my research program is to answer both basic and applied questions of environmental change by studying the causes and consequences of spatial and temporal variation in landscape-scale patterns and ecological processes. This research links earth system processes with statistical and spatial distributions of landscape pattern measures at multiple scales. I carefully choose applied questions that relate spatial pattern and ecological processes in various fields, then use the results to understand the general characteristics of pattern measures in real landscapes, My research facilitates the exploration of links between pattern and process, uses real-world land-cover data for statistical and spatial context of landscapes, and encourages the critical evaluation of the abilities and limitations of pattern measures. 

     To launch my research program, I have developed three essential medium-term objectives for the next five years. (1) How does the risk of Lyme Disease relate to fine-scale spatial patterns of land use?  (2) How do the spatial patterns of land cover differ across forested ecoregions of Canada, and how do these patterns relate to forest disturbance? (3) Which measures of pattern are powerful, useful descriptors from multiple data sources in real-world data sets? These objectives build a major research program with collaborations with both Canadian and international researchers, training multiple HQP ranging from undergraduates to postdocs, with results directly applicable to the future of Canada.

"Mechanisms based on compliant joints offer an alternative to conventional mechanisms based on the contact between rigid parts. The latter class of mechanisms has limited accuracy, due to the inevitable clearance and friction in its joints. Compliant mechanisms offer higher precision, which makes them a critical tool in disciplines such as micro- and nano-fabrication, biomedicine, optics, etc. On the other hand, these mechanisms still face some challenges: Their range of motions is often limited; they are sensitive to transverse loads; and their bandwidth is narrow. In this proposed research, we will develop compliant joints to improve the performance of compliant mechanisms in all three aspects. Compliant joints also have potential advantages such as lightweight and high anisotropy. These two properties can be combined to design prismatic joints that can be wound on winches, yielding a large span for a very small storage volume. Such joints can then be coupled with cables. This will result in a new class of parallel robotic manipulators exhibiting very large workspaces with respect to their retracted sizes. Envisioned applications for such mechanisms are in aerospace, for the deployment of structures, and robotic manipulation; but also in terrestrial robotics, with the potential development of mechanisms that are less bulky, well integrated into their environment, and less expensive.

"Many organizations and individuals are faced daily with the challenge of managing large corpora of text data. One important application is evaluative text, i.e. any document expressing an evaluation of an entity as either positive or negative. Evaluative information is strategic to decision making.  For instance, many websites collect large quantities of online customer reviews of consumer electronics. Although this literature can be of great strategic value to product designers, planners and manufacturers, the effective processing of this information remains a complex and time-consuming task. As another example, before traveling abroad, many users browse through travel-logs and online user reviews on hotels before they make reservations. However, there are so many evaluation web sites that users are awash in reviews. 

In these and many other similar situations, an automated solution has the potential to greatly reduce both the cost and time necessary to keep up with the growing amount of evaluative literature. Instead of asking the user to read through one review at a time, we propose to summarize the text reviews faithfully in a multi-granularity fashion, so that the user can pick the appropriate granularity level depending on her needs and time constraints. 

While there has been substantial work on how evaluative information can be extracted from text, little attention has been paid to how the extracted information can be effectively summarized and presented to users. In previous work we have started to explore this problem and in this project we propose to extend our work in different directions. In general, we aim at removing simplifying assumptions, at increasing the sophistication of the summarization process input, and at improving the quality of its output. A unique, distinguishing aspect of our approach is that it is multimedia and interactive. We aim to convey all the knowledge extracted with graphics, to point out the most important findings in natural language, and also to provide support for the interactive exploration of the corpus from which the knowledge was extracted.

"The main objective of this research is to fundamentally re-examine the methodology currently used to build Computer Algebra Systems, aiming to make substantial improvements.  Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) are well-known to be at the forefront of many new programming language technologies (generic programming, dependent types, first-class types, etc), as well adopting advanced software engineering techniques long before they are popular in the mainstream.  While the development of new, faster algorithms in the area of Computer Algebra has proceeded at a breakneck pace in the last few years, engineering issues have received less attention.  However, recent progress in such areas as type theory, denotational semantics for nominal languages, generative programming and automated testing can all be profitably applied to the construction of CASes.



We propose to re-examine, the current state-of-the-art in CAS development, and adapt current techniques in adjoining fields.  Just as simple type theory was too weak for Computer Algebra, it is expected that similar leaps will be needed in many areas of programming language theory and software engineering to properly address the very complex needs of a CAS.  First, we intend to concentrate on ``generic efficiency'', or how to write algorithms once using generative techniques to produce highly efficient specialized versions.  In our MetaOCaml experiments, the correctness guarantees are much higher than in traditional settings, while obtaining very efficient results at a fraction of the effort of developing new optimizing compiler techniques.  Secondly, current notions of polymorphism are not sufficient to appropriately express the kinds of ``genericity'' found in mathematics.  Approaches that frankly embrace developments in category theory will hopefully bear fruit.  This approach has worked very well for the development of powerful specification languages, we hope it can do something similar for programming languages.

"To date, most neurophysiology research has been limited to studying action potential-related events (i.e. spikes). Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the study of ""noise"" in the nervous system, manifesting as subthreshold, background fluctuations in electrical potentials. From a neuroengineering perspective. Noise captures important information pertaining to dynamical system changes, and may in fact offer tremendous insight into specific transitions between varying brain ""states."" In fact, it has become apparent that brain activity is more complex than previously thought, with different states characterized by unique properties under dynamical flux that are potentially measurable at different levels of the nervous system. These properties are thought to vary, for example, during normal physiological events (such as those associated with the different stages of sleep or during certain cognitive tasks) and also during disease-related processes (such as those arising in epileptic seizures). 

To deal with the challenging complexity of the brain, our research has taken a novel approach to the specific problem of classifying and identifying brain states, drawing on sophisticated electrophysiological, computational and neuroengineering methods to study ""noise"" arising at the neuronal, local network and global scales of the hippocampus. We will collect brain electrical activity from individual neurons in brain slices from rodents and human (removed at brain surgery), localized brain regions, and from larger brain areas (EEG). In this context, it is theoretically possible to classify, identify and potentially predict brain state transitions based on knowledge of the system's combined deterministic and stochastic behavior at any given time. This approach is unique in that it views the brain as a hybrid system capable of expressing both dynamical types of behavior to varying extents as it transitions from one state to another. The study of complexity inherent to brain dynamics has only recently become feasible thanks to recent developments in signal analysis and biomedical engineering. Thus, the fusion of physiology and neuroengineering principles is vital to our proposed research, and ultimately forms the cornerstone of our proposed research program.

"During embryonic development, a number of different mechanisms are employed to guide growing axons to their appropriate targets. One such mechanism is chemoattraction, wherein factors are released by the target tissues to attract growing axons. Results from recent work in our lab have identified a small, lipid-soluble vitamin A metabolite, all-trans retinoic acid (RA), as a critical factor in this process in newt spinal cord regeneration. Moreover, we have shown that this molecule has similar effects on outgrowth and directional growth (chemotaxis) on neurons from the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, suggesting some evolutionary conservation in the mechanisms by which developing and regenerating nerves find their targets. In this proposal, we plan to further investigate the role of RA and one of its nuclear receptors, retinoic acid receptor beta (RARb) in spinal cord regeneration in adult newts. Significantly, RARbeta is found in embryonic mouse spinal cords (which can regenerate), but is absent in adult mouse spinal cords (which lose this ability before birth. We have recently isolated and cloned the newt homologue of this receptor. We will determine its temporal and spatial patterns of expression in the regenerating spinal cord in amputated tails. We will also experimentally diminish the expression of this receptor in regenerating adult newt spinal cords by a process called RNA interference, to determine if regeneration is dependent upon its continual expression, as it appears to be in mammalian embryos. These studies will supplement those planned to determine the level of synthesis of endogenous RA in the spinal cords as a consequence of injury as well as those to determine the types of gene products regulated by the receptor in spinal cord cells. Understanding the trauma-induced  regeneration processes in the adult newt CNS, as well as identifying the factors required for neuronal outgrowth and directional pathfinding, are important for designing therapeutic strategies to prevent nerve cell degeneration and to restimulate the embryonic pathway in adult mammals, including humans.

"Wildfire, insect infestation, disease and commercial logging affect progressively larger areas of the world's forests, and resulting effects coupled with global climate change have created an increasing need for accurate tools with which hydrologists, foresters and watershed managers can evaluate disturbance and climate-related impacts on catchment water yield and ecosystem functions. To date, there has been no research examining how different disturbance types affect the forest floor and its water balance components, information that has important implications concerning wildfire potential. Further, there have been no studies examining the interactions between the spatial and temporal variability of understorey rainfall and the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture contents under different disturbance and regrowth scenarios.  



My proposed research program will thus be the first to simultaneously study the magnitudes of canopy and forest floor water balances components, as well as rooting zone water contents under disturbance and regeneration conditions. During the course of this study, new, more appropriate methods of determining the water storage capacity of forest canopies and the evaporation rates of water held in those canopies during rainfall events will also be derived, with a focus on developing approaches to better estimate these values in other forests. 



Process-based information as well as canopy and forest floor hydrologic simulation tools relevant to watershed-scale modelling developed through this research program will better prepare hydrologists, foresters, and watershed managers to assess the impacts of disturbance, re-growth and climate change on water yield and forest productivity, and help policy-makers to develop watershed management guidelines for post-disturbance landscapes across Canada and the world.

"The Arctic climate is undergoing rapid change: air and water temperatures are rising, sea-ice cover and glaciers are diminishing and precipitation is increasing. One example of how this will affect Arctic marine ecosystems is that projected increases in freshwater run-off may lead to more sediment discharge and thus higher turbidities. This change to the physical environment will affect primary productivity, however, not even the direction of change, positive or negative, is known. Over the past 10 years in the western Arctic Ocean, physical data and biological data have been collected, but only the physical data have been examined. This projects proposes to analyze these joint datasets to investigate the effects of turbidity on primary production in the western Arctic Ocean. Initially, the physical and biological data will be gathered and assembled into a database for analysis. The physical data will display broad general patterns such as the circulation and freshwater sources. The biological data will show which areas are most turbid and how turbidity is correlated with primary productivity. The second stage of this project involves data collection on oceanographic cruises aboard icebreakers. Ideas formed from analyzing the archived data will be tested through the collection of water samples at specific locations.  The third stage of this project will determine which physical processes affect the particle concentration and primary productivity. One approach is to use a coupled biological-physical model to diagnose how different physical forces affect the surface layer of the ocean, and in turn how those conditions affect the particle concentration and primary productivity. Climate change is occurring at a rapid rate in the Arctic, and it is essential that we understand the coupling of physical and biological systems -under present forcing- before they undergo dramatic alterations. The proposed project will contribute to our ability to assess the effects of sediment concentrations on primary productivity.

"Our research program develops new methods to fabricate microelectronic devices.  It is best defined by the two areas of technology it strives to advance: The first part of the program focuses on current demand for inexpensive devices, particularly lightweight, flexible devices that are wearable, can be rolled or folded to enhance their portability, or are designed to be implanted in the body.  Here, we develop simple, inexpensive processes to fabricate devices on both rigid and flexible polymer sheets.  The second part of the program looks toward future devices by defining a new fabrication strategy based on self-assembly, the spontaneous aggregation of components into larger, ordered structures without external (human or robotic) intervention.  Although the two parts of our research program target different segments of technology, they share a common foundation of key strengths in our lab - surface chemical modification, self-assembly, and soft lithography - and benefit from our expertise with surface analytical techniques to provide insight into the surface chemistry that influences and directs the fabrication processes.

"Although female mammals are born with a large number of immature follicles containing the eggs, the vast majority of these follicles will never reach ovulation.  Instead they will undergo cell death, under a phenomenon called apoptosis, and will degenerate.  Our laboratory is the first one to study the role of enzymes that degrade long polysaccharide molecules (called hyaluronidases) in this process of ovarian follicle development.  We have shown that these enzymes are capable of inducing cell death.  We also showed that mice lacking this enzyme have healthier follicles and ovulate higher number of eggs.  In the present work we will investigate in more detail how these enzymes regulate ovarian function.  First, we will verify what molecules are altered in ovarian follicle cells when comparing normal mouse with those lacking hyaluronidase.  Second, we will produce hyaluronidases of different sizes and study which one is more effective to induce cell death.  Then, we will investigate how feminine hormones control the amount of these enzymes in the ovary.  Results obtained in our project will help to better understand the functions of hyaluronidases in the ovary.  It is possible that a de-regulation of this enzyme is associated with infertility causes in humans or domestic animals.  Furthermore, results herein obtained will advance our knowledge on the process of follicle development and ovulation, trying to understand the suppressive role of hyaluronidases in the ovarian function.

"En serre et en p�pini�res, la production se fait essentiellement dans des pots de plastiques ou des sacs de culture contenant des substrats. Les substrats organiques deviennent de plus en plus importants, � cause des besoins croissants de recyclage des biomasses. Toutefois, les substrats organiques � base de tourbe de sphaigne ou � base de r�sidus peuvent accumuler des sels et � cause de cela, n�cessitent des lessivages fr�quents pour �viter des baisses de rendement. Les m�canismes d'accumulation dans ces substrats sont toutefois mal connus. Certains travaux sugg�rent l'existence d'une phase d'eau immobile importante dans ces substrats de cultures, phase qui r�duirait le lessivage efficace des sels et expliquerait les ph�nom�nes d'accumulation. Ces zones immobiles pourraient affecter le pr�l�vement des nutriments et la croissance v�g�tale. L'objectif g�n�ral du programme est de confirmer l'existence d'une phase immobile importante dans les milieux organiques, d'�valuer la contribution de cette phase � l'alimentation en eau des plantes et � leur pr�l�vement de fertilisants et finalement d'�laborer des mod�les d�crivant les mouvements d'�change des solut�s entre la phase mobile et immobile.

Ce programme de recherche est donc important pour l'industrie canadienne des serres, des substrats de cultures et pour l'environnement. Il permettra aussi la formation de personnel hautement qualifi� n�cessaire au d�veloppement de ces derniers secteurs.

"My research focuses primarily on the study of the first complex marine communities from the period just following the Early Cambrian. The Cambrian explosion represents the sudden worldwide appearance and rapid diversification of most major animal groups, starting about 540 million years ago. The record of this critical event is preserved in a series of exceptional fossil deposits, especially in China and Canada, of which the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale (a UNESCO World Heritage site in British Columbia) is certainly the most famous. 

Goals: The present NSERC discovery grant aims at expanding research programs in three main complementary areas: 1) to elucidate the ecology and affinities of dozens of specific fossil taxa in order to shed crucial light on: a) the origin and relationship of major animal body plans and, b) the acquisition of functional novelties during the Cambrian explosion; 2) to better understand the interaction between environmental signals and community composition in Cambrian biota; 3) to better understand community patterns at varying temporal and spatial scales, especially between sites from different paleogeographic and paleoecologic settings.

Methodology: 1) To study undescribed or poorly known fossil species using a combination of traditional (e.g., comparative anatomy and functional morphology) and modern (e.g., Backscattered Electron Microscopy) investigative techniques. 2) To obtain a high resolution geochemical data base from successive fossiliferous horizons in the Burgess Shale. Available species data (from my PhD work) will be compared quantitatively with new geochemical data. 3) To continue field-based investigations in China by expanding to new localities, in order to detect the influence of temporal and spatial factors on community composition.

Given the scope and challenges of my proposed research, I will continue to favour a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach by seeking to integrate new colleagues and students to my research lab.

"Terms like information society, information overload, information explosion, and information anxiety have become commonplace. We are generating information at an ever increasing pace and yet, even though most people want to be informed, all this information is often experienced as stress. I suggest that it is not the information itself that is the problem, but rather that we are bombarded with information in forms that are often hard to interpret. 

My research agenda is to produce interactive visualizations that enhance people's cognitive abilities, not only presenting information visually, but also providing people with capabilities for manipulating and exploring this information. An effective visualization provokes interpretation, exploration and appreciation, inviting direct interaction that reveals the information's contents. My overall objective is to: design, develop and evaluate interactive information visualizations so that they support the everyday-world practices of how people view, represent, manage, share and generally interact with information.

Information visualization investigates the possibilities the digital world affords for people's exploration of dense and complex information spaces. By increasing the focus on the interactive aspects of information visualization, I will be considering both how various interaction techniques can support an individual's information exploration as well as how small groups of people share, exchange and collaborate during information exploration.  I will work towards developing embodied interaction for information exploration, investigating how technology can be designed as a truly integral part of the real world environment. The challenge is to design information presentations so that they become an integral part of the everyday social practices of the people who use them. Success occurs when these systems support and maintain people's everyday activities within their real world context. Interactive information visualization considers the fundamental nature of information and how people can effectively interact with it through technology.

Nous venons de d�couvrir deux modes de r�gulation impliquant le NADP et le pool de plastoquinone : i) l'ajout de NADP+ au PSI cause un quenching significatif de la fluorescence et une diminution de l'activit� photochimique ; ii) les quinones substitu�es oxyd�es et les plastoquinones causent un quenching de fluorescence et diminuent l'activit� du PSI dans les fragments membranaires, ce qui indique que l'�tat redox du pool endog�ne de plastoquinone, en plus de r�guler le photosyst�me II, pr�senterait un effet similaire sur le PSI.

"Phylogeography is the study of genetic relationships in their geographic context. Mitochondrial DNA is a molecule inherited solely through the mother. New biotechnology now makes it possible to determine the complete mtDNA sequence of multiple animal species in a single experiment, which allows these maternal lines to be traced through time and space with great precision. We are examining the return to Atlantic Canada and the North Atlantic of fish and mammal species that would have been unable to survive during successive ice ages over the last several hundred thousand years. Studies of marine species like Atlantic Cod and Harp Seals indicate that their current distributions reflect events tens of thousands of years ago, whereas land animals like Caribou have returned to post-glacial Newfoundland only in the last few thousand years. These studies have practical implications for the stock and conservation management of these species.

"Polymer blends and filled thermoplastics are more and more used in an effort to obtain diversified and optimum properties for industrial materials. Most industrial polymer blends consist of immiscible components and the interface, morphology, orientation of domains and polymer chains as well as crystallinity affect considerably the performances of the final products. The morphology of the different phases in immiscible blends could be largely altered by the processing, due to coalescence and breakup of droplets or domains. Although most molten commercial polymers are highly elastic, the role of the elasticity of the polymer components on these phenomena is still totally obscure. Also, there is no successful rheological model to predict morphological changes in viscoelastic systems. The use of fillers in polymers such as glass fibers is a common operation for the production of high performance parts, to improve their mechanical strength, thermal stability and fire resistance.   However, the understanding of the dispersion and orientation of filler particles, as well as of morphological changes of the structure during processing, combined with the complex rheology of polymer matrices, remains a major challenge.  

In this project we will develop novel rheological methods and models to predict the performances of polymer multiphase systems and optimize their properties in relation to processing.  This innovative project will generate new and highly pertinent data, as well as new ideas for the modeling of these complex systems. More specifically, we will establish the role of elasticity of the polymer components on morphological changes of immiscible blends during processing. We will develop models to predict the effects of elasticity on blend morphology and to account for particle interactions and structures in colloidal systems and nanocomposites.

"A projective variety X is by definition the set of lines through the

origin in some n-dimensional complex space which lie in the set of common

zeros of a collection of homogeneous polynomials in n variables. A group

of n by n matrices which permutes these lines among themselves is said to

act on X. Schubert varieties are certain examples of projective algebraic

varieties which arise in certain situations where the group of upper

triangular n by n matrices acts. They are used to solve complex questions

about how projective varieties meet each other. The points where a

projective variety doesn't look locally like ordinary n space are called

singular, and it is usually a very important question to understand the

singular locus of X. One of the main problems proposed here is to

understand aspects of the singular locus of a Schubert variety involving

its tangent cone. Another problem is to study an algebraic structure

associated to a projective variety X, on which a group called a torus

acts, known as the equivariant cohomology of X. This structure reveals a

lot of information about the global geometry of X.

"Parallel manipulators (PMs) are robot manipulators with more than one articulated arm connecting the workpiece or tool to the ground. PMs have received considerable attention from the scientific and technical communities over the last two decades mainly due to their advantages in terms of load carrying capabilities, relatively low inertial properties, to name a few. Today, they are used in a number of industrial and laboratory applications such as machining centres, high precision and high speed pick and place operations, motion simulators, and much more recently, as surgery assistants. 

       As the choice of PM architectures is vast (and is constantly increasing) and the choice of dimensions for a particular architecture is essentially infinite, picking the right manipulator for a task is a complicated problem. Currently, this selection process is heuristic (i.e., mainly based on experience) as there is very little in terms of measures of performance that a designer could use to quantitatively compare different architectures.

       The research proposed here intends to tackle some of the main issues associated with the type and dimensional synthesis of parallel manipulators through the creation of a unified design platform. The ultimate goal is to automate part of the type and dimensional synthesis of manipulators. This will be accomplished by creating a modular analysis and design platform capable of comparing the suitability of different mechanisms for specific design criteria.

       Modules within the proposed platform will contain libraries of manipulators, performance measure and optimisation procedures. That is, new architectures or those within a library are to be optimised and quantitatively compared for the task determined by the designer. The same way a library of manipulators will be created, a library of performance measures will be developed and incorporated within the design platform. Task objectives will include parameters such as: reachable workspace volume, workspace quality in terms of dexterity, force and moment capabilities, manipulators' footprint, amongst many others.","Machinerie m�canique, machinerie lourde (y compris machinerie agricole, foresti�re, de construction)","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Mechanical Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","New Brunswick",Nouveau-Brunswick
"This initiative will address research needs of the British Columbia (BC) agricultural sector regarding management of arthropod pests. In particular, we will conduct research on the use of arthropod predators and parasitoids for biological control of key pest species. Insect and other arthropod pests continue to have substantial economic impact on agricultural production in BC. New pest species continue to be introduced into agriculture either through accidental introductions related to international trade, or as a consequence of range expansions associated with climate change. Management of pests via biological control provides a sustainable ecologically-based alternative to the use chemical pesticides in agriculture. The insectary industry produces predatory and parasitic arthropods used for biological control of pest species. BC and international companies mass rear biological control products for sale to greenhouse and other growers. In this program, new biological control products will be developed and existing products will be optimized to improve management of two key pests in greenhouse vegetable production: tomato psyllids and aphids. This work will have substantial benefits for both BC agriculture and the insectary industry. We anticipate the development of one or more new biological control products and optimization of the use of existing products during this program. We will also develop molecular-biology tools for aphid parasitois identification. These tools will be used to facilitate research and practice of bioligical control in greenhouses. Technology transfer of new products and technologies will be optimized by direct involvement of the greenhouse and insectary industries throughout the program.","Non disponible","Non disponible","Private Sector Advisory Board",1,"CCIP  ","College and Community Innovation Program","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

We have developed an electron multi-leaf collimator prototype that automatically shapes the beam and generates sequences of therapeutic fields through a remote-control graphical user interface. We will develop precise dose calculation algorithms that will be part of a fast iterative treatment planning system.



The clinical integration will occur through successive enhancements in the dose calculation algorithms, the improvement in direct planning techniques, and the introduction of inverse planning techniques. For clinical acceptance, the iterative planning algorithms will be tested and validated. Through intensity and energy modulation of field sequences, the objective is to improve the dose distribution in the target volume and to decrease the dose in normal neighbouring organs. These new treatment techniques will translate into better tumour control and reduction of adverse secondary effects.

"Bile acids are detergent synthesized in the liver and released into the small intestine to facilitate the absorption of dietary lipids. Bile acids are absorbed in the end of the small intestine to be return to the liver where they are recycled. Ten years ago, the discovery of a receptor for bile acids that regulates its production by the liver and absorption by the intestine markedly expand our understanding of this process. More recently, it has been found that bile acids receptor plays broader roles and often counteracts the deleterious effect of excessive bile acids.  Dr Carrier concentrates her research effort on nuclear receptors in which the bile acids receptor belongs, and she applies this field to intestinal physiology. Our preliminary results demonstrated that the activation of bile acids receptor reduced cell growth but promote specialization into functional epithelial cells lining the inside of the small intestine. 



The main objective of this research program is to better understand the roles of bile acid receptor in the regulation of 1) intestinal cell growth and 2) specialization into functional intestinal cells. 



Our research tools include 1) models of growing intestinal cells of normal and cancerous origin in which the bile acids receptor has been expressed and activated and 2) models of specialized intestinal cells in which the normally present bile acids receptor is either activated or abolished. 



We believe that this research will greatly improve our knowledge of the key roles played by bile acids on very important function of intestinal cells.

"My research program has been in the general area of design and analysis of repeated measures data, and has considered such issues as missing data analysis, fixed optimal design construction, and response adaptive designs. To broaden the scope, I have recently considered a more general model to construct optimal designs, as optimal designs are strongly model dependent. I also considered accommodating the heterogeneity inherent in the data.



In this proposal, one of the main goals of my research program is to extend the single-objective designs to multiple-objective designs to build response-adaptive designs. I plan to develop a new adaptive allocation rule that can provide estimates of the treatment effect contrasts accurately and optimally. Application of this work is found in a number of fields such as engineering, agriculture, biosciences, as well as biomedical sciences.



Specifically, I will construct repeated measurement designs under general models and document their impact on the traditional optimal designs. The general model will separate the carryover effects into two different types, one that results from the administration of the same treatment in the previous period and the other that results from the administration of the other competing treatment in the previous period. Most optimal designs constructed to date assume that these two types are equal. Further, they are based on fixed sample sizes. I will apply the Lagrange multiplier method and give recommendations on constructing two treatment p-period repeated measurement designs. Practically useful designs with fewer repeated periods will be summarized.

"The properties of molecules (their shape and size, the way they vibrate) are governed by quantum mechanics. According to quantum mechanics, the energy of a molecule can take only certain values. These values may be determined by solving an equation called the Schroedinger equation (SE). Using solutions of the SE one can deduce properties of molecules and interpret experimental results. The subject of this proposal is the solution of the SE associated with the vibration and rotation of small molecules. The SE is generally solved by representing the state of the molecule (a function from which one can calculate all observable properties) in terms of a set of known functions, called basis functions. It is difficult to solve because the number of basis functions required is very large.  If a large number of basis functions is necessary the computer memory required and the calculation time are large. The more nuclei a molecule has the larger the number of basis functions required. We propose methods of coping with very large sets of basis functions. The ideas I propose are necessary for studying molecules with five or more atoms: established methods are not adequate. We will study, for example, methane. Methane is of interest in astrophysics and in atmospheric science.  In the earth's atmosphere methane is a greenhouse gas. The greenhouse effect is the rise in temperature that the Earth experiences because gases in the atmosphere trap energy from the sun. Greenhouse gases cause the earth to warm up, like the inside of a car parked in the sun. Understanding methane better may help us to know to what extent methane is responsible for global warming. Using similar ideas we will calculate rates of reactions. From such rates one can understand the chemistry that takes places in the atmosphere. In the long term, it will be possible to use the methods we develop to understand proton transfer reactions in biological molecules.  In the course of doing this research, graduate students will be trained in computational chemistry, numerical analysis and computers. Because computational science is important for maintaining health and prosperity it is critical that Canada train scientists to develop and use modern numerical methods and modern computers.","Sciences physiques","Avancement des connaissances","Anal. & Phys.

"Statistical field theory is of great interest to physicists. Many exciting problems in physics today can only be studied using statistical field theory. One example is the quark gluon plasma which can be formed in a high energy collision of heavy ions. Such a plasma, or soup, of the elementary constituents of matter can teach us a lot about fundamental particle interactions.  Another example is the study of the early universe, where matter and energy existed at high temperatures. 



The study of statistical theories at finite temperature is mathematically complex. One of the major problems is that standard approximation techniques, like perturbation theory, are not applicable in their usual forms. Another problem is that fact that standard calculational techniques asume that the system has reached equilibrium, an assumption that is not justified for many of the problems we want to study. The traditional techniques of field theory must be modified to handle situations of this type.

"Modern salamanders provide the best living models of the anatomy and way of life of animals that evolved from archaic fish into the first terrestrial vertebrates 365 million years ago.  Most hatch from aquatic eggs, spend their early life in the water and metamorphose to terrestrial adults.  Unfortunately, there has been a gap in our knowledge of the fossil record of 200 million years between the oldest known modern salamanders and their possible ancestors among ancient amphibians. Within the last 15 years, this gap has been bridged by a host of fossils from deposits as old as 165 million years, at the base of the Jehol Biota in Inner Mongolia and adjacent China that yield fossils of feathered dinosaurs, some of the oldest mammals and archaic birds.  Because of the rapid burial of their bodies in anoxic sediments from repeated volcanic eruptions, the salamander remains are exquisitely preserved, including scores of complete, articulated skeletons, growth stages from larvae to adults, impressions of the eyes, external gills, and muscles.  In some the skin exhibits its original texture, the pattern of pigment distribution and costal grooves that in terrestrial salamanders conduct water from the ground to the sides of the body to assist in cutaneous respiration. Scores of specimens are available for study in cooperation with the Inner Mongolian Provincial Museum.  At least five, highly divergent lineages are known from the Daohugao locality that will be illustrated, describribed, and compared in detail with their putative ancestors among ancient amphibians, salamanders from elsewhere in the Jehol sequence and modern salamander families, with the assistance of gratuate and postdoctoral students and professional colleagues who are knowledgable in the anatomy, physiology, ontogeny and behavior of modern salamanders.  This study will vastly improve our understanding of the relationships and of evolution among all salamanders throughout their history.

"Photoacoustic imaging is a powerful technique for studying biological systems.  Photoacoustic images are capable of showing important indicators of tissue health and are helpful in the detection and diagnosis of diseases such as cancer. Dr. Carson's research team is developing a 3-dimensional photoacoustic imaging technology that is many times faster than currently available systems. It uses an array of ultrasound transducers to receive the photoacoustic waves generated by biological specimens in response to a bright flash of light from a laser. A computer interprets the signals from the transducers and reconstructs them into a 3-dimensional photoacoustic image that highlights areas of disease. The first objective of the research will be to increase the number of transducers in the array to improve the reception of photoacoustic signals and the quality of resultant 3D images.  The second objective will be to increase the range of frequencies that the array is able to sense, which will improve the quality of the 3D photoacoustic images further.  The third objective will be to obtain an accurate map of how well the transducer array signals from points in the imaging volume. To get this information, a miniature source of photoacoustic signal will be used to test of all transducers in the array. Movement of the source from point to point within the imaging volume with a robot arm will build up the required map. The research program will enable Dr. Carson and his trainees to improve greatly the quality of 3D photoacoustic images captured with their imaging system. This will make possible the capture of photoacoustic images of living samples with better resolution and image quality, and make 3D photoacoustic imaging practical for studying diseases such as cancer. Furthermore, the research program will give trainees the opportunity to learn how ultrasound, laser, and robotic technology can be combined to solve practical problems in biomedical imaging research.

"My research involves the application of Industrial/Systems Engineering techniques focusing on demand and capacity modeling and resource allocation issues in the health care industry.  I am particularly concerned about the tendency in health care to treat departments as independent silos of activity. For example, decision makers construct schedules for the operating rooms with little or no consideration of the impact this has on recovery rooms and wards. The Emergency Department functions almost independent of the rest of the hospital. Doctors are typically independent entrepreneurs who are motivated by the welfare of their patients and by their personal compensation; they are not primarily concerned with system efficiency.  Hospitals make operational decisions independent from nursing homes, home care and the community (including GPs.)  It is little wonder that the system is inefficient and cumbersome.  At the same time, the government is constantly bombarded with desperate requests for more money.  How should limited financial resources be distributed?  How should scarce human resources be allocated?  



A major focus of my research is to create quantitative decision support models to help policy makers and industry leaders make better informed decisions.  I am currently collaborating with three provincial governments (Ontario, Alberta and Newfoundland) in the design of tools to support wait list benchmarks for some of the major priority areas (cardiac, cataract, cancer, hip and knee replacement).  I am working closely with Cancer Care Ontario in a number of resource allocation models for cancer treatment centres to balance patient access with minimum expected volumes for the future.  My research goals aim to develop strategic decision support models that can really make a difference to our health care system. I plan to continue working on generalisable, portable models that can be used by more than one institution.","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Industrial Engineering",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"The objective of the proposed research is to investigate techniques for all-optical regeneration in fiber-optic communication systems operating at bit rates of 40 and 160 Gb/s. All-optical regenerators improve the quality of signals degraded by transmission impairments. They have the potential to enable networks with enhanced functionality and increase the maximum achievable transmission distance. For a bit rate of 40 Gb/s, conventional electrical time division multiplexing (ETDM) is used to combine several lower bit rate signals into a single high bit rate signal.  A technique known as optical time division multiplexing (OTDM) is used for a bit rate of 160 Gb/s since the required components are not available for ETDM. Methods for the demultiplexing of OTDM signals will be explored as a topic of considerable interest itself, but also as an essential requirement for enabling the research on 160 Gb/s all-optical regeneration. 

    Three doctoral students will develop theoretical and experimental skills highly sought by industry as they explore (i) regeneration for amplitude modulated signals, (ii) regeneration for phase modulated signals, and (iii) OTDM demultiplexing using electrically- and optically-activated gates. Graduates during the current five-year grant are employed at Ciena, Communications Research Centre, Gennum, Nortel Networks, Optelian, and Stanford University.

    The proposed research will advance the fundamental understanding of techniques for optical regeneration and demultiplexing. Thorough assessments of the system performance are topics of significant technical challenge and practical importance. If advanced technologies are to be deployed in fiber-optic communication systems, detailed study is required to fully understand the key issues that affect system performance. The potential impact of the research is significant given the role of global telecommunication networks in society today and the reliance of such networks on fiber-optic communication systems.

"Much of the phenotypic diversity in the wild is hypothesized to be caused by natural selection. Selection is unique among mechanisms of evolution because it can cause adaptation, the evolution of traits that enhance reproduction and survival. Athough Darwin proposed selection as a mechanism of evolution over 100 yr ago, only in the last 30 yr have biologists documented the process of adaptive evolution in present-day populations of species such as Darwin's finches. 



Working with a native wildflower, I am studying the ecological causes of natural selection, genetic constraints on evolution in response to this selection, and the importance of natural selection relative to other mechanisms that can cause evolution. My long-term research goal is to understand the contribution of natural selection to past phenotypic diversification by studying the process of adaptive evolution in present-day populations.

"The different steps of retroviral and lentiviral replications have been well studied. However, most of cellular proteins involved in the early steps of viral replication have yet to be  discovered. We propose to generate a library of cells mutagenized with a retroviral vector.  Retroviral vectors integrate into the host genomic DNA and can then inactivate genes. Compared to other mutagenic agents like chemicals or radiations, retroviral vectors will allow the easy identification of disrupted genes. We will then generate cell populations that are resistant to retroviral and lentiviral replication using  2 different strategies. Retroviral and lentiviral vectors containing CD19 and  H21G, a diphtheria toxin mutant with less activity, will be used to enrich for cells that are resistant to viral infection. Cells expressing CD19 will be depleted after each infection cycle with an anti-CD19 antibody and magnetic beads. Cells infected with H21G vectors will be enriched due to the cell toxicity mediated by H21G.  After several infections and cell sorting, cells will be cloned and disrupted genes responsible for the resistance to retroviral or lentiviral infection will be identified by PCR. Future studies will aim to pinpoint the exact role during viral replication of the genes identified from our screen.

This study should provide a better understanding of the trafficking involved in the early phase of retroviral and lentiviral replication, and it will allow the identification of cellular proteins involved in this process.

"A major initiative throughout Canada and North America is to provide travelers with better public transportation within the limits of government budgets.  As such, there is a need to evaluate the impacts of both new investments in transit infrastructure and changes in transit operations on passenger attraction (ridership) and operating efficiency.  One method for estimating these impacts is via travel forecasting models.  These widely-used models predict future travel patterns and system performance assuming all travelers choose the lowest cost means (for example by bus, streetcar, or private car) to arrive at their destination.  

The most commonly used models, however, are typically ill-suited for analyzing transit systems because they do not accurately represent the costs of traveling by transit.  Most models assume that transit operations (for example the minutes between buses) are fixed which may not be the case.  Unlike highway systems that become congested as demand increases, transit systems actually become more attractive to passengers as demand increases, because transit frequency of service can increase with demand, meaning shorter wait times and total travel times.  Naturally, transit operators have limits on how frequent the service can be on individual lines and must attempt to balance their service to demand throughout the system.  However, as ridership increases, revenues also increase and the transit agency may be able to increase its service along individual lines or in new areas.  These dynamics are not captured by conventional models.

The proposed research program will develop mathematical methods to represent the dynamic relationship among transit frequency, ridership, and fiscal constraints.  The models generated here can be used as part of, or in conjunction with, traditional travel forecasting models.  The research developed will lead to much more robust transit modeling capabilities for regions, cities and transit agencies, allowing governments to invest scarce resources in order to achieve the economic, social and environmental goals associated with greater transit ridership.

"The canopy plays a central role in the population, community and ecosystem dynamics of forests. Yet, forest canopies remain poorly understood because the difficulty of accessing tall trees has limited the number and scope of studies conducted directly in forest canopies. This dearth of information has in turn limited the development of models that can be used to simulate and elucidate the dynamics of forest canopies. I propose an integrated program of empirical and modeling studies, to be conducted in the forests of central Ontario, that will elucidate how crown plasticity and canopy structure influence the dynamics of northern hardwood forests. A mobile aerial lift will be used to conduct in-situ studies of crown plasticity, as measured by the lateral growth and recession of tree crowns. The empirical studies will be designed for two purposes: 1) to examine how crown plasticity enables trees of different sizes, ages, and species to compete for canopy space, and 2) to calibrate a model that realistically simulates crown plasticity and competition for canopy space. The key state variable of the model will be exposed crown area (the projected area of crown exposed to direct sunlight), a metric that reflects the outcome of competition and can be used to predict the subsequent growth and mortality of trees. Once calibrated, the model will be used to address the following questions. How does crown plasticity influence the development of size structure and the rate of self-thinning? Does crown plasticity decrease with age and thereby increase canopy turnover? Can productivity and timber yield be enhanced by management practices that optimize the allocation of canopy space among trees? While crown plasticity is widely acknowledged to be an important driver of forest canopy dynamics, it has not been thoroughly studied and has rarely been included in forest simulation models. The proposed field studies will provide new insights into the causes and consequences of crown plasticity, and the proposed modeling studies will provide a tool for exploring the interplay between crown and canopy dynamics and predicting the outcome of alternative management regimes.

"Western Canada is subject to the greatest seismic hazard in Canada. Some of the world's largest earthquakes have occurred in this region, including the magnitude (M) 9 Cascadia subduction earthquake to the west of Vancouver Island in 1700; the M=8.1 earthquake just to the west of the Queen Charlotte Islands in 1949; and the M=7.9 Denali Fault earthquake in Alaska, which ruptured to within 100 km of the Yukon border. Other large, damaging crustal earthquakes include the 1918 M=7 event and the 1946 M=7.3 event, both on Vancouver Island, and the M=7 earthquake just south of the Fraser Valley in 1872. These crustal earthquakes pose a threat to the population centres of southwest BC, and also to critical infrastructure throughout western Canada, including pipelines in the Yukon and NWT, hydroelectric dams and transmission infrastructure throughout western Canada, and port facilities in BC. The importance of understanding crustal earthquakes was demonstrated by the M=6.9 Kobe, Japan earthquake that caused more than $300B dollars in damage. However, crustal earthquakes in western Canada are enigmatic. There are large-scale crustal faults, such as the Denali Fault, Tintina Fault, and Fraser Fault - however no significant amount  of seismicity has been observed on these structures during historic times. In southwestern BC, where large crustal earthquakes have occurred (e.g., 1946 central Vancouver Island) - there is no evidence for surface faulting, and so the ""active fault"" may be hidden at depth. The long-term goal of this proposed research is to better understand crustal earthquakes in western Canada - where can they occur, how large can they be, how often might they occur, and how will the ground shake. We will do this by  identifying active structures, mapping the slip distribution and rupture process along faults, and mapping the earthquake-generating stress field. The results of these studies will be incorporated into seismic hazard maps in the National Building Code of Canada, and will provide waveforms useful for engineering applications. This, in turn, will help to minimise losses and economic impact of future earthquakes in this region. The benefits to society from this type of research can be in the billions of dollars.

"Exploration and Cognitive Processing of Real-World Scenes



The world around us constantly changing and we have to keep up with that change.  Whether it is driving in a car or searching for your wallet in the living room, our visual system has to be able to manage the incoming information and integrate relevant information from our memories.  This project is aimed at investigating the underlying perceptual and cognitive processes that allow us to perform at such a high-level.  In a series of experiments, two main processes will be addressed:  the initial rapid processing that characterizes a scene in less than a single glance and the subsequent exploration (as we look around) that is oriented towards useful information.  For each of these processes, my students and I will investigate what types of information are most important, how information is updated, and how previous knowledge affects how we see new information. The results of this investigation will expand our basic knowledge of how the visual system functions in complex environments and can be applied to developing artificial systems to successfully manage complex visual information (e.g., searching surveillance images for a specific target or sorting images by meaning) or towards the development of programs to help processing of complex visual information in special populations (e.g., ADHD, autism or older adults).

"One of the most important ways an industrial firm, retail outlet, or government agency can enhance its chances of success is to identify good facility locations.  One approach is to use location-allocation models that optimally locate service or manufacturing facilities and allocate demand or supply to them: the intent is to find the best set of locations and service areas for these facilities.  Location/logistics models are defined by their objective functions and what are thought to be realistic constraints.  However, the objective functions and the constraints in the classic models tend to be quite simple.  Consider, for instance, the most popular location-allocation model, the p-median, where the objective is plainly to minimize the distance (or travel cost) between demand and facility points.  In many real-world situations, assumptions as uncapacitated facilities, demand points that are allocated to the closest facility (traditionally a constraint in the optimization models), and point-to-point service are unrealistic.  Relaxing or removing some of these assumptions is critical to enhancing facility location modeling and optimization in an attempt to generate solutions that better incorporate real-world conditions.","Production et gestion des op�rations","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Industrial Engineering",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"The proposed research focuses on acoustic studies of motor neuron disorders that yield perturbations on the speech produced depending on the location of the lesion in the peripheral or central nervous system. This investigation is based on clinical evidence of a direct correlation between the location of the neurological lesions and the perturbations observed in the produced speech, which enable the determination of unique acoustic patterns that describe the complaints. The neurological disorders that will be studied include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson disease among other neurological impairments. Diagnostic and a detailed characterization of the acoustic perturbations at very early stages of these disorders are important for rehabilitation, treatment and research. 

The research program will develop the algorithms and tools required to implement a new methodology to assess the acoustic perturbations perceived from the pathologic speech using automatic instrumental techniques. The research will combine speech processing, pattern recognition and data analysis algorithms to automatically explore all aspects of the speech production mechanism and derive the acoustic perturbations manifested in the recorded utterances that characterize the studied disorders. By automatically classifying the disorders based on the extracted acoustic data and making relevance analyses of the input features, diagnosis and a detailed characterization of the acoustic perturbations will be achieved. 

The automatic instrumental approach will overcome the limitations of subjective methods often used in clinical studies for assessing the severity of the speech perturbations and will provide a consistent method of modeling the perception of the acoustic perturbations. Non-linear assessment algorithms will be studied to maximize the classification performance, enable efficient analysis of relevant acoustic dimensions and provide alternative information on the underlying mechanisms relating the studied disorders. This will provide effective paths to improve research and rehabilitation procedures.

"Bacterial pneumonia is the most common and economically important disease of Canadian feedlot beef cattle, and is a major reason for preventative use of antibiotics in the beef industry. The disease occurs mainly in the first 2-3 weeks after calves arrive in feedlots, and results from interactions among bacteria, viruses, stress, adverse climatic conditions, and genetic factors. This project encompasses two aspects of this disease: innate immunity against bacterial infection in the lung, and the pathogenesis of a particular form of bacterial pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma bovis. The objective of the innate immunity component of the project is to identify innate immune proteins in the lung and blood that contribute to resistance/susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia. Genetic variation in these proteins will be evaluated for their association with disease susceptibility, and tests to measure these proteins may be of practical benefit to identify calves at increased risk of disease, and permit more focused antibiotic treatment. The second component focuses on Mycoplasma bovis pneumonia, which has recently emerged as a major cause of chronic antibiotic-resistant pneumonia in Canadian beef and dairy calves. The project is an intensive examination of naturally occurring cases of this disease, investigating immune responses and changes in the numbers and genetic type of Mycoplasma bovis bacteria in the lungs of cattle, comparing calves that develop disease to those that remain healthy, and changes that occur prior to disease and during acute and chronic stages of pneumonia. The genotype and antimicrobial resistance of contemporary and archived isolates of Mycoplasma bovis will be compared for differences that may explain the recent emergence of this disease. These results are important to understand how the disease develops, and specifically whether control measures should be directed at the predisposing causes of disease or at virulent strains of Mycoplasma bovis.","Production animale et produits animaux primaires","Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Ontario,Ontario

"Total joint arthroplasty, i.e., the complete artificial replacement of a natural joint (specifically hip and knee), is a surgical procedure that generally provides relief of pain and restoration of joint function. In 2003, more than 50,000 hip and knee replacements were performed in Canada, and 35% of these procedures were performed in patients less than 65 years old. Along with this increase in life expectancy has come a need to prolong prosthesis survivorship to avoid complex revision surgery and its associated morbidity and mortality. One of the major causes of total joint replacement failure is aseptic loosening due to bone destruction around the prosthesis (periprosthetic osteolysis). Wear particles, which characteristics depend on the implant type (metal, polyethylene, ceramic) have been demonstrated to be largely involved in the induction of periprosthetic osteolysis by stimulating the surrounding cells, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators. It is, therefore, important to better understand and modulate the mechanisms leading to this unfortunate and sometimes disastrous biological response. The development of engineered nanostructures (or nanospheres) offers the possibility to target specifically the cells involved in the osteolysis cascade and control their response.

The overall goal of the proposed research program is to modulate periprosthetic osteolysis in order to prolong prosthesis survivorship. To fulfill this general objective, the research will be divided as follow: 

1. Identification of the biological mechanisms involved in periprosthetic osteolysis.

2. Modulation of the cell response and molecular mechanisms involved in periprosthetic osteolysis by using engineered nanospheres, specifically designed to target those cells and mechanisms.

This research will lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches using nanotechnology to modulate periprosthetic osteolysis. Results will also significantly add to our current knowledge on implant failure mechanisms and lead to the prolongation of implant longevity.","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Mechanical Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Bitter Crab Disease/Syndrome (BCD/BCS) is a fatal disease of the snow crab and other crustaceans that is

caused by a parasitic dinoflagellate. Currently infecting over 30 species of crustaceans worldwide, several of

which are commercially important, the disease is continuing to spread. In addition to producing mortalities,

BCS also affects product quality in terminal stages of the disease, causing a bitter taste to the meat.

Consequently, BCD has the potential to affect commercial and recreational snow crab fisheries and the

economies of Newfoundland and Labrador which have already experienced a major shift in target species

(from Atlantic cod to shellfish). Although BCD has been recognized since the mid-1980's, previous research adopted a ""shotgun"" approach where issues were not prioritized and often not coordinated. As a result many unknowns exist about the

parasite and the resulting disease. For example, major unknowns include the life history of the parasite outside

the crustacean host, the method of infection, disease progression in a susceptible population, and the impact

that this disease may have on population abundance and distribution of snow crab. This proposal takes a

systematic approach in attempting to address the above issues through focused laboratory and field experiments

and the collaboration of industry and research and management entities. The goals of the proposed research are better understanding of the disease, the biology of the parasite and the impact that BCD may have upon recruitment, abundance and distribution patterns of snow crab. The information gained from this project will be provided to resource managers and industry and should significantly enhance efforts toward sustaining an important Atlantic Canada fishery.","Oc�ans, mers et estuaires",Environnement,"Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Fishery Industry","2 & 3","STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Prince Edward Island","�le-du-Prince-�douard"

"Nuclear medicine imaging techniques, with their molecular characteristics and exceptional sensitivity, play an important role in modern medicine. By providing in-vivo functional information about the biodistribution of tracer molecules labeled with radioactive isotopes, they allow not only for identification of altered anatomy and function to help diagnose disease, but also for locating molecular receptor sites, studying biological markers expressed by diseased cells, and monitoring the presence and extent of specific disease processes. The main objective of the research program of the Medical Imaging Research Group (MIRG) is to use advanced physics, mathematics and computer science (jointly called here ""Computational Sciences"") to develop new and improved methods for diagnostic nuclear medicine, ones suitable for use both in everyday clinical practice and in medical and molecular research. MIRG's research is in several closely related areas: quantitative imaging, dynamic functional imaging, data analysis and visualization, and the investigation of novel imaging techniques. Some of our future goals include: (1) the development of an exact dosimetry technique based on our unified quantitative SPECT method (qSPECT) combined with an automatic 3-D volume segmentation routine (level-set based and similar methods) and detailed Monte-Carlo calculations of internal dose due to energy deposition by gamma photons, X-rays and electrons, (2) further research on the application of modern mathematical optimization techniques with different regularization schemes to reconstruct a multidimensional series of dynamic images, (3) development of software, construction and testing of a Compton camera. The new generation of cameras, based on detection of Compton scattered photons and using solid state detectors can potentially provide means for truly molecular imaging with sub-millimeter resolution (with the goal to image particular cells).","Appareils et instruments m�dicaux","Proc�d�s et produits industriels",Interdisciplinary,3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Founded in 1979, Empress Software Inc is a privately held software development company headquartered in Markham that develops and supports the Empress Embedded Database for software and device embedded systems applications, including image and voice management, telecommunications, medical systems, network management and geographical information systems. In recent years, Empress has had requests to provide a text searching facility. Traditional database text

searching (focused on the text content) search text meta-data (author/performer, title, publisher, etc.) associated with large binary data, in the form of text-embedded documents (.doc, .pdf, .rtf, etc.), music, video, games, and so on. This type of searching should be familiar to anyone visiting sites as Amazon.com, BestBuy.com and YouTube.com. Frustrations experienced by visitors to these sites are also be familiar: excessive false positives and seemingly random ordering of results. Dedicated sites such as Google.com and Yahoo.com often provide better experiences, but their technologies do not readily embed in other applications In response to these requests, Empress has added a text searching facility on top of the Empress engine. The facility, however, is not a complete solution. It provides only for the storage of record identifications (ids) with sets of uninterpreted text tags and the retrieval of record ids from a query set of tags. To achieve a better solution Empress needs new technology for text searching and faces several immediate challenges which we will investigate: Challenge #1: Extraction of tags from meta-data; Challenge #2: Design of the efficient storage for meta-data tags; Challenge #3: Extraction of tags from the user query; Challenge #3: Extraction of tags from the user query; and Challenge #5: How to determine the quality of the results?","Syst�mes d'information et technologie de l'information","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Ontario Internal Decision Committee",1,"EGP   ","Engage Grants Program                                                                               ",Ontario,Ontario
"The applicant, Nick Cercone, moved to York in September 2006 as Dean of Science & Engineering. The computing environment he built at Dalhousie was needed and left behind. Currently Cercone supervises1 full time post-doc, 1 part-time post-doc, and 8 graduate students (6 Ph.D. students and 2 M.Sc. students). Two talented York faculty, Aijun An (data mining, machine learning) and Jimmy Huang (information retrieval) join this proposal; they supervise a dozen students. As faculty members with related interests and critical need for equipment, the three will share/maintain their research computing environment.



This group supervises current students in several projects, notably ""Finding best evidence for evidence-based best practice recommendations in health care"" and ""Ultra-Large scale systems (ULS) with application in evidence based medicine (EBM)"". For example, the goal of the second project is to develop and manage ULS, our role is to develop methods and advanced tools to help doctors/patients find relevant information, discover interesting medical database patterns from and obtain recommendations for cost-effective treatments.



A primary long-term goal of this research is to develop a decision support system for EBM management, quality control and best practice recommendations for health applications. Research results will improve access, management and manipulation of information in a networked environment by: (1) building prototypes for adaptive information extraction, text/data mining from (online) documents to find evidence on which to base best practice recommendations; and  (2) employ machine learning techniques, e.g., multiply sectioned Bayesian networks, to infer probabilistic interpretations to validate evidence. 



This equipment will support this group's research, and their students and post-docs.

"A thin layer of mucous separates the luminal surface of the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts from the outside world, making these surfaces of the body the most prone to infection and inflammation. My laboratory, using the rat prostate as a model system, has studied the role of bacterial virulence factors, which are weapons used by bacteria to attack the host, in helping bacteria to establishing chronic infections by forming biofilms at these surfaces. Biofilms are bacteria growing as interactive colonies within a slime layer attached to tissues or implanted medical devices that are less susceptible to the host immune system and to antibiotic treatment, thus allowing them to persist. We have developed new technologies for assaying antimicrobial susceptibility of biofilms, which has resulted in a multifactorial model to explain the resistance of biofilms. In future, we will continue to study infection and inflammation at mucosal surfaces and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance of biofilms.  First we will expand the use of the prostate as a more general model of mucosal inflammation to study Pseudomonas biofilm infections as seen in cystic fibrosis (CF). Since the normal lung clears Pseudomonas infections readily we will use the prostate, a mucosal surface more susceptible to biofilm formation, as a model of these infections of the CF lung. We will also move the model into the mouse, which has become the prime model to study the immune response. This will allow us to better ascertain the contribution of the host's immune system to the inflammatory disease process initiated by biofilm formation. Secondly, we will continue our study of the adaptations of bacteria in biofilms that result in their reduced antimicrobial susceptibility by characterizing the proteins made by biofilms under challenge in order to define the mechanisms initiated to stave off elimination by antibiotics. Further we will look at the role of enzymes involved in limiting damage from reactive oxygen species in contributing to the stability of biofilms under antimicrobial stress. We anticipate that these studies will allow us to better understand and in the long term control chronic mucosal infections.

"This application is to request funding for a flow cytometer. Flow cytometry is the method of choice for a variety of measures to be done in heterogenous cell populations and complex samples, because it allows identifying characteristics and identity at the single-cell level. We wish to apply this technique to various aspects of our research programs. Research aimed at deciphering brain function, and cross-talk between the brain and other physiological systems (e.g. the immune system), is critical for understanding mental and neurological disorders. Since highly complex processes are involved, accurate and efficient ways of monitoring cell functions are needed. In particular, one needs to assess gene expression and cell composition in different tissues under various pathological conditions, as well as in response to drugs and infection. The research performed using the flow cytometer requested in this application will lead to a better understanding of how brain works, including biological timing, learning and memory, brain development, and mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. Another benefit of acquiring this equipment will be improved training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows: the use of the flow cytometry technology will constitute an important part of their diversified training in neuroscience.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Genes, Cells and Molecules",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Processes that are inherently transient or are operated in an unsteady-state manner are abundant in the resource industries. Examples in chemical engineering include batch processes and semi-continuous processes that conduct frequent state changes. In the energy sector, transient systems will also be called upon to play a key role in future years, as many alternative technologies rely on unsteady energy resources.

    Dynamic optimization is the sole technology capable of optimizing transient processes, yet it is seldom used in industry. This research aims to further develop this technology for the design and realization of high-performance model-based control systems at a reasonable engineering effort. Our methodology combines advanced dynamic real-time optimization techniques that promote feasible and optimal process operation despite the presence of uncertainty, with deterministic global optimization techniques that guarantee consistent location of global solutions to the dynamic optimization subproblems. On the application front, these developments are applied to complex chemical processes, where dynamic optimization is critical to achieve the performance objectives. Special emphasis is on a novel application in optimal operation of microalgal processes for biodiesel production, which is particularly challenging owing to the transient and distributed nature of the process, the modeling uncertainties, and the large diurnal variations.

    The growing capability to optimize transient processes both efficiently and reliably during run time will have quite broad practical implications. In the area of process operations, there is hope for developing safe, environmentally and economically sustainable chemical and biochemical processes, despite the presence of uncertainty, using detailed dynamic models. It is believed that this generic optimization capability also has the potential for significant impact in a broad range of engineering disciplines and applications. Finally, this research will help promote dynamic optimization acceptance by industry through student training and by engaging the interested members of the research community.

"Information from the natural environment reaches us through our senses and is decoded by the higher brain. Understanding the set of transformations by which incoming sensory stimuli are transformed into trains of action potentials and how these trains are decoded in the higher brain, the neural code, is a central problem in neuroscience. It has been observed across species that neurons in higher brain areas are more selective to incoming stimuli than neurons in peripheral areas. For example, neurons within the hippocampus are selective

in their responses to pictures of individuals (e.g. a particular neuron might respond to a picture of Jennifer Anniston and not a picture of Halle Berry). This is contrary to photoreceptors that will in general be activated by both sets of images. It is said that a neural code is dense when neurons respond to a wide range of stimuli. On the contrary, a neural code is said to be sparse when neurons respond to only a few stimuli. In general, neural codes in the periphery are dense while neural codes in higher areas are sparse. There is great interest in

understanding the mechanisms by which this occurs which is the focus of this grant proposal. I propose to study these mechanisms using the well-characterized electrosensory system of weakly electric fish. In particular, natural stimuli for these animals are easily mimicked in the laboratory and will give rise to appropriate behaviors. We propose to record from midbrain neurons which we know are more selective in their responses than afferent neurons and perform pharmacological and physiological experiments to determine the cellular and network mechanisms that enable midbrain neurons to be more selective (i.e. more sparse). The

results from this research will undoubtebly be applicable to other species as well as humans given important similarities between the electrosensory system and our auditory system.

"Entamoeba histolytica is a parasitic protozoan that causes the disease amebiasis characterized by bloody dysentery and liver abscess.  About 1% of the world's population carries the parasite, resulting in 50 million cases of invasive disease and 100,000 deaths per year.  It is among the 10 leading causes of mortality worldwide.  At present, it is not known why the parasites are not controlled during infection.  However, patients who are drug-cured are resistant to reinvasion suggesting that protective immunity occurs.  Clinical and experimental studies indicate that cell-mediated immunity mediated by macrophages (the white blood cells that kill the parasites) is important in control and resistance to re-infection.  Thus, a priority to the control of amebiasis is to develop a safe and effective vaccine.  The major surface molecule on the parasite involved in the initiation of disease is the galactose-binding protein called the Gal-lectin.  This protein is immunodominant and is recognized by serum from patients who had/has the disease.  Immunization of animals with the Gal-lectin protected them against a challenge infection suggesting it is a good vaccine candidate molecule against amebiasis.  However, it is not known what portion(s) of the Gal-lectin elicits the protective immune response.  We hypothesized that specific portions of the Gal-lectin stimulates cell-mediated immunity for host defense against the disease.  Accordingly, the specific aims of this study are: (1) to identify the critical regions of the Gal-lectin that stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses and, (2) to identify the host cell receptor and the signaling events involved in protective immunity.  Our strategy is to first fine map the protective epitopes of the Gal-lectin using a panel of monoclonal antibodies that recognize distinct domains.  Secondly, we will identify the receptors on dendritic cells that stimulate a protective immune response by using cells and animals that are deficient in the putative receptor(s) for the Gal-lectin.  Characterizing the receptor and the signaling events involved in stimulating the right immune response is important in developing strategies to enhance vaccine development against this devastating disease.

"This research proposal aims at developing and applying another alternative for surface modification using stable conducting materials such as polythiophenes. Our strategy is based on the deposition of protective conducting layers through electrochemical oxidation on the surface of the electrode. The proposed new approach will help overcome difficulties encountered with traditional methods used for direct organic modifications of solid surfaces and target the deposition of convenient functional groups or bioorganic/biological molecules. The presence of functional groups allows an easier functionalization of the polymers surfaces as well as the introduction of new molecules with different electronic/optical properties. 

Our approach requires a variety of novel monomers for surface derivatization. To this end, a new methodology for the synthesis of conducting polymer precursors using green chemistry will be developed. These precursors will also generate a series of materials which we expect to exhibit high stability in both states (doped and undoped), low band gap energy and wide range in optical properties, which are important for the construction of biosensors and optical devices.

The characterization of the deposited materials onto electrode surfaces will be performed using cyclic voltammetry, scanning electrochemical microscope-tip, UV-vis, Infrared, scanning electron microscopy and XPS measurements. The proposed convenient strategies for the organic modification of conducting surfaces will be a powerful tool for recognition purposes. Moreover, studies described in this research program will provide valuable physico-chemical data necessary for the design of microchip devices.

"Autonomous agents are computer systems that are capable of independent action in open, unpredictable environments. Nowadays, concurrent and distributed systems are very common, it becomes obvious in this case that a single autonomous agent is insufficient. Many applications, if not most of them, require multiple autonomous agents, called also Multiagent Systems. In such computing systems, knowledge, action and control are distributed among the agents, which may cooperate, compete or coexist depending on the context.

    Agent and multiagent systems are considered as a significant area of interest for such applications as telecommunications, robotic systems, information elicitation and management, Internet and electronic commerce, computer games, information retrieval and filtering, user interface design, industrial process control, open systems, etc.  The successful adoption of these systems in all these areas will have a profound impact both on Canadian industries, and also on the way in which future computer systems will be conceptualized and implemented.

    In the long-term, our project is engaged in a program of research aimed at deepening our understanding of autonomous software agents which can act and interact; and at developing practical methods for designing such agents. The major significance of such project is that it imports some powerful practical and theoretical ideas into the core of computer science. 

    In the short term, our main goals are: (a) to determine important issues relative to agent/multiagent planning and learning; (b) to develop methods and algorithms for those issues and, (c) to test and validate those methods and algorithms on realistic complex applications as: robotic assistant for persons with disabilities; robotic systems, intelligent vehicles and adaptive UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles); resource management in rescue environments; and dialogues and communication between man and machines.

"For many years, I have been leading an interdisciplinary program on advanced plasma sources for thin film processing. From the very beginning, it has been built on a deep knowledge of plasma science and on an exhaustive know-how in materials processing (synthesis and etching) and characterization. I intend to capitalize on my previously successful work and continue to excel in combining plasma and materials science and technology for the conception of innovative materials processing and for the fabrication of advanced RF and photonic components. 

The proposed research program focuses on five inter-related projects, namely: i) intensify my effort on the understanding of laser-produced plasmas (LPP) from atmosphere to vacuum environment at various laser pulse durations, ii) explore the synthesis of new thin films by LPP, in particular potassium silver tantalate to improve the performances of tunable microwave devices based on ferroelectric materials, iii) investigate the CdS and PbS nanoparticles synthesis using LPP and to compare their photoluminescence characteristics to those of nanoparticles produced by chemical methods, iv) pursue the theoretical and experimental studies of high-density plasmas for nanometer pattern transfer onto various thin films including ferroelectric and nanoimprint template materials, and v) integrate novel plasma-based materials processes and lithography to develop advanced devices such as low-loss miniaturized tunable microwave circuits and ultrafast optical switches. 

This research program will (i) contribute to a better understanding of the physical and chemical mechanisms involved in various plasma-based materials processing, (ii) foster focused research in materials processing and device fabrication consistent with the specific needs of the high technology Canadian industries and (iii) train people uniquely qualified to respond to the technical challenges facing Canada.","Sciences des mat�riaux","Avancement des connaissances","General Physics",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Canada's proposed Clean Air Act tabled in the parliament on October 19, 2006, proposes a long term Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction target of between 45 to 65% from the 2003 levels by 2050. However, according to the 2006 report on Climate Change, prepared by the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, as of 2004, Canadian's GHG emissions are up by 26.6% above 1990 levels.  For Canada to be able to achieve its GHG reductions goals, development of new technologies and adoption of existing energy efficient technology in energy production, transportation and use, is a must. I propose to undertake two important projects, one with near term application potentials to help Canada meet its Kyoto objectives through carbon capture and sequestration, and a second one with a longer time horizon for possible application.



The main objective of the first project is to develop design and scale up criteria for mass transfer enhancement by mixed solvents in Carbon Dioxide absorption.  The aim is to provide design tools for industrial use within the 5 year time frame of this project.



The second project to be undertaken is the development of a hybrid absorption/membrane system. The membrane to be used will be a chemically reactive membrane with superior Carbob Dioxide separation efficiency. At the end of the five year period, it is anticipated that a hybrid process involving the reactive membrane will be ready for pilot testing.

"This research program (to be called 'new approach') intends to develop a more realistic approach to metal toxicity to freshwater aquatic organisms and to humans, which will be applicable to all metals in natural waters. The new approach will be based on rates of dissociation reactions of metal complexes. The new approach will calculate the coupled flux of diffusional transport of metal M and metal complex ML to the surface of the organisms instead of the current practice of calculating the chemical speciation at chemical equilibrium using the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM), which is based on chemical equilibrium. Because natural waters are dynamic systems which are never at chemical equilibrium, the current chemical-equilibrium-based approach gives wrong estimates of free metal ion concentrations (which are widely correlated with ecotoxicity) in natural waters. The kinetics-based approach will provide the actual metal speciation instead of the current practice of chemical equilibrium speciation. The better health of aquatic biota as a result of this 'new approach'will promote the acceptance of the approach by regulatory agencies.

"    )	Egr-1 overexpressing cardiac cells have repressed calcium dynamics linked to reduced calsequestrin 2 (CSQ2) expression (Kasneci et al App 1). We found Egr-1 to repress CSQ2 expression by a novel mechanism. Egr-1 binds rat and mouse CSQ2 promoter DNA at a 165 bp region that is >75% homologous between the 2 species and contains Egr-1 and SP1 consensus sites overlapping a CpG island. Egr-1 is known to bind to SP1, p300/CBP and casein kinase II, is phosphorylated by PKA, PKC and CKII and acetylated by p300/CBP. Whether these modifications or interactions promote activation or repression depends upon the promoter analyzed and tissue/cell type used. We hypothesize that Egr-1 displaces activating SP1 to repress CSQ2. Because Egr-1's action is context dependent we hypothesize that the Egr-1 modifications and the Egr-1 complexes formed with existing protein:DNA complexes and/or DNA/chromatin modifiers at the repressed CSQ2 promoter are particular to cardiac cells.

    )	In this proposal we will modulate Egr-1 and SP1 levels, define their interacting domains, define how they interact at CSQ2 promoter DNA, alter Egr-1 phosphorylation and acetylation and DNA methylation of CSQ2 DNA and measure the impact on CSQ2 expression and Egr-1:DNA binding. We will use biotinylated oligonucleotide and TAP-tag capture techniques to isolate new cardiac-specific Egr-1 binding partners and use proteomics to identify them. Validation of interactions will use biochemical and live cell techniques. 

    )	How transcription factors in general and Egr-1 in particular repress gene expression is not well understood. Egr-1 networking with other transcription factors and DNA modifying proteins at the DNA interface represses CSQ2 by a novel mechanism. In this proposal we will identify the repression mechanism of a protein of widespread importance (Egr-1) to a target of physiological relevance (CSQ2).

"It is estimated that faulty software costs the world economy 160 billion dollars yearly. Hence, efforts that can be made to help improve software reliability, even in a small way, will be worthwhile. Sir Tony Hoare and other eminent researchers recently determined that the ""time was right"" to revive Robert Floyd's 1967 Verifying Compiler (VC) project. They did so by recasting the project in the form of a Grand Challenge for Computer Science and Software Engineering known as Grand Challenge 6 (GC6), Dependable Systems Evolution. In summary, the GC6 is an international effort with a time scale of 15-20 years whose main deliverables consist of: (i) Unified theory of software analysis and construction; (ii) Verifying Compiler (VC), a tool that can establish the correctness of a program, relative to its specification, before it is run; (iii) Verified Software Repository (VSR) of industrial grade applications and their specifications. The overall research goal behind this proposal is to contribute to the development of theories, languages, tools and methodologies which can help the software industry be more effective at developing quality software. Work towards this goal will be through contributions to the GC6 with a focus on the Java Modeling Language (JML), a Behavioral Interface Specification Language (BISL) for Java because of Java's use in security and safety critical areas such as Web-based Enterprise Applications (WEAs) and embedded devices and controllers (such as smart cards). Specific projects within the scope of this proposal include: (1) compounding the benefits of Runtime Assertion Checking, Extended Static Checking, Full Static Program Verification and Model Checking; (2) unification of JML axiomatizations, mutliprover support, parallel verification; (3) enhancements to the language design and semantic foundation of JML; (4) industrial case studies. The combined advances set forth in the proposal are novel. They will help raise the bar on the size of applications that can be subject to formal verification using JML tools.",Logiciel,"Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Computing and Information Sciences - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Part of the widespread interest in nanometer-sized and mesoscopic systems is motivated by their capability to combine and hybridize mechanical and electronic properties of materials at the nanoscale. The long term goals of our research are to understand at a fundamental level, and harness into applications, (i) the interplays of structure and electronic degrees of freedom, and (ii) correlated electronic phases, in nano and mesoscopic systems. Our efforts to explore nanoscale mechanics and electronics will include systems such as graphene, metallic and semiconducting nanocrystals, carbon nanotubes, and organic-inorganic self-assembled materials. We will make use of specialized experimental methods, such as gated-mechanical breakjunctions and advanced scanning probes, which can simultaneously probe the structure and electronics of nanosystems. Initially, we will study electronic transport in mechanically strained graphene (graphite monolayer) transistors, and graphene/insulator/graphene (GIG) bilayers. A broad range of physics and applications will be explored in these graphene systems:

(2) tunable ultra-high frequency nano-oscillators,

"New and challenging radio paradigms, such as open access, cognitive and cooperative radios, are now emerging that will allow much more efficient spectrum utilization in future broadband wireless networks. The practical implementation of these concepts calls for improved wireless technologies to support flexible multi-user communications over a wide range of radio environments, and especially advanced cooperative multi-antenna strategies for the relaying of user signals. This proposal aims to study new adaptive space-time signal processing and transmission techniques, suitable for high-rate multi-user communications in cooperative multi-input multi-output (MIMO) relay networks. 

In the area of transmission, our efforts will focus on the study of new low-complexity, multi-user MIMO precoding techniques, including pre-cancellation, distributed scheduling and joint transmitter-receiver processing to enhance system throughput. We will also consider diversity-precoding combining schemes, with emphasis on non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward operation. In signal processing, we will investigate improved methods for the design of the cooperative relay beamformers, needed to spatially redirect the broadband user signals to their target destination under various fidelity constraints and practical limitations in the cooperative scheme. We will also investigate novel multi-carrier modulation techniques for MIMO relay channels. 

Our sponsor, InterDigital Canada, produces and licenses advanced digital wireless technologies for voice and data communications. Under our current agreement, it will have first access to the new techniques/algorithms developed under this proposal. In turns, McGill researchers will benefit from the broad expertise of InterDigital in wireless communications and from its participation in standardization committees. The proposed research is intended to give InterDigital a competitive edge in the emerging area of cooperative MIMO relay networks and allow the Canadian wireless industry to benefit from the new markets associated to these exacting technologies. Many graduate students will receive leading-edge training under this proposal.

"Emerging wireless broadband technologies promise to deliver high-speed data to multitudes of people in various geographical areas. This formidable revolution in wireless technology is due in a large part to the discoveries of ever more powerful techniques and algorithms for the processing of information signals.

Funding is requested to support a program of fundamental and applied research in the field of digital signal processing for broadband wireless communications. Two specific research areas are targeted: 

(1) Channel parameter estimation in broadband multiple antenna systems and 

(2) Speech signal enhancement based on auditory modeling.

The main objective of the work on channel estimation is to investigate new subspace-based algorithms for the blind estimation of unknown channel responses in multiple antenna broadband wireless systems, including so-called multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The research will focus on the development of new estimation techniques, their theoretical performance analysis and their efficient adaptive implementation for use in dynamic radio environments.

The proposed research on speech enhancement aims to improve the performance of current algorithms, in terms of speech quality and intelligibility, by exploiting relevant signal processing functions performed by the human auditory system. The targeted application will be that of voice communications in fixed and mobile wireless systems. New techniques for speech/noise classification will also be studied.

The new channel estimation algorithms are needed in the application of advanced coding and detection techniques to multiple antenna wireless systems to achieve the high data rates promised by these technologies. The new speech enhancement algorithms will aim to provide high-quality voice communications under a variety of noise and interference conditions, making it easier to engage in a phone conversation over wireless in public places or noisy transportation systems.

"This proposal requests an automated quaternary High Performance Liquid Chromatrography (HPLC) system with UV/Vis (Ultraviolet/Visible) and ELS (electron light scattering) dectectors, which is essential and urgently needed to support the innovative research programs of three investigators. The research projects of these investigators have as a common theme in the production of building block chemicals from biosourced materials. Specifically, these include the (i) characterization of biomass conversion products and intermediates used in the production of building block monomers and polymers; (ii) evaluation of biomass feedstocks in the recovery of reducing sugars; and (iii) characterization of simple organic products and intermediates in microbiological conversion application. Critical to the success of our programs is the ability to accurately and quickly characterize the products, intermediates and metabolites of various biomass treatment applications. HPLC is the most important analytical tool available in obtaining this information. Due to the nature and frequency of sampling associated with the research conducted by the co-applicants, a large number of samples requiring HPLC analysis are generated. However, we do not have access to equipment that will meet our current and future needs, which imposes a serious limitation to the progress of our research activities as rapid analyses of results are needed to assess performance and to modify the subsequent experimental phases. Hence, this can impact the overall quality of the work accomplished in these innovative research projects. We anticipate that 10-15 Highly Qualified Personnel per annum will benefit from the use of the requested HPLC instrumentation based on our current research activities.

"The aim of our work is to develop an innovative technology which optimizes municipal anaerobic digestion (AD) to effectively utilize a range of waste biomass substrates as co-digestates to generate biogas for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) in an integrated AD-SOFC system. This project will present a significant opportunity to showcase a highly efficient heat and power cogeneration system that utilizes a greenhouse gas neutral, renewable biofuel. Low-cost on-site cogeneration of electrical power and heat could significantly reduce the cost of wastewater treatment operations, particularly in smaller communities. Although the technical concept has been proven to be feasible with other types of fuel cells, the cost and complexity of these systems has been shown to be prohibitive. The use of the high temperature heat of the fuel cell to drive the chemical

reactions that convert the biogas to hydrogen, makes SOFC systems much simpler and less expensive. To apply integrated AD-SOFC systems on a larger scale, a number of technical and operational challenges need to be addressed. One of the key objectives of our work will address the effects of an AD-derived biogas, which has some degree of variability in its composition, on fuel cell performance and investigate AD process optimization via waste biomass pre-treatment and/or co-digestion to minimize this variability. This work will be coupled with the development of fuel conditioning strategies and flexible fuel cell control methodologies which will be adapted for this biogas fuel. At least 11 graduate (5) and undergraduate (6) HQP will be mentored during this project. This research will provide a range of benefits to Canada: including promoting the development of the renewable energy sector; reducing existing grid demands for electricity through on-site waste biomass-to-energy production; reducing greenhouse gas emissions; improving air quality through distributed clean energy production and improving water quality by improving sludge handling economics for smaller municipalities. The development of innovative solutions to these challenges has significant economic potential for Canadian developers of fuel cell power systems and suppliers of biogas-fuelled fuel cell components.","Autres ressources d'�nergie","Ressources d'�nergie","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario
"Well-developed passive and natural attenuation leachate management alternatives require comprehensive and integrated approaches to ensure sustained leachate mitigation. This project aims to develop, test and demonstrate, on a pilot-scale, a state-of-the-art integrated hybrid passive treatment technology that will allow for the controlled release and treatment of municipal landfill leachate through a waste heat temperature- regulated hybrid passive treatment system and subsequent natural attenuation zone, and contribute to the enhancement of a newly established fish habitat in a naturally depleted receiving environment. Specific research objectives include: (i) design, construction and long-term monitoring of a state-of-the-art pilot-scale waste-heat temperature-regulated integrated hybrid passive system treating leachate at the Merrick Landfill under temperate climatic conditions; (ii) toxicity assessment of leachate treated through the pilot-scale hybrid passive system and determination of potential impact of release on surface receivers; and, (iii) characterization of leachate, groundwater and surface water interactions through a comprehensive hydrogeochemical study and determination of leachate plume dispersion potential for the controlled release of treated leachate targeting discharge characteristics to enhance receivers. This research involves partnerships with the City of North Bay, AQUA Treatment Technologies and Conestoga-Rovers & Associates. The City of North Bay will become a demonstration facility for other Canadian municipalities and project findings will allow our supporting organizations to directly apply elements of this cost-effective integrated hybrid passive treatment approach to other municipal and industrial landfill leachate applications. At least 3 graduate and 3 undergraduate students will be trained, providing an expertise that will benefit research and technical development in the environmental sustainability sector. The development and demonstration of cost-effective naturalized innovative solutions for leachate treatment has significant economic potential for smaller Canadian municipalities, Canadian environmental consulting engineers and managers of landfill leachate systems.

"Usually, the manufacturing of heavy parts with large thicknesses relies on the casting process. Because of the uniqueness and the dimensions of these parts, this process requires generally a large amount of time for preparing the dies and setting the filling arrangement to avoid as much as possible flaws through the thickness. Obviously, that kind of part is costly to produce. The purpose of this project is to develop an in depth expertise in a very promising process for manufacturing heavy hollow axisymmetric parts made in high strength steel. This process is the roll bending process. The major goals are to reduce the time and the cost of the manufacturing of large axisymmetric parts, without loosing accuracy and service life duration. 

The main objective is to build an efficient and reliable tool (finite element program) for the numerical simulation of the process. The finite element analysis involves numerous parameters, transient thermal analysis, dynamic analysis, and the three nonlinear behaviors in structural analysis: large displacement, inelastic strain (plasticity) and contact. The methodology is as follow: 1) In depth roll bending process literature review; 2) Classification of parameters (geometry, material properties, tooling ...); 3) Studying heating strategy (hot part cooling during the process or on site heating ramp); 4) Studying rolls configuration and paths; 5) Create a parametric model; 6) Run a sequential transient thermal analysis and dynamic structural non-linear analysis; 7) Evaluation of the residual stress distribution; 8) Comparison of the final shape with the requested design; 9) Validation of the numerical results with experiments; 10) Sensitivity analysis in order to minimize production time and cost.

There is a need for a well documented analysis for forming heavy axisymmetric part from thick plates in high strength steel. Among several kinds of parts like tanks and pressure vessels that can be manufactured with the roll bending process, one direct industrial application of this research upon this process is the manufacturing of the crown of large Francis turbine.

"We will be researching techniques developed for the analysis of nonlinear and chaotic systems and applying them to biological signals. In particular, we are interested in developing a robust system that is capable of monitoring muscular fatigue in a noninvasive manner. The current ""gold standard"" examines the spectrum of the myoelectric signals (electrical signals associated with muscle contractions), tracking the median frequency. As a muscle fatigues, the spectrum will shift towards lower frequencies, resulting in a decreased median frequency; however, the median frequency will also change when the force of the contraction and/or the joint angle is altered, which confounds this method and limits its practical utility. We are developing a novel method based on a Generalized Random Scaling Fractal model of the myoelectric signal spectrum. Initial results already indicate that this methodology can separate the different effects of contractile force, joint angle, and muscular fatigue. This will enable to construction of a system that is capable of monitoring muscular fatigue, not only for static contractions, but also for dynamic contractions. Research into reliable noninvasive methods for monitoring muscle fatigue has implications in application areas such as ergonomics, injury prevention, sports medicine, and human performance. These analysis methods also have utility in muscle activity onset detection. The onset time of muscle activity is a fundamental characteristic used in biomechanics and motor control research; however, analysis of the myoelectric signal for onset detection is often conducted manually, or if an automated system is used, manual correction is often still required. The problem is that either noise is falsely labeled as myoelectric data, or low levels of contractions are missed. This research will be leveraging the fact that myoelectric signals exhibits different parameters associated with its fractal geometry and persistence, as compared to its background noise. The ability to discern myoelectric signals from the noise will improve the accuracy and robustness of automatic onset detection. This will save time for researchers and clinicians, but also assist in the development of other real-time myoelectric signal analysis systems.","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Commun.,Computers & Components",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Maintaining blood sugar levels within normal limits is essential to an animal's well-being because the brain needs a constant supply of sugar. The main blood sugar, glucose, stimulates insulin secretion, which then leads to uptake and metabolism of glucose by tissues such as muscle, liver and fat. When insulin binds to muscle or liver cells, it initiates a cascade of enzymatic reactions that eventually lead to increased glucose metabolism. The factors that regulate this cascade is not completely known. One theory is that the cell's ability to make energy (called ATP) changes under certain nutritional conditions, and that low cellular ATP impairs the ability of the cells to take up and use glucose. In this project, we will investigate the role of ATP in determining

glucose uptake and metabolism in muscle and liver. We will then compare the effects of various nutritional states on an animal's ability to maintain blood sugar levels and correlate this with cellular ATP and other biochemical markers.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Integrative Animal Biology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"Summary of proposed research for public release: 

The proposed research is focused on the development of computer modeling capabilities in analyzing soil deformation and soil movement.  Ground movement and soil mobility are important subjects in geotechnical engineering.  Small and large movements are of interest, and sometimes crucial, for many engineering projects.  Large movement and fast mobility of soil, such as landslide and debris flow, threaten the safety of people and cause damage to properties.  Landslide and debris flow can lead to significant property damage and loss of life.  As a result, a quantitative risk analysis (QRA) has been adopted to determine the potential threats due to landslide and debris flow.  In order to apply QRA effectively, it is necessary to analyze soil movement and soil mobility with reasonable accuracy and  reliability.

Beside managing natural hazards, ground movement calculation is of interest to the a) mining industry, in ensuring the safety of mine, handling of materials, b) the extraction industry, such as oil and gas, in stability of well bores and c) anyone who uses the ground to support a structure or is carrying out work that changes the ground conditions.

This research is to develop and make improvements in existing constitutive models for analyzing soil deformation and soil mobility, and to develop numerical techniques for analyzing the mobility of soils.  The numerical model will be able to simulate movement of soils and calculate the velocity, distance and quantity of flow.  The model is based on a combined continuum and discontinuum approach which will enable us to use continuum models for arriving at the constitutive description of soils and for calculation of large soil movements.

"Accurate chromosome segregation is essential for the genomic stability of all eukaryotes. The mitotic checkpoint is a failsafe mechanism that ensures accurate chromosome segregation. The kinetochore (kT) is the structural platform where mitotic checkpoint proteins dock and therefore, is the foundation of where mitotic checkpoint regulation occurs. Mis12 (minichromosome instability) is one of the key centromere proteins that specify kT and mitotic checkpoint protein assembly. The centromere protein Mis12 exists as a protein complex and specifies a CENP-A independent centromere assembly pathway. We hypothesize that the Mis12 complex is important for centromere structural integrity as well as mitotic checkpoint signaling. To understand the mechanism of Mis12 function, we propose to study the structure and function of Mis12. We will map the centromere localization domain of hMis12 by screening a random linker scanning as well as deletion and truncation mutant collection of hMis12. To understand the interaction between subunits in the Mis12 complex, we will screen the hMis12 mutant collection for protein-protein interaction domain(s), by yeast 2-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer technique will be used to analysis protein interactions amongst the Mis12 complex in situ. The regulation of cell-cycle specific centromere dynamics of hMis12 and the hMis12 complex will be analyzed by the Fluorescent Recovery After Photobleaching technique. Mis12 mutants that are defective in specific protein-protein interaction will be analyzed for the functional consequence in vivo (effects on the mitotic checkpoint, the stability of kinetochore-MT interaction, and assembly of the kinetochore structure).","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"As sea otters return to the West Coast of Vancouver Island, they make human enemies by eating hordes of shellfish, which are mainstays of coastal communities. But otters also boost tourism and trigger 'trophic cascades' when the decimation of shellfish enables the recovery of shellfish 'prey'-productive, habitat-forming kelp forests-and many other species dependent on kelp. What is appropriate human intervention? Should coastal communities hunt otters to protect the valuable shellfish industry? Should they invest heavily in the expansion of other industries, such as marine mammal tourism? To answer these questions, we must understand the full suite of benefits and costs.  Globally, countless communities and nations struggle with the same decision-making quandaries: countless possible policies govern many human impacts on myriad ecosystem components, affecting diverse competing values. Such quandaries call for an integrated understanding of ecological dynamics, human impacts, and the benefits that people derive from interactions with ecosystems (ecosystem services).

In this project, professors, students, and postdoctoral fellows will collaborate closely with management boards and government agencies to (i) assess the many ecological changes associated with otters and kelp forests, including 'nutrient subsidies' from kelp forests to adjacent and distant ecosystems; (ii) represent these changes in a spatial model that depicts the effects of various human interventions on ecosystems; and (iii) evaluate the monetary and non-monetary values associated with changes in ecosystem services like the provision of various subsistence, recreational, and commercial fisheries.  Our project will enhance human well-being, environmental health, and sustainability by enabling management and policies that better account for both direct and indirect effects of sea otters and kelp, and for the full set of values affected. By uniting research in the natural and social sciences with policymaking, our project will serve as a model for sustainable environmental decision-making in Canada and elsewhere.","Oc�ans et eaux int�rieures","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"When an individual species becomes much more abundant than it used to be or than other similar species, it can have serious detrimental effects on ecosystems and human economies. Such superabundance can result from a species being newly introduced to an ecosystem (e.g., the zebra mussels in the Great Lakes) or from important changes to an ecosystem or the abiotic environment (e.g., the mountain pine beetle in western North America, a native species that has become superabundant as a result of a combination of warmer winters, even-aged stands of trees, and other factors). These native and non-native superabundant species are especially problematic in economies that depend upon natural resources, like British Columbia. For example, non-native species cost Canada ~$187 million each year in direct impacts on agriculture, fisheries, and forestry, and $13.3 - $34.5 billion in indirect costs (e.g., reduced yield of natural resources). And when pathogens like Lyme disease-causing Borrelia burgdorferi become superabundant-often because of the superabundance of host species, such as deer mice-they can cause many people to become sick. Yet we have a very limited understanding of the general causes of superabundance, in part because we lack good information regarding the patterns of abundance for species across time and space.



The goal of the proposed research is to increase our understanding of the causes of this superabundance by assembling spatial and temporal abundance data, developing ecological/evolutionary models to generate testable hypotheses, and testing these hypotheses with these data. Such an enhanced understanding of superabundance will allow us to reduce the risks and damages of biological invasions, infestations, and pathogens by enabling new management techniques and preventative measures.",Environnement,Environnement,"Evolution & Ecology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"The over arching goal of our research program is to develop early warning markers for measuring adverse

effects of environmental contaminants on ecosystem health. Environmental exposure just above background

levels rarely leads to observable immediate effects. Slow, insidious changes in biological functions, reflecting

diminished wellbeing, are more common. We have spent the last five years developing, evaluating and

validating the use of a number of neurochemical parameters involved in the dopaminergic and muscarinic

cholinergic nervous systems as biomarkers for the neurotoxicity of methylmercury (MeHg) and other

environmental chemicals. We now have a series of neurochemical and neurofunctional tests for wildlife and

human population studies. The objectives of the next five year program are to understand the underlying

molecular mechanisms and to evaluate the physiological and ecological consequences of these effects.

Our approach of studying the same endpoints in keystone mammalian species (including human) is novel and

relevant. We also have the capacity to use the findings from cutting-edge basic experiments for applied

wildlife and epidemiological studies. Our results may be used to establish thresholds for ecosystem health

"In this proposal, it is suggested that soluble ionic liquids can be used as supports for catalyst/reagent immobilization and synthesis in homogeneous solution phase.  Because of the wide range of ionic liquid supports available, their use as supports is likely to be compatible with most common synthetic chemistries.  The solubility properties of these ionic liquid supports can be tuned by the variation of cations and anions to make them phase separate from less polar organic solvents and aqueous media.  The ionic liquid-supported species can therefore be purified from the reaction mixture by simple washings.   Ionic liquid-supported catalysts and reagents will be prepared and used and reused.  Parallel and combinatorial libraries of small molecules have been synthesized.  Ionic liquid-supported synthesis (ILSS) will applied to the preparation of peptides, oligosaccharides and oligonucleotides.  The comparison of ILSS with solid-phase synthesis, soluble-polymer supported synthesis and fluorous phase synthesis will be highlighted where applicable.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Inorganic & Organic Chemistry",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Chan Lab at the University of Toronto is focused on the development and translation of nanotechnology for biological and medical applications.  In comparison to many research fields, nanotechnology is relatively young and many basic principles of nanotechnology research is under heavy investigation, such as the understanding of how the biophysicochemical properties (e.g., size, shape, and surface chemistries) of nanoparticles relate to biological response. As the field continues to expand, novel tools to quantify nanoparticle concentration of different surface chemistries is needed. Currently, many studies on the nano-bio interface are qualitative.  This research proposal is a continuation of the Discovery grant applied in 2006, which focuses on the use of phage-display screening to identify targeting agents to nanoparticles of different surface chemistries and use either the target agent or the phage in a biological assay to measure unknown concentrations of nanoparticles of different surface chemistries in various biological environment.  In this proposed project, we will continue to identify and validate the target agents for metallic nanoparticle.  Furthermore, we will analyze their use in immunoassay-type experiments.  Finally we will develop a portable dipstick version of the assay.

"Every year, nearly 100,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur in North America. These knee injuries cost more than 1 billion dollars to treat. The mechanisms of ACL injury are not well understood and, as a result, it has not been possible to devise injury prevention measures that are effective. Imbalanced muscle activity is believed to cause ACL injury during dynamic activities. However,  direct evidence for this hypothesis is lacking since relevant experiments cannot be performed on live subjects.       

     I am currently building a $200,000 test frame (funded by CFI) that will make it possible to apply realistic loads to instrumented cadaveric knees so that this important hypothesis can finally be tested. The experimental system uses servoelectric actuators to simulate ground reaction forces (GRF) and the forces generated by the seven primary muscle groups that traverse the hip and knee during dynamic high-risk activities.

     A computer model of the knee will be used to find the muscle force and muscle firing pattern needed to mimic the in-vivo knee kinematics during high-risk activities. This muscle force and firing pattern will be applied on the cadaver knee by the test system.  The muscle activity on the cadaver knee will be sequentially and progressively perturbed (until the ACL tears) with the ACL strain being continuously measured.

     The study will make it possible, for the first time, to demonstrate in detail how ACL strains are related to muscle activity in dynamic situations. In this way it will reveal specific injury mechanisms. This knowledge will provide a framework from which injury prevention strategies can be devised. For example, it may indicate that injuries can be reduced if specific muscle groups are strengthened or if neuromuscular training programs are tuned in a certain way. It may also allow individual athlete risk to be assessed and may finally explain why for a given sport, women athletes tend to sustain more ACL injuries than men do.  In the longer term, this research is expected to lead to a reduction in ACL injury related health care costs. It will also provide multidisciplinary training for students and will provide Canada with important new biomechanics knowledge.

"With the rapidly accumulating sequence data in the genomic databases, new bioinformatic approaches and efficient experimental methods are needed to decipher the information contained in this wealth of sequence data.  Molecular evolutionary approaches offer the perspective of understanding the diversity of protein function from the historical forces that shaped its evolution. This research seeks to understand the mechanisms of visual pigment function using a variety of innovative comparative approaches such as the experimental resurrection of ancestral proteins, and investigations of present day animals with unusual visual adaptations.  Ancestral visual pigment studies will be combined with studies of the visual pigments found in the all-cone retina of the garter snake.  Molecular mechanisms underlying the unusual vision of garter snakes will be investigated by characterizing the visual pigments contained in their photoreceptors.  Our innovative approach combining studies of both resurrected and present day visual pigments promises to yield insights into visual pigment function not easily attainable by more conventional methods.  Ultimately, better understanding of visual pigment structure and function will have important implications not only for the treatment of eye diseases, but also for the pharmaceutical industry, and the development of drugs which target G protein coupled receptors, of which visual pigments are one of the best studied members.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"There is no doubt that progress in the semiconductor electronics has impacted immensely on our standard of living in the past 30 years. This rapid growth has been driven by scaling a variety of electronic devices. However, it was recently predicted that traditional semiconductor electronics will face fundamental limitations in near future. When the device scaling goes below around 10 nm (65 nm at present), a reliable information processing is known to be impossible due to the quantum behavior of electrons. To overcome this problem and attain further progress, spin-electronics (or spintronics) utilizing both spin-dependent and charge-dependent electric currents has been intensively exploited as a promising alternative to the semiconductor technology relying only on the binary states of electric current (bit of 1 or 0). I am proposing this research program to produce new ferromagnetic semiconductors which is a key element in spin-electronics. The spin is an intrinsic property of electrons which can be manifested as two distinguishable magnetic-energy states (spin-up and spin-down). The conventional semiconductor-based electronics have utilized only the charge degree of freedom (positive holes and negative electrons) without considering the spin properties of charge carriers because ferromagnetism is absent in currently available semiconducting materials. Therefore spintronics technology requires new semiconductors which show ferromagnetic behavior and thus allow a current of spin-polarized electrons to be generated and controlled, and preserve the spin-coherence over long time and distance in an existing semiconductor structure. The incorporation of magnetism into organic-and inorganic-based semiconducting materials will be attempted using the magnetic-impurity doping method. This work on ferromagnetic semiconductors and their abilities to transport the spin-polarized electrons will facilitate the realization of future spintronic devices, including spin-transistors, magnetic memory, logic-circuits working both in magnetic and electric fields.","Sciences physiques","Avancement des connaissances","Condensed Matter Physics",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan

"The objective of the present project is to investigate electromagnetic-hydrodynamics phenomena of atmospheric plasmas and electrohydraulic discharge in gas, liquid and solid multi-phase systems.  Atmospheric pressure thermal (APTP) and non-thermal plasmas (APNTP) were used for gaseous pollution control of acid gases (NOx, SOx, HF, HCI, etc.), greenhouse gases (PFC, HC, HxOy, etc.), toxic gases (NF3, volatile organic compounds).  ozone-depleting gases (CFCs, halon), etc., and the most recently for solid, liquid and gaseous fuel reforming in energy industries.  Electrohydraulic discharge ED, i.e., discharge inside water or liquids, were used for drinking and waste water treatments using their oxidation and reduction processes as well as excellent in activation capability.  However, the role play by the electromagnetic hydrodynamics EMHD is not well understood as well as their the other physical and chemical detail processes in multi-phase systems, hence the optimization of the industrial processes applied these APTP, APNTP and ED are not well achieved.



The program proposed here is an expansion of many recent phenomena observed in atmospheric pressure thermal and non-thermal plasmas in a multi-phase system.  Based on advanced PIV imaging, EMHD shows surprised phenomena in gas and liquid single phase flow such as EMHD generated wake, von Karman type voltex, on-set of turbulence etc. under the very low Reynolds number.  The physical mechanism of these phenomena, as well as pressure drop reduction, pumping effect, drag reduction, flow regime transition are the forces of the present study.  For a multi-phase system, EMHD void and solid migration, shockwave/pressure wave generation and propagation, cavitation, thermophresis etc. will be an additional phenomena to be investigated.

"There is a growing interest in adding distributed generators (DGs) that are driven by renewable energy resources such as wind and solar energy to the electric power systems (EPS).  However, adding a large numbers of DGs to the EPS may compromise the stability and reliability of the EPS.  DGs operating as islands are not permitted by utilities as a result of risks to safety and equipment.  Anti-islanding is a critically important component of the interconnection system between a DG and the EPS, and is also a challenging technical problem that has been recognized as one of the technical barriers preventing widespread deployment of DGs.

       Although numerous anti-islanding methods have been investigated, a universal anti-islanding method that possesses adequate robustness and reliability is yet to be developed.  The objective of the proposed research is to develop a methodology that allows the best attributes of existing schemes as well as new schemes to be seamlessly incorporated into an innovative classification model that identifies whether an island condition exists or not.  The proposed technique will be universal and hence, applicable for DGs that interface directly to the EPS through rotary generators and also for DGs that interface to the EPS through power electronic converters.  The success of this project will enable higher penetration of renewable energy in electricity markets and facilitate greenhouse gas reduction and economic development.

       The research will proceed along a timeline with well defined tasks that include: developing a simulation model, developing a database of training events, developing and validating a classification model, performing a comparative analysis with other approaches, constructing an interconnection apparatus and conducting field verification tests.  The interconnection apparatus will be tested on both a photovoltaic DG installation (power converter based) and a wind turbine DG installation (induction generator based) that reside in our research facilities.  This project will provide research and laboratory based training for two Ph.D. students and one M.Sc.E. student with skills that are in high demand by Canadian industry.

"We have a poor understanding of the interactive effects of nutrient availability, water supply, and understory competition on stand productivity in boreal forests where competitive understory species such as Canada bluejoint grass are abundant and grow vigorously and where N is often the most limiting nutrient. In this study, I will use both field- and greenhouse-based approaches to study soil N dynamics, competition between understory and tree species, and how they are affected by resource (N and water) additions. The objectives are: 1) to investigate how understory vegetation and water availability interact to affect soil nutrient dynamics and tree nutrition; 2) to explore the linkage between soil resource availability (or competition) and tree ecophysiological processes (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, stable C isotope fractionation, and plant N uptake); 3) to study the effects of competition and resource availability on the function and diversity of soil microbial populations; and 4) to gain a better understanding of the role of organic N in Canada bulejoint grass and white spruce nutrition. I will study net and gross rates of N mineralization, net and gross rates of nitrification, rate of heterotrophic nitrification, rates of soluble organic N production, N immobilization by microbes, N uptake by both tree and understory species, and the net primary productivity of the forest ecosystem. The stable N and C isotope (15N and 13C) techniques, ecophysiological (e.g., gas exchange) measurements, and vector analysis will be used to investigate the mechanisms for N competition and resource limitations. A greenhouse experiment will be conducted to test the hypothesis that Canada bluejoint grass can take up simple organic forms of N. Results from this study will help us better understand the factors controlling forest productivity in sites infested with competitive understory vegetation, design forest management strategies to adopt to the changing precipitation patterns, and provide information on the upper limits of forest productivity in the boreal region. The proposed research will advance ecological theories in soil-plant relations, resource limitation, competition, and boreal vegetation dynamics.","Foresterie (sylviculture, am�nagement forestier)","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","Environmental Earth Sciences",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"Numerical linear algebra is at the core of most scientific computing. Many scientific, engineering, and other problems are most effectively represented and then solved on computers, as matrix problems, or linear algebra problems. One of the important applied areas of numerical linear algebra is estimation. This research aims to develop numerically reliable and efficient algorithms and software for solving general and specific estimation problems which may arise in practical areas such as communications, signal processing, global navigation satellite systems, and statistics etc. These problems can be either small scale or large scale. This research also carries out the analyses of  the algorithms to show their reliability and sensitivity analyses of the problems to show what effects changes in data caused by finite precision computation or uncertainty in the data will have on the final results. 



The outcome of this research will be valuable not only to the study of scientific computing but also to industry, particularly to the communications technology companies and GNSS receiver manufactures.

"Reading is a remarkable human achievement.  Yet, despite our dependency on written communication many people in Canada are functionally illiterate.  It is widely believed that a better understanding of how experts read (in the present case how they generate the pronunciation of a word from print) will help us understand and remediate reading problems.



Figuring out how to pronounce a word can be an elaborate and effortful process for novice readers.  In contrast, figuring out how to pronounce a word seldom requires any thought or effort for expert readers.  Although experts are largely unaware of how they generate a pronunciation to printed words, the time taken to read a word aloud often depends on the context in which it is being read.  It is therefore possible that how an expert reader computes the pronunciation of a written word depends on the context in which the word appears. The present research examines this possibility. 



Presently, the received view is that expert readers cannot change how they generate a word's pronunciation.  Indeed, the goal of reading instruction is often about getting to the point where this does not need to happen.  So, if it were established that central feature of expert reading is the ability to effortlessly change how a pronunciation is generated from print, then this would lead to a dramatic reconceptualization of what it means to be an expert reader and how novice readers should be instructed.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Lodgepole pine is a widely distributed species known to grow under a variety of soil conditions. Its ability to grow on nutrient-poor, coarse-textured soils is unique for a species not known to fix nitrogen, and poses interesting questions regarding its nitrogen source in such environments. It is clear that we don't fully understand how pine satisfies its nitrogen requirement. 

      Mineralization of organic nitrogen by free-living soil microorganisms has traditionally been viewed as the primary process by which plant-usable nitrogen is released in soil, and hence, as the step which limits nitrogen accretion in forest ecosystems. In addition, certain mycorrhizal fungi possess enzymes that allow direct access to nitrogen bound in forest floor organic matter, thereby ""short-circuiting"" the ""traditional"" nitrogen mineralization pathway. Such ""short-circuiting"" could be an important route of nitrogen transfer in some forest ecosystems rich in organic matter. However, such a view is too narrow to explain the nitrogen nutrition of species such as lodgepole pine in view of its ability to grow on nutrient poor, mineral soils with little or no accumulated organic nitrogen. 

      The obvious nitrogen pool for plants growing on nitrogen-poor substrates is the atmosphere. Indeed, nitrogen-fixing bacteria are known to associate with roots and mycorrhizae of conifers, and to fix nitrogen in the rhizosphere, but quantitative estimates suggest that rhizospheric fixation is not a principal nitrogen source for pine. I intend to compare nitrogen fixation by above ground stem endophytic bacteria with that associated with tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (TEM) using genetically marked bacteria strains, 15N assays, confocal scanning laser microscropy and transmission electron microscopy.

"My broad objectives are to  (a) understand the biogeographic history of insects at a time when continents were not in the positions they occupy now, and (b) to determine the evolutionary significance of morphological traits commonly used in defining their taxonomic categories.  Members of the grasshopper family Acrididae are notable for their widespread distributions and rich phenotypic diversities, and are therefore suitable for addressing those themes.  Earlier biogeographic studies lacked methodological rigour and were essentially ""narratives"", ad hoc interpretations of the distribution, relative abundance and morphology of present-day species.  Such accounts have, up to now, gone untested.  Since my last instalment, our molecular phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences have shed some light on the biogeographic origins of 3 subfamilies.  For instance, we show that the melanopline grasshoppers constitute one of a few examples of an early South to North America dispersal, a direction and timeframe that are contrary to what was previously thought.  Preliminary results suggest that another group, the gomphocerine grasshoppers, may also have originated in one of the southern continents, but at the moment we do not know which land mass.  To address the latter and other questions arising from recent work, I propose to expand our analyses in three ways.  First, for collaborative purposes, we will analyze nuclear DNA sequences.  Second, we will sample species from areas (e.g. Africa, South America, Southeast Asia) which heretofore, have been underrepresented in our studies but whose analysis will be critical to addressing unresolved questions of origin. Third, we intend to initiate similar studies of other subfamilies with intercontinental distributions to determine how general are our biogeographic findings. Ultimately, it is expected that this research will contribute to the growing body of empirical studies that seek to understand the early biogeographic history of insects.  Our phylogenies are also expected to provide templates for understanding the evolution of acoustic and visual displays and of genitalic characters, traits that undoubtedly have played a role in the diversification of these insects.

"Let K be a number field and let G_K be the absolute Galois group of K. In the case where one deals with one dimensional representations of G_K, Class field theory provides a correspondence between these L-functions and finite abelian extensions of K. The L-functions coming from one dimensional representations are called abelian L-functions. In some cases, these abelian L-functions vanish precisely with order one at s=0. The last assumption implies that K is either a totally real number field or an almost totally real field (ATR for short). In the early seventies, Harold Stark made deep conjectures which relate the first derivative of such L-functions at s=0 with units lying in abelian extensions of K. This conjecture is striking since it relates a special value of an L-function (analytic data) with a certain unit in an abelian extension of K (algebraic data). Harold Stark could prove this conjecture in the special case where K is the field of rational numbers or K is an imaginary quadratic number field. He could prove it by relating the first derivative of the L-function to a special value of a nice holomorphic function which satisfies many symmetries, a so-called modular function. The main goal of my research is to find the ""right mathematical object"" that should replace the role played by the modular functions in the general case where K is either a totally real field or an ATR field. So far, this mathematical object seems to be very elusive and it is expected that any progress made on this problem will bring together different areas like analysis, algebra and differential geometry.  All these mentioned themes appear in various guises in number theory and we, number theorists, would like to clarify their relationships in order to have a more unified understanding.

"This research program is centered on flatfishes (Order Pleuronectiformes: soles, halibut, flounder, plaice, turbot, etc.), a group of asymmetrical fishes that has fascinated the general public and scientists for ages because of their peculiar morphology, their continued importance in the commercial and recreational fisheries worldwide and because they are simply a delectable and very healthy food source.  Yet, for most of the 700+ species, basic knowledge about their diversity, general biology and evolution is lacking.  The objectives of this research program are to i) properly assess the diversity of flatfishes through proper taxonomic studies to allow the construction hypotheses of species interrelationships and ii) use these historical hypotheses in the assessment of the evolution of life history traits and distributional patterns of flatfishes. 

The first objective will be attained through a morphological and osteological study of specimens available in museum collections around the world. In the first step, we will assess the validity of nominal species and then proceed with a phylogenetic study of these species. This study will aim at defining groups that have a common ancestor on the basis of unique characteristics. Results will be expressed in the form of  branching trees of species or cladograms. 

Using the cladograms as an historical framework, we will then proceed with a study of the evolution of life history traits and biogeographical patterns. This historical perspective will provide fisheries biologists with a more precise view of the biology of traits that are important in their species and stock assessments (fecundity, age at maturity, maximum growth, etc.). In addition, the species cladograms will be useful to help understand the history of the geographical distribution and speciation patterns in the flatfish groups.

During the next five years, three widely distributed and commercially important groups of flatfishes will be the focus of our investigations; the Soleidae (European and Indo-Pacific soles), the Achiridae (American soles) and the Paralichthyidae (Sinistral flounders).

"A new memory requires the formation of a new memory trace, or ""engram"", in the brain. Memory traces are thought to consist of networks of simultaneously activated neurons, and a major mechanism through which new networks can be formed is through long-lasting increases (or decreases) in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. My research is aimed at understanding how new memory traces are formed through long-lasting changes in the strength of synaptic connections between brain cells. The parahippocampal cortex and neocortex are regions of the brain that are crucial for normal memory formation. The parahippocampal area is thought to combine different types of sensory input during memory encoding. Memory is then thought to be stored more permanently through connections with other parts of the brain including the neocortex. To better understand the fundamental mechanisms that mediate memory formation, I use various electrophysiological and pharmacological techniques to determine how synaptic strengths can be altered in the parahippocampal and neocortical regions of the rat brain. There are two primary lines of research. The first line of research is aimed at understanding how the entorhinal cortex (an important parahippocampal area) processes and encodes sensory input. Experiments examine how temporal patterns of activity increase or decrease synaptic strength, and how activity in the entorhinal cortex can be modulated by the parasubiculum and perirhinal cortex. These experiments are important because they can indicate how sensory information is processed by neural circuits during the encoding of a new memory. The second line of research is aimed at understanding changes that occur in the neocortex during memory storage. Experiments will focus on identifying elements of the neocortical circuit that are affected by a cellular model of learning, and characterizing the cortical EEG rhythms and morphological changes in neurons that can lead to long-lasting changes in synaptic strength. This line of research may help us understand how memories can be stored in the neocortex for long periods of time.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"My research program is now being severely limited by the need to quantify the nutritional value of a great many primate food items; the solution is to adopt a new technology for our field, namely a NIR Rapid Content Analyzer.  I seek to identify the factors that influence wildlife abundance as this information has become critical for conservation planning. One of the most important ecological factors in this process is the acquisition of adequate nutrition. Recently I have shown that to provide an accurate measurement of nutritional quality, a more extensive means of estimating nutritional composition is needed than has been used in the past. While it has been known for some time that the nutrients in plants within a single species can vary over different spatial and temporal scales, it is only recently that the magnitude of this variance has become recognized with respect to primate diets. Depending on location, young leaves of the same species eaten by colobus monkeys at our field site varied in protein content from 22- 47% and the fat content of a single species of ripe fruit varied seasonally from 0.3- 30%. This striking variation means that we can no longer use species-specific nutritional profiles to estimate food quality; consequently, traditional nutritional analyses are no longer suitable, as they are too time consuming, expensive, and international transport is prohibitive. Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a solution. The general principle of NIRS is that the chemical bonds in a food item are represented in a spectrum when the sample is irradiated with near infrared light. These spectra are then calibrated against reference values (determined through traditional nutritional analysis) to develop regression equations. Using NIRS, up to 150 plant samples per day can be analyzed for a suite of nutrients. This equipment will be taken to my CFI funded lab in Kibale National Park, Uganda where it will be used in the training of my students and post-docs and a number of researchers.","Conservation et pr�servation",Environnement,"Evolution and Ecology",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The ability to recognize objects that we touch is dependent on sensory feedback from both cutaneous

receptors, located in the skin, and also receptors located in deep tissues (muscle, joints, tendons).

Together these receptors encode information about the texture, shape, consistency and temperature of

objects that we touch. This information is encoded by specific peripheral receptors, sensitive to

mechanical and thermal stimuli, and the brain ultimately interprets these disparate sources of

information to construct an internal representation or image of the external world. For example, when

one explores a hand-held object (e.g. a pencil or paper clip), then one feels the object itself, and not

the details of the individual skin areas in contact with the object or the various postures adopted by the

fingers. My research focuses on the perceptual mechanisms that allow us to appreciate surface texture

and object shape using touch. Expt 1 will examine the dependence of tactile roughness on the

spacing and height of the individual tactile elements (raised dots, as used for Braille). These

experiments are designed to challenge the current thinking that a spatial variation code underlies tactile

roughness. Expt 2 will determine the extent to which haptic perception of shape (i.e. dependent on both

cutaneous and proprioceptive feedback) shows constancy as a function of the design of the task, the

orientation of the angles in space, and the range of angles tested. Expt 3 will study the influence of movement itself on the perception of tactile stimuli: movement speed will be

systematically varied to determine the extent to which this modulates perception, with the overall view

of determining how constancy is attained in the face of different exploratory movements, and so widely

varying sensory signals. Together, the results will provide a better understanding of the factors that

contribute to generating perceptual constancy in the somatosensory system. This is an important

concept, given that constancy has been observed in all major sensory systems.

"The organization of individual insects into cooperatively complex groups represents one of the major transitions of life on earth. However, it also comprises one of the greatest challenges for Darwin's theory of evolution. 

    My research program investigates the evolution of chemical detection of invaders and chemical communication (pheromones) within insect social colonies. The importance of chemical signaling to the release of social behaviour has been demonstrated in social insects, but its potential evolutionary role has not been shown. Here, I propose to investigate the role of pheromones in the evolutionary trajectory that has led to insect sociality and to address two major challenges facing evolutionary biology: why does social behaviour first evolve and, once it has evolved, how can it be elaborated into complex systems of organization? Most research on social insect communication has focused on these insect groups: the bees, ants, wasps and termites. The communication mechanisms in these groups likely evolved many tens of millions of years ago, so that early steps in the development of communication are likely to have been overwritten by evolutionary elaboration. To elucidate the role of communication in the evolution of sociality it is essential to target relatively recent evolutionary origins; such a worker caste has evolved relatively recently (approx. 6 million years ago) within the thrips insect group and the forms of communication in this suite of species likely reflect the very first steps in colonial organization. The focal organisms for this research will be the gall-inducing thrips and their specialist invaders on Acacia plants. Thrips provide an alternative model for understanding social evolution, and have already provided major and different insights to studies of the 'traditional' social groups. Chemical communication in social thrips colonies has not yet been considered due to the paucity of life-history details that have only recently been uncovered. This program will place Canada at the forefront of evolutionary and chemical ecology, as well as building on Canada's existing excellence in socio-biology.

Forty journal papers were published from 2002 to 2007. Two ASTM standards were proven to be based on wrong theories: one was not renewed; the other is presently being rewritten by the applicant at the request of ASTM. Two other standards will be modified soon to include (at ASTM's request) certain quality control methods developed by the applicant. This research work will be continued by investigating original paths that are presently theoretical in nature, but will rapidly have practical applications. The long term objective is to improve the reliability of methods to determine groundwater parameters. One PhD student (D1) will study pumping tests under the influence of other pumping wells, which complicates transient interpretation methods. Two master's students (M1, M2) will investigate the inverse problem of finding the best saturated-unsaturated hydraulic functions for pumping tests in unconfined and semi-confined aquifers. Another PhD student (D2) will continue to study how pore pressure waves propagate, with complex mathematical developments. One master's student (M3) will study permeability tests in monitoring wells spanning the water table. One master's student (M4) will examine how the lag time of a clay layer (whcih is influenced by upper and lower boundary conditions) may influence the local data of slug tests and pulse tests. One PhD student (D3) will develop new methods to define protection areas around wells in unconfined aquifers, with realistic conditions for net infiltration and regional gradients. One master's student (M5) will try to establish a realistic method to predict the capillary retention curve from physical properties such as gradation and porosity. One PhD student (D4) will develop an equivalent to the Kozeny-Carman equation but with due consideration to anisotropy and modifications of the internal structure due to compaction.  It is therefore proposed to train 9 students (4 PhDs and 5 masters) in groundwater engineering.

Two other standards will be modified soon to include (at ASTM's request) certain quality control methods developed by the applicant. This research work will be continued by investigating original paths that are presently theoretical in nature, but will rapidly have practical applications. The long term objective is to improve the reliability of methods to determine groundwater parameters. One PhD student (D1) will study pumping tests under the influence of other pumping wells, which complicates transient interpretation methods. Two master's students (M1, M2) will investigate the inverse problem of finding the best saturated-unsaturated hydraulic functions for pumping tests in unconfined and semi-confined aquifers. Another PhD student (D2) will continue to study how pore pressure waves propagate, with complex mathematical developments. One master's student (M3) will study permeability tests in monitoring wells spanning the water table. One master's student (M4) will examine how the lag time of a clay layer (whcih is influenced by upper and lower boundary conditions) may influence the local data of slug tests and pulse tests. One PhD student (D3) will develop new methods to define protection areas around wells in unconfined aquifers, with realistic conditions for net infiltration and regional gradients. One master's student (M5) will try to establish a realistic method to predict the capillary retention curve from physical properties such as gradation and porosity. One PhD student (D4) will develop an equivalent to the Kozeny-Carman equation but with due consideration to anisotropy and modifications of the internal structure due to compaction.  It is therefore proposed to train 9 students (4 PhDs and 5 masters) in groundwater engineering.

"In recent years, technology and expertise that were originally developed for the telecommunications industry have been at the forefront of a revolution in medicine. Researchers and engineers can now build miniaturized biomedical devices that are highly portable, even small enough to be implantable in the body. Despite high enthusiasm and many groups around the world working in the field, however, this area is still in its infancy and its potential remains largely unfulfilled, though important successes have been realized to date. Indeed, building miniaturized biomedical devices that perform as well as their laboratory-based counterparts is a very difficult challenge.  The program proposed here addresses this challenge in two ways: 1) innovative research into next-generation miniaturized devices (biosensors) that incorporate capabilities that had hitherto been available only in laboratory-based platforms; 2) a highly interdisciplinary network of partnerships in micro/nanofabrication, pharmacology, and medicine working in concert. Existing biosensors for medical diagnosis, by virtue of their small size and difficulty to build are typically capable of detecting a single target (a virus for example) using a single detection method. In contrast, laboratory-based tests for a flu epidemic would use a battery of different tests on a number of different strains of the virus and obtain a diagnostic many times more reliable. The proposed program aims to conduct research into how this multi-target / multi-testing approach can be brought to the realm of miniaturize biosensors. The planned projects will study the impacts of integrating, on a single miniaturized device, several detection technologies: microcalorimetry, surface plasmons resonance, and fluorescence.  The challenge is particularly acute because of the anticipated mutual-interference problems, both technological and chemical, and difficulty in analyzing cross-coupled data, that will occur when trying to detect multiple biomolecular targets simultaneously on the same device. However, the impact of the program is likely to be very significant, both from scientific and healthcare points of view, by bringing vastly improved fast medical diagnostic technology at the point of care where it is needed.

"In the health care and pharmaceutical industries, affinity biosensors for detecting and analyzing biomolecular interactions have seen rapid development in recent years. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing is widely used in these applications due to several attractive features: it is label-free (i.e. no fluorescent tagging is required), real-time (allowing reaction kinetics to be measured), can be implemented in parallel (allowing high throughput screening and the use of multiple targets) and can provide quantitative affinity measurements.

Though several high-performance SPR systems are commercially available and have large established user bases, considerable research and development efforts continue both in universities and the private sector because the demands of cutting-edge medical and pharmaceutical research demand higher performance than the current systems can deliver. In surface-based biosensing systems such as SPR, two of the most difficult challenges facing the industry are: (1) how to overcome sensitivity limitations due to non-specific adsorption; (2) efficient mixing at the microfluidic level.

The objective of the proposed project is to bring to commercial production readiness a highly novel SPR prototype chip that integrates surface acoustic waves (SAW) transduction for accelerated mixing and desorption of non-specifically-bound parasitic biomolecules, resulting in increased sensitivity and reduced incubation times. The chip design is such that it can be produced commercially at low cost and be compatible with GE/Biacore SPR systems.

Dans les domaines de la sante et de 1'industrie pharmaceutique, 1'utilisation des biocapteurs pour la d�tection et 1'analyse des interactions biomol�culaires a connu de grandes avanc�es technologiques au cours des derni�res ann�es. Dans ces domaines, la r�sonance par plasmons de surface (SPR) est largement utilis�e comme technologie de d�tection de premier plan en raison de nombreux avantages : la non-necessite de marquage des cibles, la mesure de la cin�tique des r�actions en temps r�el, la possibilit� de mesures en parall�le a grande �chelle, et les mesures quantitatives de haute pr�cision.

Cependant, malgr� le fait que plusieurs syst�mes SPR soient commercialement disponibles, des efforts importants de recherche et d�veloppement sont en cours dans les universit�s et 1'industrie pour am�liorer les performances des syst�mes SPR actuels. En effet, ceux-ci ne r�pondent souvent pas compl�tement aux attentes fix�es par les recherches sans cesse plus pouss�es dans 1'industrie pharmaceutique. Tous les syst�mes de bio d�tection sur substrat solide sont limites par deux facteurs importants : (1) la diminution de la sensibilit� due a 1'adsorption non-sp�cifique de biomol�cules parasites et (2) les vitesses de r�action relativement lentes limit�es par la diffusion et le flux laminaire dans les syst�mes micro fluidiques.

"Bacterial virulence is defined as the aptitude of a bacterial pathogen to trigger injury to a host organism, which are essential for the implementation and the multiplication of the pathogen in its host. The identification of virulence factors, i.e. molecules involved in bacterial virulence, and their functional description represent an important on-going effort to understand the behavior of bacterial pathogens. It is also a crucial element for the development of novel anti-bacterial drugs and vaccines. 

The objective of my research program is to identify the molecular basis of the virulence factors deployed by pathogenic bacteria. Based on a solid proof of concept and on our own promising preliminary results, I propose to use Dictyostelium discoideum, a soil amoeba, which is a natural predator of bacteria, as an alternative host model to achieve this objective. This will allow new experimental possibilities like extensive genetic screening of both bacteria and host, which are not available when using traditional host models.

In the next five years, my research program will focus on the following short-term objectives: (1) evaluate the virulence variability of different strains of Aeromonas salmonicida, a fish pathogen used in my laboratory as a prototype of bacterial pathogens; (2) evaluate the effects of virulence factors secreted by this bacterium on the amoeba and identify their target in host cells; and, (3) identify and characterize new genes involved in A. salmonicida virulence.

My proposed research program, based on an alternative host model, will allow a better comprehension of the virulence factors used by A. salmonicida and by pathogens in general.

"There are many different geometries: Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic and others like the special geometry of spacetime.  



New objects can be created by taking a known geometrical space and ""gluing"" together points related by certain transformations.  For instance, if you take the ordinary plane with the transformations :

(x,y)->(x,y+n), n=0,1,2,...,-1,-2,...

gluing together related points gives you an infinitely long  cylinder of circumference 1.



Gluing points together can have some very interesting properties: looking closely, the result looks like the space we started from, but globally, it may be more complicated.



My research is on such spaces obtained from spacetime (2 space dimensions, 1 time dimension) and related spaces, such as the hyperbolic plane.



I am also interested in the emerging field of discrete differential geometry.  Here we take geometrical entities such as curvature of a space, and try to encapsulate their essence in a finite set of data, so that we may produce accurate pictures with a computer.

"In 2007, a Universit� de Sherbrooke team reported an innovative new tunnel barrier fabrication method that allows greater dimensional control on metallic single electron transistor (SET). This breakthrough innovation is now referred to by the semiconductor industry's roadmap (ITRS 2007). The proposed research program will use this novel fabrication technique to realize nanoscale superconducting Josephson junctions (JJ). Low temperature superconductor JJs have been made using mainly 2 methods: shadow evaporation (e.g. Al based quantum computing); planar metal-barrier-metal (e.g. Nb based rapid single flux quanta electronics, RSFQ). This novel technique will be the first major change in Josephson junction fabrication methods in the last 2 decades. Two significant outcomes are expected from this new technique: smaller area junctions could be achieved in niobium thus giving a greater freedom to balance charging and josephson energy in qubit designs (quantum computing bit); higher operation frequency (~500GHz) and integration density for RSFQ large scale circuits as expected by the RSFQ roadmap. Furthermore, this technique will allow tunnel barrier engineering even at ultra small area junctions, which is hardly possible with the conventional methods. The 1st phase of the program is to explore material issues related to fabrication and to superconducting properties of the resulting JJs. Niobium will be a candidate of choice but other materials will be considered. The 2nd phase will be to implement barrier engineering and study its effect on junction properties. The 3rd phase will aim at fabrication small scale superconducting circuits based on the developed technology. Applications to quantum computing qubit designs and RSFQ are considered. This research program has a unique potential for innovation by challenging the conventional fabrication methods. The required nanofabrication environment is already available and well supported. The program will also greatly benefit from my extensive expertise in superconducting nanostructures and from my extended local and international network in the field.

"This research will help meet one of the most challenging problems today: achieving sustainability in fisheries and in the human use of oceans and coasts, within Canada and globally. This challenge is highlighted by the 1990s collapse of Atlantic Canada's cod fishery, and the rapidly increasing pressures on coasts around the world. Accordingly, this research will contribute to improving management of fisheries, coastal and marine resource systems, and enhancing sustainability of marine ecosystems, fishing industries and coastal communities - providing guidelines for effectively formulating and assessing sustainable development strategies, in fisheries facing sustainability threats, and in coastal systems that need to balance competing uses. Specifically, the research will address the need for broader thinking on fisheries, coasts and oceans, through the ecosystem approach to fisheries, marine protected areas, integrated management, and local-level methods of coastal and ocean management. Three examples of the research to be carried out are as follows. First, I will study the lobster fisheries of Atlantic Canada, the most important in the region and among the most profitable in the world today, assessing the operation of the fishery and the choice of management options so as to improve fishery sustainability. Second, I will seek better understanding of how fisheries interact with marine protected areas (MPAs, parts of the ocean designated for special protection and management), by developing a decision framework for MPA implementation. Third, I will contribute to the theory and practice of local-level coastal management through an analysis of human and ecological aspects in specific bays such as Malpeque Bay, PEI, or Annapolis Basin, Nova Scotia. The multidisciplinary nature of this research plan will provide the opportunity for Canadian and international agencies to adopt new approaches that improve on the inefficient manner by which management took place in the past. Furthermore, this research will help train both undergraduate and graduate students, Canada's future researchers, in multidisciplinary approaches that address key environmental and sustainable development themes.","P�che commerciale","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","Industrial Engineering",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Nova Scotia","Nouvelle-�cosse"

"The microbial world harbours a wealth of DNA sequence information that can be harnessed for the production of bioproducts and enzymes that mediate industrially relevant chemical reactions. In some cases, the biological processes encoded by these gene products can produce high-energy organic compounds that may begin to directly replace fossil fuel-based technologies that are harmful to the environment. For many years, access to the full richness of the genetic material in the microbial world has been hampered by the inability to cultivate most microbes present in microbial communities. Molecular techniques now provide the methods to access the DNA from this uncultivated microbial majority; it is now possible to construct gene libraries from DNA that is extracted directly from a handful of soil, and these libraries then represent the genetic material from each of the microorganisms present in that soil sample. This captured environmental DNA (the 'metagenome') is hosted in readily cultivated bacteria and the corresponding expression of captured genes can be detected and screened for the expression of targeted gene products. In this way, diverse and novel genes from uncultivated microorganisms that carry out desired functions may be exploited, without the prerequisite of cultivation. This proposal describes the establishment of the Canadian MetaMicroBiome Initiative, a publicly accessible collection of libraries of environmental DNA representing Canadian soil microbial communities. Soil samples from disparate Canadian biomes will be chosen due to their unparalleled microbial diversity and corresponding metabolic richness. These DNA libraries will be characterized by powerful DNA sequencing techniques to determine the microbial community diversity of each sample. In partnership with Iogen Corp., we will show that there is DNA of interest in these environmental libraries by isolating new genes for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel and bioproducts applications. Detailed characterization of the enzyme activities and structures will aid in the development or improvement of processes for the production of high value-added chemicals.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario
"In the past decade, the determination of the complete sequences of bacterial genomes has radically altered microbiological research. Much effort is now directed towards the identification of the functions of newly discovered genes and transcriptional regulation pathways. The well-characterized bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti is a leading model system for this type of research. It forms alfalfa root nodules in which atmospheric nitrogen is converted to ammonia for the benefit of the plant, relieving the need for nitrogen fertilizers. S. meliloti cells use a variety of carbon substrates for growth; this omnivory probably contributes to ability to survive in the soil and near the plant roots. Several candidates for contribution to the catabolic capacity are found within the 78-member family of proteins called short chain dehydrogenases / reductases (SDR). In previous work, we have made mutations in all SDR-encoding genes in the S. meliloti genome, and through subsequent phenotypic analysis determined that several of them are in fact required for utilization of specific carbon sources, and for effective symbiosis with alfalfa. We will now focus on mutational analysis of genes surrounding each of the SDR-encoding genes, in an attempt to understand the mechanisms involved. We are also studying a key transcriptional regulatory system that is required for effective symbiosis, and is conserved in related bacteria that form symbiotic or pathogenic interactions with plants, animals and humans. We have developed a novel and simple DNA binding trap assay to identify potential transcriptional factor binding sites. We will use this assay to identify the targets for this transcriptional regulatory system, and then go on to study the functions of the target genes and evaluate their involvement in symbiosis. Finally, we are developing another bacterium, Ochrobactrum anthropi, as a model system for host pathogen interaction. Although this organism is quite closely related to the human pathogen Brucella, and is itself an opportunistic human pathogen, it also appears to be capable of a more versatile lifestyle in the soil and rhizosphere. Using comparative genomic analysis, followed by experimental analysis, we will investigate shared mechanisms.

"This XRD upgrade will provide the tools allowing for in situ diffraction and SAXS studies on a variety of nanostructured metal oxides (nanowires, tubes, spheres, etc.), quantum dots (QDs), and carbonaceous materials (carbon nanotubes, graphenes, carbon aerogels) being grown under supercritical and chemical vapour deposition (CVD). Here, in situ X-ray diffraction will  provide tremendous new insight to examine the crystal growth and kinetics of these novel nanostructured materials as they form using our unique reaction chemistries such as sol-gel in supercritical fluids, to provide fundamental information required for scale-up studies. In nanomaterials, a key requirement is to control their size, shape, and crystallinity, which directly controls their end-use properties. When using sol-gel chemistry to form metal oxides in the green environmentally friendly solvent, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), the alkoxide starting materials form hexamer crystal structure intermediates that subsequently react and self-assemble into various nanostructured morphologies. Simultaneously monomers can be polymerized to polymers that link to these nanocrystals. Here, the crystal structure of the metal oxide or polymer with inorganic component directly affects the morphology and properties of the final material. These nanostructured materials can also be grown from surfaces using novel techniques such as modified supercritical deposition with resulting thin films of nanotubulalar structure of interest for solar and fuel cells. Metal oxides and their inorganic-organic hybrids are of tremendous industrial and scientific interest being a current multi-billion dollar industry with many new exciting potential applications in alternative energy. As Charpentier and Suns research groups both examine growth mechanisms of nanostructured materials, these XRD tools will provide a powerful new ability required for scale-up and commercialization information when designing next generation nanomaterials.  These materials have transformative properties for use in alternative energy (solar materials, solar cells, fuel cells) and biomaterials (radiation dosimeters for cancer treatment using quantum dot nanoclusters).

"This NSERC Strategic project will explore developing new areas of nanotechnology to address several

previous shortcomings of solar thermal energy, making it much more viable and inexpensive, which has been

holding this technology back in North America from widespread adoption. Solar thermal panels are more

efficient for both heating and adsorption based cooling compared to photovoltaics. As over 80% of the fossil

fuels burned in Canada are for heating and cooling, this strategic NSERC strategic proposal can have a

significant impact on our way of life.

As part of this effort, the research program will focus on a disruptive platform for developing a new generation

of metal-dielectric nanocoatings and novel conductive polymer nanocomposites, and how these can be

manufactured to produce next-generation low-cost solar heating devices. Highly conductive polymer

nanocomposites will be synthesized containing graphene and carbon aerogel materials, with excellent heat

transfer and weathering capabilities for the solar absorber substrate. Transparent plastic outer coatings based on

self-healing/repairing polyurethane polymers containing nanostructured mixed metal oxides could greatly

lower the cost and weight of the solar panels, while providing the required high transparency and low

emissivity. For industrial cooling, high efficiency absorber nanocoatings will be prepared using advanced laser

and clean solvent sol-gel deposition technologies with unique features including thermochromic behaviour for

temperature control, self-cleaning behaviour for the conductive glass/coating, and high temperature stability for

adsorption cooling requirements.

The implications of this technology go far beyond solar thermal, and can be used for new solar materials for

photovoltaics, buildings, greenhouses, and automobile coatings.","Ressources d'�nergie (production, exploration, traitement, distribution et utilisation de l'�nergie)","Ressources d'�nergie","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Energy",2,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario

For instance, the simple act of storing and retrieving an object is something we have not yet managed to program a machine to do with anything approaching human efficiency and robustness. 

    )	My research aims to better understand how human cognitive system accomplishes the complex task of create (and enhance) representation from patterns as well as recognize, identify, categorize and classify them. In particular, this research focuses on an interesting nonlinear dynamics system perspective where time and change are the key variables. Within that perspective memory are represented as invariant states of the system.

    )	To understand how the human cognitive system works, we need to develop formal models. Nowadays, no formal models can take into account this variety of behavior without scarifying simplicity and self-consistency. In this research, we will use artificial neural networks that are parallel and where information is distributed among the units. Since the brain uses similar computing units and mechanisms for different tasks, this approach uses a general bidirectional associative memory model as building blocks for a general cognitive architecture. This model has the advantage to take into account both supervised and unsupervised learning and it can generalize to include other classes of models. In addition, this model has the flexibility to adapt itself in regards to neuropsychological constraints. Therefore, it is hoped that by developing a general bidirectional associative memory we will have a better understanding on how the mind works and how this understanding can be translated into artificial intelligence.

Around three million tons of Al is produced in Hall-Heroult cells in Canada every year and the competition from Russia and China is now very strong: the simulation tools proposed in this project will provide a unique advantage to Canadian Al-producers. The project is building on the previous NSERC-CRD Project ""A Virtual Laboratory for the Aluminum Industry"" also with Alcan, Alcoa and Hydro Aluminium. The proposed project will be divided in 2 themes with sub-projects: 1) Bath Chemistry and 2) Carbon Anodes Impurities and Additives. In the ""Bath Chemistry"" theme, we will extend the electrolyte transport properties model to reproduce and predict the ionic mobility, extend the thermodynamic, density and viscosity models. The project also aims at integrating the already developed models for NaF-AlF3-CaF2-NaCl-AlC13-CaC12 with A12O3-SiO2, K-based salts, CO2 dissolution and carbide dissolution. Models involving elements affecting the current efficiency of industrial cells, such as P, V, S, Fe will be considered. Dissolution of inert anodes elements will be considered. In the ""Carbon Anodes"" theme, we will develop a thermodynamic model for the reactions involving impurities (S, Na, Ca, Fe, Ni, V,...) and additives with CO2, NaAlF4 and air. This model can then be used to understand the fundamentals of the reactions increasing the carbon consumption in industrial cells. The project will be integrated in the FactSage thermochemical software package.","Produits des m�taux primaires (ferreux et non ferreux)","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"Thermodynamic and phase equilibrium modeling of multicomponent systems is of great industrial importance nowadays. The metallurgical and chemical industries commonly use thermochemical packages to simulate chemical reactions and phase equilibria for process development.  Multicomponent multivalent salts systems are widely used for the production and processing of metals.  Al electrolysis, coating of refractory metals, the next generation of nuclear reactors, promising electrolytes for Ti production all depend on molten salt chemistry. The thermodynamic and phase equilibrium modeling of multicomponent salt systems consists in expanding the Gibbs energy of a phase as a function of T, P and composition and finding a global energy minimum. Model parameters of the Gibbs energy functions are obtained by optimizing their values to best reproduce simultaneously the experimental data found in the literature (enthalpy, liquidus, etc.). Parameters form a database and the models are used to predict phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties in the multicomponent system. The Gibbs energy models must agree with the ionic structure of the multicomponent melt (oxidation states and coordination of ions), especially for complex chloro-fluoride melts dissolving some oxide components with cations of variables valency as the NaF-KF-NaCl-KCl-TiFx-TiClx (x=2, 3, 4) system. The proposed project consists in developing models and databases of parameters for the prediction of phase equilibria (liquidus and eutectic temperatures, stable products, vapor pressures) and thermodynamic properties (activities, enthalpy, Cp) of multicomponent reciprocal salts systems of industrial importance, with the novelty of taking into account the coordination numbers and oxidation states of the ions as they changes with composition.  Models will be developed for the NaF-KF-NaCl-KCl-TiF2-TiCl2-TiF3 -TiCl3-TiF4-TiCl4 and the AF-BeF2-ThF4-UF3-UF4-UF6 (where A is an alkali) systems. Solid solutions and pure compounds will also be integrated in the model. For the liquid solution, Ti and U will have several coordination numbers (4-8) and their relative stabilities with composition will be calibrated on measurements.

"In this proposed project, in collaboration with GM of Canada, we will develop thermodynamic, phase equilibrium and reaction models to better understand the phase relations in the microstructure, the forming properties and phase reactions during processing, casting and hot rolling of Mg alloys dedicated to automotive applications. These computational thermodynamic models will predict with the FactSage software the stable phase proportions and compositions, the metastability of non-stable phases, and the most stable products of reactions involving Mg-alloys with very reactive alloying elements such as Al, Ca, Sr, and the rare-earths, and with processing tools.  This will be done using thermodynamic modeling, where Gibbs energy expressions are developed: the parameters of such functions are calibrated by complex optimization techniques using published literature data (phase equilibrium, activity, enthalpies), experimental DSC, DTA, XRD and diffusion couples data obtained during this project, and First Principles calculations of enthalpies of formation of compounds and partial enthalpies of important solutes in solid solution. The proposed project will extend the thermodynamic modeling of Mg alloys, with the additional feature of estimating missing data from First Principles calculations for stable and metastable phases, for the following important systems (4 sub-projects): 1)Mg-Al-Li-Zn-Mn, 2) Mg-Al-Rare earths-(Mn), 3) Grain refiners (Ti, C, B, Zr) and 4) Mg-Al-Zn-Ca-Sr-(Mn). In addition, we will use the databases to predict proportions and compositions of phases present in the Mg alloys obtained by twin roll casting (TRC) and hot rolling (HR) at CANMET.  The databases will be used to guide CANMET researchers in selecting the best alloy composition and the best annealing temperatures according to the desired phase distribution.  This forms the 5th sub-project: Calculation of stable and metastable phases in TRC + HR of Mg alloys.

"Evolution acts most strongly on reproductive traits because they directly affect the success, or ""fitness"", of the organism. Consequently, mating behaviours are highly variable, and they often seem bizarre. My research seeks to understand some of the unusual mating behaviours evident in common garden snails. As a group, the Mollusca are not as well studied as some other taxa in respect to sexually selected traits. This is unfortunate because snail sex raises interesting questions. For one, the animals are hermaphrodites, and they copulate in a simultaneous, reciprocal manner. What mechanisms exist to ensure that neither animal cheats on its partner by receiving sperm but not delivering sperm? 

    Another question arises from the fact that, during courtship, each snail shoots a hard, sharp dart into the flesh of its prospective partner. Why would any animal treat its prospective sexual partner like this? Our previous work failed to find any consequence of dart shooting on the outcome of a courtship. Nor have we seen any harm caused by the dart in the recipient snail. Rather, our evidence indicates that successful dart shooting increases the number of offspring that will be sired by the shooter. We know that the dart is only effective when it injects a mucus substance. In the present research, we will try to identify the specific chemical that is responsible for the dart's influence on paternity. 

    Other aspects of this research concern neural mechanisms. We know that one particular lobe in the snail's brain is responsible for commanding the release of the dart. Because the snail can only afford to fire the dart in a serious mating situation, how does the brain recognize when that situation is present? What specific sensory cues cause the dart-commanding neurons to become active? A final project examines how the snails find sufficient calcium to build their shells and endow their eggs. We have discovered that they can smell calcium just like they smell food odours. Does the calcium sensitivity of the snail's olfactory apparatus use the same molecular receptor as that which senses calcium in the parathyroid gland of humans?

"Supercritical Fluid Flow Dynamics



Canada's bid to design the next generation nuclear reactor cooled by light water at supercritical pressure has raised the importance of research on supercritical flow dynamics.  It would be the first such nuclear reactor in Canada, and perhaps the western hemisphere.



With $400,000 from CFI and $100,000 from Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., a Supercritical Flow Facility (SFF) was built at the University of Manitoba, Dept of Mechanical Engineering, to further the understanding of supercritical flow instability, pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics.  The SFF is a vertically oriented natural-convection driven system that comprises three parallel heated channels on the lower, horizontal tier and a heat-exchanger on the upper horizontal tier.  It is designed to operate with supercritical CO2 and H2O and study (a) flow instability, (b) pressure drop and (c) heat transfer in the flow direction.  

The first set of experiments will run with supercritical CO2 because of the lower pressure (~10 MPa) and temperature (~35C) compared with supercritical water.  This will provide valuable experience to the researchers before adapting the facility to run with water, which will be at ~25 MPa and ~500C.  Mathematically, the stability behavior of CO2 has been shown to be similar to water -- hence, it is prudent to perform experiments first with supercritical CO2.  The experiments proposed here will be to conduct supercritical flow instability experiments as well as measure pressure drop for comparison with available correlations.

"The main focus of my research lies in the fundamental development of nuclear analytical, bioanalytical and speciation methods for the determination of total as well as species-specific concentrations of elements of environmental and toxicological interest. We develop instrumental, preconcentration and radiochemical neutron activation analysis (NAA) methods for measuring total concentrations at the trace and ultra-trace levels of elements with high precision, accuracy, specificity, and rapidity using short- and medium-lived nuclides. We also develop special separation and purification methods for the characterization of various species of elements followed by their determination using NAA. Our proposed research program consists of six different projects. One of these projects involves the characterization of the Dalhousie University SLOWPOKE-2 reactor neutron flux and other parameters for the development of k0-NAA based methods. Another project is designed to evaluate the analytical advantages of anti-coincidence and coincidence-coincidence gamma-ray spectrometry for the detection of short- and medium-lived nuclides. A third project deals with the development of a method for the simultaneous preconcentration of metal chelates from aqueous samples by cloud point extraction using green chemistry. A combination of ion exchange, liquid chromatography, solvent extraction, and distillation methods in conjunction with NAA is the basis for the simultaneous determination of various species of arsenic, antimony and selenium in aqueous and marine samples. In another project, we are developing solvent extraction, gel filtration, liquid chromatography, reversed-phase extraction chromatography, and esterification coupled to NAA for the separation and characterization of potentially toxic extractable organohalogens in marine fish and mammals.  We also investigate naturally occurring radioactive materials in drinking water and foods. We develop a number of analytical methods for studying various species of iodine in milk. Our research program provides training of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctorates, and visiting scientists in nuclear analytical, environmental, nutritional and toxicological chemistry.

"In order to illuminate Earth history during the Paleozoic Era (about 543 to 245 million years ago), I and my students collect and study invertebrate fossils. In particular, we collect trilobites and other arthropods as well as their traces, from a number of places around the world. We find, describe and illustrate spectacular new fossils, and then use details of their shapes, manners of preservation, diversity (numbers of species) and patterns of occurrence to create hypotheses about ancient events.  We select our field areas based upon where the fossils are best preserved and most abundant, but are poorly known. With these criteria, the information we discover is more important and novel. We reconstruct what the world looked like in the past, and how organisms interacted with each other and their environment. Another important aspect of our work is the analysis of the structures of these fossil organisms, using computers, in order to understand their relationships, based upon shared evolutionary advances, and create classification and naming schemes that reflect these relationships. This has led to the discovery of many new species and even genera or other higher categories. In the recent past, we have also discovered and described new skeletal structures in trilobites (eye shades) and in tabulate corals (spicules embedded in the soft tissues of their polyp animals). In a broader sense, we use the appearances and disappearances of the fossils in the rock sections to correlate the sections with one another and locate the horizons of episodes of mass extinction. We then study the rocks laid down during these times of extinction to find clues as to why these catastrophic events took place. If we can understand past levels of mass extinction, we may be able to avoid such catastrophies in the future. The work of my research group should substantially improve our knowledge of past organisms, and help us to understand why, when and where they evolved and then disappeared. The age correlations that we find between rocks of different regions are useful for understanding the time and space relationships between the rocks in those regions, and may have important economic applications in the exploration for hydrocarbon and mineral deposits.

"Joining of materials by various techniques such as welding and brazing is an important technique to manufacture, and repair aero and power generation turbines.  A major activity of Canada's multibillion-dollar aerospace industry is to manufacture and repair aircrafts and aero-engine components by different joining processes.  Unfortunately, most of the metallic aerospace materials, such as aluminum, titanium, and nickel based superalloys are difficult to weld and braze, and crack during the process. A crucial step in finding solution for their joining problems is through a thorough understanding of the effect of processing parameters on microstructure of pre-joined and post-joined materials.  Therefore,

 LONG TERM OBLECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH is ""To better understand materials science behind the influence of various metallurgical and joining parameters on microstructure of variously joined superalloys"".

In the last five years research on joining of IN738 was completed, research on Single Crystal (SX)) superalloys was started, and 3 MSc, 1 PhD students and 2 PDFs were trained with the Discovery Grant funds. 

GOALS FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS : ""To complete SX alloy research and start two new projects, 1) FRICTION STIR WELDING (FSW), and 2) GRAIN BOUNDARY ENGINEERING (GBE) of superalloys.  

THE PLAN: 1) Complete the weld cracking studies of SX alloys  and develop pre-weld treatments to prevent them. 2) Improve weldability of superalloys by GBE. Superalloys will be thermo mechanically processed to increase density of coincident site lattice GBs to reduce B segregation which should reduce GB liquation and, thus, HAZ cracking. 3)FSW is a solid state process and eliminates many weld defects inherent in fusion welding. This project would optimize FSW parameters to improve quality of welds. The influence of thermo mechanical deformation, associated with FSW, on microstructure and residual stresses in welds would be studied and used to model the FSW process to optimize the process parameters followed by actual friction stir welding of superalloys to validate the model.  4) Train 2 PhD, 2 MSc and 5 undergraduate students.

"Currently, a fundamental bottleneck in information technologies is the delay associated with electrical interconnects. Optical interconnects, on the other hand, are superior to electronic ones in terms of speed and bandwidth, but the diffraction limit of light restricts miniaturization and high-density integration.  Interfacing optical interconnects and electronic devices represents a major challenge in the advancement of information technology.  A promising solution is to use waveguides based on metallic surfaces that support surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs).  SPPs are electromagnetically coupled charge density oscillations on the surface of metals.  Subwavelength metallic structures can confine SPPs over extents smaller than the diffraction limit by ""squeezing"" electromagnetic energy near the surface of the metal.  Thus, plasmonic devices based on SPPs are capable of carrying optical frequency signals over a wide bandwidth without the size constraints faced by conventional light waveguides.  

The Subwavelength Optics and Plasmonics Laboratory in the School of Engineering at the University of British Columbia Okanagan aims to develop a new class of integrated plasmonic device for information and computation technologies.  This will be accomplished by developing:

1)    )	highly efficient, compact SPP waveguides and passive integrated devices based on photonic crystal concepts;

2)    )	microcavities for efficient SPP energy confinement; and

3)    )	on-chip SPP sources and detectors.

Achieving these objectives is important because integrated plasmonic devices, which combine the speed and bandwidth of optical interconnects with the miniaturization capabilities of electronics, hold the potential for revolutionizing information and computation technologies.

"The proposed research will contribute to Canada's leadership in the emerging area of academic rehabilitation engineering. In particular, our work will focus on:

(1) determining the relationship between subtle ""fractal"" patterns in human locomotion and energy expenditure; and

(2) studying the patterns of involuntary movement in children with cerebral palsy.



To realize the first objective, we will measure both energy consumed during walking and the timing of each step. Using nonlinear signal analysis methods and statistical comparisons, we will determine what relationship exists, if any, between the timing patterns (fractal dynamics) and energy expended. This work will generate new knowledge about how humans regulate quasi-periodic activities and why these fractal patterns are important to human movement.

      Regarding the second objective, we will engage children with cerebral palsy who have uncontrollable movements of the limbs and head. We will measure the motion of these body parts non-invasively while the child participates in a communication activity. We will subsequently mine the movement data for fractal patterns and changes thereof when the child responds to or initiates communication. We will develop new methods to detect subtle changes in motion signals, both from the fractal and conventional statistical perspectives.

      This research will lead to the development of new quantitative and objective assessments or outcome measures for rehabilitative interventions. Trainees will be drawn from many different engineering and science disciplines to work on exciting interdisciplinary problems, from developing new change point detection algorithms to relating energy parameters to timing patterns.","Sant� publique (y compris recherche psychologique li�e � la m�decine)","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Electrical and Computer Engineering",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"How the brain regulates behavior can be studied using animal models, which require specialized equipment for training experimental subjects. Operant conditioning chambers which were developed for this purpose can be configured for use in many different behavioral paradigms. For example, chambers can be equipped with auditory and visual stimuli that function as 'cues' to signal the occurrence of salient 'appetitive' events, such as the delivery of sucrose for oral consumption. Subjects rapidly learn to associate the cue with sucrose and will make stereotypical responses to the cue that can be measured to assess learning. Such models have enabled substantial progress in our understanding of the neural systems that are required for this form of learning. However, a cue that predicts a positive outcome can acquire a new meaning if the expected outcome is withheld. In this event subjects will gradually learn to inhibit responding to the cue. Surprisingly, little is known about how the brain regulates this form of highly adaptive 'new' learning.' My research program, for which a system of operant conditioning chambers is needed, will study the neural pathways that are needed to inhibit responding to cues that no longer predict positive outcomes. We will use behavioral models of learning in combination with other sophisticated techniques to probe underlying neural circuits. This research direction is highly unique and innovative, as very few laboratories study the neural basis of this type of learning in animal models of 'appetitive' learning. Given the dearth of information available on this topic, this program of study will contribute towards positioning Canada as an international leader in research on learning and memory.

"The objective of this grant proposal is to seek funding to permit face recognition studies on non-human primates. We have recently found that faces that are defined by dynamic cues are recognized above chance by human observers. This was surprising because although form-from-motion is a well-known visual phenomenon, veridical face discrimination is unexpected because it is known to be a very high-level process.



This finding has significant implications for the way that the two dominant visual streams-dorsal and ventral pathways-interact with each other. A face stimulus defined by dynamic cues must, according to our current understanding, arise in dorsal stream structures. However, face processing leading to recognition is widely accepted to be a ventral stream function. Our results imply that a significant degree of information relay must occur at the highest levels between the two streams to permit face recognition with dynamic cues.



The specific goal of the proposed study is to assess visual function in non-human primates using similar display protocols as with our study on humans. We wish to undertake this study in both an Old World and a New World species (vervet and marmoset monkeys, respectively). Face recognition performance has not been well documented in either species and therefore the planned experiments will break new ground in this area. Furthermore, a finding that vervets and marmosets are capable of recognizing faces defined by dynamic cues would imply that the interaction between the two streams generalizes across primates and pave the way for more detailed anatomical and physiological explorations of high-level visual function in these species.

"Innovative electromagnetic (RF, mm/THz and Optical) wave processing structures have become a critical subsystem in future generations of high performance, intelligent and reconfigurable radio/sensor system and networks. Integration of low profile radiating elements with compact and highly integrated multi-standard circuit packages, with minimum spurious emission, susceptibility, and harmful interaction with the critical parts of the circuit, has become an extremely challenging task in many new product development plans. Integrated antenna design and diagnosis, design and development of radiation resistant package/enclosure, analysis and characterization of interaction between the radiating elements and package, propagation modelling in novel integrated optical guides are among the most complex electromagnetic problems. Desire for the convergence of electronics and optics, leading to the silicon-photonics technology, provides another challenging task for the EM modelling research. The current proposal continues to build on our past successes in this field of research to address the latest foundational aspects of the challenging tasks outlined above.



 Above research requires development of highly efficient hybrid, multi-level, and multi-resolution computational models. These models are used as building blocks of global methodology for fast analysis and design optimization of the entire system and a part of the relevant physical surrounding. This in turn would enable research on new global system simulation and design strategies, which include computational models and characterization methods for analysis and diagnosis of antenna/radio systems, complex wave (RF, mm/THz and Optical) guiding and scattering phenomena, EMC and spurious emission. This is an industrially relevant and critical area, and the research would lead to novel scientifically based robust design methodologies for future wireless communication and sensing systems. Robust end-to-end simulation methodologies, computer-based diagnosis and tuning schemes are in high demand by Canadian telecommunication industries.

"Any final product passes through several different organizations before arriving to the market. These organizations in sequence contribute either by adding values/ features and/ or by pushing the product closer to the customer.  A smooth flow of the product is required for satisfying the customer demands at the competitive price. Any kind of hindrance in the product flow affects the company's competitiveness as well as the market share. The interruption in the product flow could be caused by several factors such as unavailability of the processing resources, limited supply of the materials, unpreparedness of the supply chain partners for the unexpected demand, etc.  A better coordination is necessary for better preparedness and efficient utilization of resources. 





In this research work, we are considering forest product based supply chain and identifying key points in the product flow channel which may possibly create severe hindrances when a variety of products (different models/ types) pass through the same channel.  Furthermore, improper planning and on time demand-supply mismatch may result in huge waste. Our objective is to develop advance planning tools for such supply chains. These planning tools will help companies in better coordination, efficient utilization of resources and eliminating the waste.

"Many people in Canada (and the world) want inventories of automotive and industrial engine emissions and need to know how emissions will be affected by changes in fuel, engine type, fleet make-up, application or work environment. Stakeholders include environmental groups studying effects of population and economic growth, government agencies designing regulatory changes, urban planners quantifying effects of infrastructure change and industrial fleet managers needing accurate numbers for GHG or criteria pollutant trading schemes. The fleets range from general urban traffic to specific fleets such as a fleet of transit buses or mine haul trucks. The accuracy with which these emission inventories can be compiled is not satisfactory and inventory tools are required which are both accurate and responsive to factors affecting emissions.

The common practice of multiplying utilization by a gram/km or gram/hr emission factor ignores strong effects of actual operation on emission rates. On-going work has shown that traffic signals and infrastructure, congestion, weather, vehicle loads and driver performance all affect emissions and these effects are being incorporated into emission models for urban traffic. There are still many classes of vehicles not covered and important input parameters to consider. Vehicles are also evolving towards more complex emission models. For example, hybrid electric vehicle emissions can vary dramatically when the actual driving pattern differs from the vehicle's ""design mission"". Plug-in hybrids add even greater variability since the energy source depends on how far and hard the vehicle is driven as well as how its charged.  This work is developing expertise and tools for in-use emission inventories for a range of vehicle and engine types including the general vehicle population, transit vehicles, transport trucks, ultra-heavy-duty trucks and stationary engines.

The research methodology uses on-board testing over a range of relevant ambient and driving conditions to measure emission effects of actual use. These studies will lead to emission inventory models responsive to engine and use parameters, especially those controllable by fleet management strategies.

"Food intake is a key biological process with a major impact on mammalian health. An understanding of the physiological mechanisms regulating food intake is important for developing strategies for treating health disorders of humans (e.g. obesity), and for enhancing the productivity of domestic livestock. The consumption of food stimulates the release of numerous peptides from the gastrointestinal tract (gut) that ultimately feedback to the brain to produce satiety. However, the mechanism(s) of action of a majority of these signals remains to be defined. The overall goal of my research program is to gain a fundamental understanding of the physiological mechanisms by which gut-brain peptides regulate food intake and body weight. This proposal concerns glucagon like peptide-1 (7-36)-NH2 [GLP-1] a peptide secreted primarily from the distal gut, and also ghrelin a peptide secreted mainly from the stomach. There is evidence, including some of our own data, to suggest that GLP-1 or GLP-1 receptor analogues potently reduce food intake and gastric emptying, and that ghrelin increases food intake and gastric emptying in a number of animal models and humans. In this project we will use a rat model for testing the hypothesis that GLP-1 secreted from the gut acts as a signal to the brain to regulate food intake and gastric emptying. This hypothesis provides the basis for the following specific aims:

1. Determine whether physiological doses of GLP-1 that reproduce meal induced increase in plasma GLP-1 levels are sufficient to inhibit food intake and gastric emptying. 

2. Determine whether systemic administration of exendin(9-39) (GLP-1 receptor antagonist) attenuates nutrient induced inhibition of food intake and gastric emptying. 

3. Determine whether GLP-1 inhibits food intake in part by inhibiting the secretion and/or actions of ghrelin on food intake and gastric emptying.

The outcomes from this proposal will enhance our understanding of the role of GLP-1 in appetite regulation and thus contribute significantly to the overall picture about how food intake and body weight are regulated.

"GPCRs (G-protein coupled receptors) constitute the largest and the most diverse group of membrane proteins. Humans are capable of detecting five tastes which are, sweet, umami, bitter, sour and salt. While the signal transduction for sweet, umami and bitter tastes are through GPCRs, the sour and salt tastes are sensed by ion channels. The molecular events in the perception of bitter taste start with the binding of specific water-soluble molecules (tastants) to the transmembrane domains of bitter receptors initiating an intracellular signaling cascade. However, the molecular mechanisms of action of these bitter receptors are poorly understood. Knowledge about how bitter receptors interact with their tastants will enable design of artificial tastants that enhance food flavor. This research program focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction by bitter receptors using a combination of cellular, biochemical and biophysical approaches, and will enhance our understanding of bitter taste perception.

"The aim of this research program is to synthesize functional nanomaterials and develop a fundamental understanding of their electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties. Nanomaterials are both scientifically interesting and technologically important. Their unique electronic, optical and catalytic properties provide a great opportunity to develop novel catalysts for Green Chemistry applications and to design electrochemical sensors with high performance for environmental analysis. This research program will address the fundamental issues of the relationship between structure and reactivity at nanostructured electrochemical interfaces to contribute to the knowledge base needed to tailor efficient catalysts and to design novel electrochemical sensors. 

          This research program builds on the work currently being carried out in my research group. The long-term objective is to develop new Green Technologies for the remediation of industrial waste streams, for sustainable hydrogen energy development and to design electrochemical sensors with high performance for glucose and pollutants analysis. The specific objectives are: (i) to design and fabricate functional nanomaterials such as platinum, palladium, carbon, iridium oxide and titanium oxide based nanostructures; (ii) to understand the adsorption, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical oxidation of hydrogen, sulfur compounds, glucose and phenolic pollutants on these nanomaterials; (iii) to determine the effect of size and morphology on the electrocatalytical and photocatalytic activity of the nanomaterials; and (iv) to functionalize titanium oxide nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes/nanofibres for enzyme immobilization. The economy of Northwestern Ontario relies heavily on the mining and pulp & paper industries. Electrochemical technology is widely used in metal production, the chemical industry and the pulp & paper sector. This proposed research program would become a key regional resource for these industries in the training of professionals with expertise in electrochemistry and environmental science.

"The pulp and paper industry plays a key role in the Canadian economy and Canadian communities. Due to the numbers of large new, modern pulp and paper mills that are coming on-line in countries where fibre supply is large and manufacturing costs are significantly lower than in traditional paper-producing countries, the Canadian pulp and paper industry is facing a huge challenge. The Minister's Council Report of Forest Sector Competitiveness released on June 13, 2005 identified at least 12 forest industry mills at risk of closure in Ontario alone. Northern Ontario communities have already been battered by mill closures. Several thousand direct jobs have been lost over the past four years. Should all 12 at-risk mills close, entire communities in the north will be severely impacted with economic recovery next to impossible; 38,000 direct and indirect jobs will be lost; and $1 billion will be lost in tax revenues annually. As concluded in the PaperWeek International Reporter on Feb. 6, 2007, the Canadian pulp and paper industry must identify new value-added products in order to compete.



Over a three-year period, we will closely work with our industrial partners, Bowater Canadian Forest Products Inc., The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and FPInnovations, Paprican (i) to determine the optimum conditions for lignin precipitation; (ii) to develop a novel technology for lignin oxidation, which would convert a renewable and sustainable resource that is presently treated mainly as a low value biomass energy product into value-added lignin products such as replacement for carbon black; and (iii) to identify the products resulting from the lignin oxidation. This project will constitute a response to the depletion of non-renewable fossil resources and will contribute to promote Canadian leadership in green chemistry and a bio-based economy. The findings gained from the proposed research would help the development of novel technologies for economically utilization of lignin and will greatly benefit the pulp and paper industry.

"How do the properties of atomic nuclei affect the stars?  What is the origin of the elements that make up our world and us? My research focuses on measuring in the laboratory the nuclear processes and properties required to answer this question.  We now know that nuclear processes are responsible for the starlight that we see, and for producing almost all the chemical elements around us, including the ones that make up our bodies.  In particular, many of the elements heavier than iron must be made in stars that are extremely hot, up to a billion degrees, and these temperatures can only be found in certain stellar explosions, such as supernovae, novae, and X-ray bursts, for example.  At these temperatures, the atomic nuclei that determine the energy generation and the nucleosynthesis are not the familiar, stable ones, but rather are unstable nuclei that, once formed, decay away quickly.  Experimental information on how these unstable nuclei behave is crucial for our understanding of how these explosions happen, but they are extremely difficult to produce in the laboratory.  This nuclear physics information, together with improvements in the modeling and observations of these exploding stars, will help us understand how they happen, thereby elucidating a piece of our own cosmic history.



Laboratory experiments involving accelerators and beams of stable nuclei help provide some important clues.  Furthermore, in recent years, for the first time we have been able to perform experiments with unstable beams, reproducing the actual nuclear processes that happen in stars.  Canada, in particular, has built one of the best facilities in the world for nuclear astrophysics studies with radioactive beams, called TRIUMF-ISAC, in Vancouver.  My research centres on using the TRIUMF-ISAC facility and other world-class laboratories abroad, where over the next few years, we will be performing several interesting experiments that will place our understanding of stars and the origin of the elements on firmer ground.

"Today, more than 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides are used annually in North America by a variety of industries (e.g., agri-food industry, forestry, and lawn/landscaping industry), with up to 98% of the pesticide residues entering and contaminating the environment. Recently, the growing concerns on pesticide pollution have demanded more in-depth and comprehensive modeling and experimental studies for effectively supporting best management practice and sound pollution control. This proposed research attempts to meet such a demand. The major objective is to develop an integrated simulation-optimization coupling approach for supporting pesticide pollution control, which entails tasks of pollution simulation, practice optimization, decision making under uncertainty, and experimental analysis. The developed methodologies and associated technologies will be examined through multi-scale lab and field experiments in Newfoundland. The proposed research will comprehensively take into account a number of uncertain economic and environmental concerns arising in pesticide pollution control, and will be directly useful for both generating more cost-effective alternatives and improving control decision robustness. This search will help governments to improve their effectiveness and capabilities in controlling the challenging pesticide pollution problems in Canada; it will also benefit industries by providing them with efficient and cost-saving methods for the design and planning of their pesticide management and pollution control practices. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will be involved throughout the research program and provide their input in a multidisciplinary research setting. The trained graduates will fill a pressing need for environmental and management professionals in industrial, consulting, governmental, and academic sectors, and contribute to Canadian competitiveness and advancement.

"During the next five years, I will conduct research on the following topics: I am interested in developing new statistical methods for the analysis of clustered recurrent events in epidemiology and clinical trials. In many clinical studies, recurrent event data arise when certain event may occur repeatedly over a period of time. For example, in cardiovascular trails, strokes may occur repeatedly over time; cancer patients may experience recurrent metastases tumors; patients with organ transplant may experience multiple rejection episodes. I will study the nonparametric estimate of the cumulative mean function of cluster recurrent events. I will extend methods for clustered recurrent events data and exploit and estimate the correlation structure among clustered subjects. 

    In clinical trials, it is often of interest to examine the interactions between the treatment and certain continuous biomarkers such as hormone reception level, the body mass index (BMI) etc. A new treatment , for example, may show a overall benefit, it is possible that subsets of patients with certain hormone reception level may obtain more benefit while others may not benefit or even be harmed by the new treatment. I plan to develop resampling-based methods to detect treatment and biomarkers interaction pattern in clinical trials.  My long term goal in this area is to explore how to use smooth functions to characterize the interactions between treatment and continuous covariates.

    Finally, to study marginal methods for multivariate recurrent events with missing event type, I will focus on the second order estimating equations for the variance-covariance parameters. My long term objectives are to study new statistical methodology to deal with challenge arising from the analysis of survival data and recurrent events, such as cluster correlation, dependent censoring and multiple hypothesis testing.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Statistical Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"This proposal is to request (a) an upgrade for an existing 4-port performance network analyzer (PNA-X) to have the microwave noise measurement capability, and (b) an enhancement for an existing Automatic Tuner System (ATS) to work with this 4-port PNA-X. These crucial upgrades enhance the research program in the investigation of high-frequency (HF) noise in semiconductor devices, especially for sub-100nm Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs), from device characterization to low-noise, radio-frequency (RF) and/or high-speed integrated circuit (IC) designs.

The economic implications of these novel technologies that have considerable potential for significant spin-off activities cannot be overstated. All efforts will be taken to fully exploit the research results commercially, generate economic benefits, and therefore fuel the Canadian economy. Commercialization of new technologies to be developed is expected to be realized through patents, and transfer of technology to industrial research partners. Potential users of the research results include manufacturers associated with the semiconductor manufacturing, microelectronics, and telecommunication industries. In addition, the requested infrastructure will be used extensively in collaboration with industrial partners, with the objective of empowering them with the competitive edge that is vital to excelling in the present economic scenario.

"Our research program is built on the premise that chemical separation is driven by physical field and chemical equilibrium.  With the insights into how molecules are separated and detected in capillary columns, we wish to design novel instruments that can provide even more separation power for chemical analysis and purification.  Interestingly, newly designed instruments come with newly created problems to be solved, and new phenomena to be explained.  Our group enjoys meeting these challenges with the many powerful tools available to us including what we have learned in physics, mathematics, computer science, and most importantly, chemistry!



The first part of our research program is to design novel instrumentation for larger scale purification systems based on the infinite resolution theory we developed in the past.  By balancing the electrophoretic and hydrodynamic forces acting on analytes in solution, we can selectively manipulate their flow direction.  Having established this technology in single capillaries, we are now working on multiple capillary systems to improve the capacity and yield of chemical purification.



The second major part is to develop novel interfaces for capillary electrophoresis- electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS).  The currently available interfaces suffer from several deficiencies stemming from the lack of understanding of the fundamental processes involved in CE and MS separately, as well as when the two techniques are interfaced. By redesigning the shape and geometry of the sprayer, the chemical properties of the surfaces, solution compositions and the electrical circuits that drive the processes, we are developing robust and more efficient CE-MS interfaces that we hope will give improved performance in both CE separation and MS detection.

"Environmental modeling often requires inputs of detailed land cover and vegetation data at different spatial and temporal scales. Airborne and satellite remotely-sensed data play a key role in generating categorical maps such as land cover because of its capacity of collecting data over broad expanses of land. With widespread use of remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) technologies, a great deal of earth observation data has been accumulated along with a wide range of spatial, spectral and temporal scales. These developments demand significant changes in the approach of analyzing and integrating these earth observation data. The effects of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions on the classification accuracy of land cover and other categorical maps have received growing attention. Compared with rapidly growing data availability, there is a clear lag in the development of analysis methods and efficient error models for handling multi-scale data of increasing complexity and quantity.



The objectives of this project are: a) to examine the sensitivity of classification errors and uncertainty on land cover classification procedures at different resolutions and landscapes; b) to evalute the accuracy of different sub-pixel mapping approaches; and c) to develop error models and calibration approaches for linking classification errors across different resolutions. The long-term goal is to understand error and uncertainty on categorical maps generated from remotely sensed data. This project will develop a theoretical framework for modeling classification errors contained in categorial maps across scales and and using them to develop better and more robust parameter sets for a variety of environmental applications such as regional and global climate change, hydrological, land use/cover and other environmental modeling. Within the proposed budget and research scope at least two graduate students and two undergraduate students will be trained each year.

"Zirconium is often added in aluminum wrought alloys to refine the grains, increase the strength and provide a better resistance to recrystallization. However, the addition of Zr may lead to the precipitation of undesirable zirconium intermetallic crystals and cause a number of casting process related problems and defects in the cast products. It is observed in some cases that interaction of Zr with other alloying elements (Fe, V, Ti and B) and poisoning effect of Zr on the Ti and TiB2 grain refinement have a great detrimental effect on the properties of final products. The main objective of this study is to better understand the effect of zirconium and its intermetallics on the fabrication processes and final product properties. Using thermodynamic calculation and physical experiments under controlled conditions, the formation of zirconium intermetallics and the solubility limit of zirconium in a typical 7xxx alloy will be investigated. The impact of the Zr level and the cooling condition on the nucleation, growth and morphology of zirconium intermetallic crystals will be examined using optical metallography and scanning and transmission electron microscopes. The mechanisms of the interaction of Zr with other alloying elements (Fe, V, Ti and B) in term of intermetallic formation, grain refinement and anti-recrystallization will be systematically studied. After the characterization of zirconium intermetallics in a typical alloy, the research will go through the 7xxx series alloy family to analyze the impact of complex Zr bearing intermetallics and to evaluate the resulted material properties. The information gained through this study can greatly help the aluminum industry to enhance the productivity and product quality for a number of important wrought alloys.","Sciences des mat�riaux","Avancement des connaissances","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Understanding the effects of plant interaction, forest development, and environmental factors on forest productivity, carbon sequestration, and diversity is crucial for Canada to develop adaptation strategies for a changing environment.  During the past 5 yrs, my research program has focused on dynamics of stand structure and understory vegetation, forest succession, and the influences of silvicultural intensity on forest productivity, structure, and composition of the central boreal mixedwood forest. The overall objectives of the proposed research for the next 5 yrs are to: (1) further examine species mixture effects on above- and belowground productivity to test the hypotheses of niche complementarity and competition-facilitation shift, and on plant diversity to test resource quantity and heterogeneity hypothesis; (2) further study stand dynamics by investigating above- and belowground production processes to test whether productivity and carbon sequestration peak at intermediate stand age, if old growth forests are a carbon source or sink, and if belowground productivity and carbon sequestration mirror aboveground dynamics; and (3) investigate boreal forest response to global climate change by testing if tree height and diameter growth of trembling aspen, white birch, jack pine, black spruce, and white spruce in the central boreal forest have increased with increasing global temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration for the past two centuries, if greater increases of growth have occurred in higher latitudes, and if different species have responded differently. The proposed program will involve training existing students and associates (6 PhDs, 4 MScs, 2 PDFs, 2 visiting professors, and 2 technicians) and an additional 13 (5PhD, 5 undergraduates, and 5 assistants). The results will be published in various media including peer-reviewed journals, theses, conferences, and workshops. The further improved understanding of the dynamic processes of productivity, carbon sequestration, and diversity of the central boreal forest will help develop better forest management strategies to cope with global climate changes.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Evolution & Ecology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Motivated by a problem faced by a flat panel television distributor, we consider product replenishment and pricing decision making problem for the (durable) product with short life cycle.  Specifically, we consider joint pricing and inventory control in an inventory system where the procurement cost may be time-varying and the demand may depend on the cumulative past sales. The procurement cost of a product is closely related to the production cost which may reduce over time due to learning effect or increase due to increased raw material and labor cost. While such phenomena are pervasive, they have not been well-studied in the literature in general. We first focus on identifying the structure of the inventory control when the procurement cost varies over time. The second part of our proposed research focuses on the durable product with short life cycles such as cell phones, TVs and computers. It has been well-studied in the marketing literature on the diffusion of the innovative (durable) product. Both theoretical model and empirical evidence supports that the sales during the product life cycle change over time and are dependent on cumulative past sales. We study optimal pricing and inventory control in such environment; this extends the existing literature that usually assumes the current demand does not depend on past sales. Then, we consider a hybrid of the above two models, where the demand is dependent on past cumulative sales, and the procurement cost is time-sensitive. Finally, we propose an empirical validation for the above models. 



The completion of the proposed research will provide a solid foundation for modeling and analysis of an inventory system with time-varying procurement cost and price and historically dependent demand.  This extends the existing operations management literature on the pricing and inventory control, and complements the marketing literature on the innovative product diffusion process with the operational decision such as inventory replenishment.

"Data on hundreds of thousands of genetic variations (e.g. gene expressions) of human beings are routinely collected by geneticists in the hope of identifying, among them, a handful that are responsible for various diseases having a genetic component, such as diabetes and cancers. Statistical methods are then used to analyze the data to complete the task. Yet such data analyses are far different from the ones that classical statistical methods are designed to deal with. With huge number of candidates under investigation but limited number of samples, many genetic variations can appear to be culprits purely by chance. Developing statistical theories and methods to determine the strength of evidence needed to identify the true set of responsible genetic variations is an area of intensive research. This proposal focuses on problems in this general area. We view the statistical problem from a model selection angle. Every group of genetic variations can be used to construct a statistical model to predict the disease status. A sensible criterion is used to judge their relative merits, and therefore, enables us to select an optimal one among a huge number of candidates. There are two important aspects in this development. First, the criterion must be adaptable to various statistical models with well understood good theoretical properties. Secondly, the criterion can be implemented without an exceedingly high computational complexity. That is, computational strategy should be developed together with the criterion.

"Health care spending continues to grow faster than our economy and becomes a major financial burden to the society (Provincial and territorial government health spending surpassed $100 billion in 2007). Drugs have consumed the second-largest share of health dollars (second after Hospitals) since 1997. The fermentation process is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry to grow microorganisms and produce drugs, like antibiotics. In this strategic research, the applicants propose to collaborate with researchers at Apotex Fermentation Inc. and Alberta Research Council to design low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) devices for microorganism growth. LIPUS is chosen because a form of mechanical energy generated by the LIPUS device can pass through into microorganism as acoustic pressure waves that can stimulate microorganism growth. Our piezoelectric transducers are biocompatible and are easily modified for fermentation use. The proposed research includes: (i) developing a novel LIPUS device that can stimulate microbial growth and enhance gene and protein expressions to increase fermentation-based drug yield; (ii) demonstrating that the proof-of-concept designs can be used in the fermentation processes to produce predictable microbial growth; (iii) extending this new technology for industrial applications. Our design is innovative because no research group worldwide has proposed to use LIPUS for enhancing microorganism growth.

NSERC has invested a great amount of money in fundamental research. The proposed research will enhance the collaboration between academia, government lab and industry. The proposed research is also in line with NSERC strategic research plans in the area of ""Competitive Manufacturing and Value-Added Products and Processes"". By applying LIPUS technology, the yield of fermentation-based drugs could improve significantly. As a result, the project can reduce health costs and enhance the ability of Canadian drugs to compete in global markets. In all, this project will significantly benefit the Canadian economy.

"CBM-CFS3 is the current version used to estimate Canada's managed forest carbon budget for reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and to assist in formulating forest management options in Canada's effort to cope with climate change. The model is based on forest inventory data with complete consideration of all major carbon cycle components.  The  core of the model is a set of volume-age curves derived from inventory and plot-level forest growth and yield data from across Canada.  These curves capture the general pattern of past forest growth but do not account for interannual variations in climate nor can they, by themselves, respond to projected future changes in climate and atmospheric composition. The Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Model (InTEC) makes use of the forest age structure and disturbance data compiled by CFS researchers and estimates forest growth and all other major carbon cycle components using a process-based approach. The strength of this model lies in its integration of both disturbance (fire, insect and harvest) and non-disturbance (climate, C02 and nitrogen deposition) effects on the carbon cycle. The weakness of the model may be the lack of validation of the key curves that define net primary production (NPP) over age and affect regrowth estimation after disturbance. The proposed research aims at improving both CBM-CFS and InTEC models by combining their strengths and making both models more comprehensive.  Our first priority will be to enhance the current version of CBM-CFS3 with a non-disturbance module from InTEC to simulate the effects of climate variability and the trends of long-term changes in atmospheric C02 and nitrogen inputs on undisturbed and regrowing forests. We will also use an existing dynamic vegetation model to capture potential responses of vegetation species and structure to climate change. These new capabilities in support the development of the next generation CBM-CFS (Version 4) will improve the estimation of Canada's forest carbon budget for reporting purposes and enhance the ability to support policy analyses of climate mitigation and adaptation strategies in the Canadian forest sector.","Climat et atmosph�re",Environnement,"Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Environment",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario

"Network data compression, also known as Slepian-Wolf coding, is a far-reaching generalization of Shannon's point-to-point lossless source coding to the distributed network scenario. However, the impact of the fundamental theory of Slepian-Wolf coding on practical network data compression techniques is still very limited. Most existing network data compression schemes are direct combinations of conventional point-to-point data compression methods, and cannot fully exploit the potential as promised by the theory of Slepian-Wolf coding. 



The proposed research is designed to enable Slepaian-Wolf coding theory to realize its potential as a theoretical foundation of network data compression. We shall explore the intimate connections between Slepian-Wolf coding and channel coding in terms of rate-error tradeoff and operational duality. The emphasis will be on obtaining guidelines for the design of practical network data compression schemes. We shall explore alternative formulations of distributed network data compression theory that incorporate variable-rate encoding, universal decoding, mismatched decoding, and asynchronous Slepian-Wolf coding. In addition to strengthening the theoretical foundation of network data compression, the proposed research will provide a systematic framework for practical Slepian-Wolf code construction that can meet the requirement of real world applications. The proposed research could find applications in many different areas. Besides its obvious usefulness in conventional networks, network data compression techniques can also be potentially used in video coding, secure fingerprint biometrics, secret key generation, data hiding and watermarking. 

The proposed research will be integrated with educational activities to attract talented students to work in this fertile interdisciplinary area and help them develop their engineering and mathematical skills in line with the needs of academia and Canadian information technology industries.

"A jet engine should operate at very high temperatures to maximize its fuel efficiency and power. As combustion gases are often held at temperatures well above the melting points of engine superalloys, engine turbine blades must be cooled and protected from the hot combustion gases. Therefore, it is strongly required to develop a thermal barrier coating (TBC) (bond coat and topcoat, thermal growth oxide (TGO) will be formed between bond coat and topcoat during the service) to increase the operational lifetime of jet engines and permits higher operating temperatures, thereby increasing thrust and fuel efficiency. More durable thermal barrier coatings with novel TBC materials are needed to significantly reduce high operational and maintenance costs.  Although a TBC's failure involves a number of contributing factors, the two main factors, (a) the interfacial structure and adhesion between the bond coat/TGO and topcoat/TGO, and (b) the thermal property mismatch among these layers, remain the major challenge in TBC's fracture spallation. The overall objective of the proposed project is to evaluate interfacial and thermal properties of TBC materials. This can be achieved by using a combination of ab initio density functional theory and lattice dynamics calculations. In this project, (1) the interfacial properties between bond coat/TGO, topcoat/TGO and bond coat/topcoat will be systematically investigated; (2) the positive effect and mechanism of Platinum on the interface of bond coat/TGO will be  identified; (3) the detrimental effect of Sulfur on TBC lifetime and reactive element additions on interface will be investigated; (4) elastic moduli and thermal properties will be calculated for topcoat, bond coat and TGO with a purpose to develop new topcoat materials with lower thermal conductivity; (5) experimental testing will be conducted to validate the calculated results.  The systematic theoretical modeling at atomistic scale should help elucidate ways to optimize the interfacial properties for maximizing thermal insulation and minimizing spallation of TBC coatings.","Sciences des mat�riaux","Avancement des connaissances","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Radiation affects the operation of electronics and can lead to total failure or destruction of the exposed components. The consequences to systems controlled or supported by irradiated electronics could be disastrous. The proper operation of electronics in radiation environments is of paramount importance to the space industry, the military, nuclear reactors, high energy physics experiments, and more recently, to the application of large commercial memories in everyday terrestrial environments. The high cost of maintaining dedicated foundries to create radiation tolerant electronics has motivated the exploration of alternatives for next-generation systems. Recent research using advanced commercial electronics manufacturing processes have shown them to be resistance to radiation provided some design precautions are taken. 



A technology will be developed with a commercial process that can provide enough radiation tolerance for space microelectronics. This project can result in the development of a radiation-hardened, low-power 32-bit stack-based microprocessor which is a collaborative research project with Microelectronics and Signal Processing Brach, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The fault-tolerant approaches for programmable devices will also be investigated.  



This research has significantly increased the availability and reduced the cost of radiation-tolerant electronics. This proposed technology enables commercial foundries instead of dedicated foundries to manufacture radiation-tolerant circuits broadly used in scientific spaceflight instrumentation thereby greatly reducing costs. Additionally, this approach will likely improve the performance of space electronics. The proposed technology is key to space explorations as well as other applications where radiation effects are a concern.

"Optical fibers are the pipeline of the telecommunication. Researchers in both academics and industries are investigating all optic fiber networks that limiting the electro-optic conversion at the receiver and transmission ends. However as the bandwidth and speed exceed the data rate of 10GB/s per wavelength channel many of the existing fiber networks are not able to carry the information without suffering severe signal degradation. The limiting factors include fiber nonlinearity, polarization mode dispersion (PMD), polarization dependent loss (PDL), and chromatic dispersion (CD). Fiber nonlinearity describes the material's polarizability change by light's intensity and PMD is the polarization dependence of the light propagation speed. PDL is the polarization dependence of the signal attenuation and CD is the wavelength (color) dependence of the propagation speed. Furthermore those physical effects interact and their values are affected by environmental conditions like temperature, wind induced strain in field fibers. This proposal develops reliable simulation, emulation and compensation tools for the fiber communication network. The objective of this communication research is to advance the future all optic fiber networks. One of the nonlinear effect, namely stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), describing the coupling of acoustic phonon with the light, could also slow the signal propagation due to the nonlinear change of refractive index. Researches will be conducted in this aera of Brillouin slow light in conventional communication fibers as it is one of the key enabling technology as an optical buffer tuned by light itself. SBS effect in fiber can also be employed as a sensor since its Brillouin spectra are related to local temperature and strain. Due to fiber's flexability and tiny size the SBS based fiber sensors find vast area of applications, e.g., monitoring safty of large structures, fire alarms, oil and gas pipeline failure warnings, etc. The proposed study on sensing is to develop fast signal processing tools to enhance the accuracy of the temperature and strain measurements. This sensing research will have enormous practical impacts to the safty of our large civil structures (e.g., recent tragedy at highway overpass in Laval Quebec could be detected early).

"The incorporation of nutraceutical compounds into food systems provides a convenient approach to develop novel functional foods to reduce the risk of chronic disease and/or improve public health. The essential problem is that many nutraceuticals have low bioavailability by oral administration. 

     The long-term goal of my research program is to maximize the bioavailability of nutraceutical compounds by developing novel nano-delivery systems based on biopolymers. Proteins are especially interesting for wall materials because they are food components degradable by digestive enzymes; they have excellent functional properties to form emulsions, gels and films; and they offer possibilities for reversible binding of nutraceuticals and protecting them until their release at the desired site. A better understanding of the molecular basis of protein nanoparticle formation is essential for rational development of structurally sound delivery systems. Therefore, the objectives of the proposed research are to: (1) study the molecular basis of nutraceutical binding to food proteins; (2) investigate the mechanisms of protein nanoparticle formation and correlate protein molecular and supramolecular level structures to nano-scopic features of the resulting particles; and (3) link the structures characterized in (1) and (2) to the stabilizing effect of the nanoparticles.

     The basic knowledge generated by this research will advance our knowledge for design of efficient delivery systems from molecular level, which is the foundation for a network of other research in the development of new health products in the lucrative functional food market. The future collaboration between research and industry is an opportunity to improve the health of Canadians, reduce health care costs, and position the Canadian functional food industry as a world leader. The pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries will also benefit from the outcomes of this research. This research will also provide new and diversified opportunities to add value to Canadian core agricultural commodities (cereal and milk) by converting them into new bio-products (nano-delivery systems) to increase producers' profitability and sustainability.

"A new experiment is being developed at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO), Canada's world-leading neutrino physics facility. The experiment is called SNO+ and it consists of filling the SNO detector with a liquid scintillator now that the heavy water that was in SNO has been removed. By turning SNO into SNO+, a multipurpose experiment with diverse scientific goals would be created. SNO+ will be able to address fundamental questions in particle physics, in geophysics, and in astrophysics. SNO+ will start where SNO leaves off and it will expand our understanding of the neutrino and its impact on the physical universe.

  A liquid scintillator emits 100 times more light when a neutrino interacts in it compared to a neutrino interaction in water. This means that SNO+ will be able to detect neutrinos with lower energies. Lower energy neutrinos from the Sun will be studied to shed light on the properties of neutrinos and the energy generation processes in stars. Separately, antineutrinos from natural radioactivity in the Earth will be detected by SNO+. SNO+ will thus be able to assay the total amount of uranium and thorium radioactivity in the deep Earth. The fraction of Earth's heat that originates from radioactivity is a fundamental question that could be answered.

  An extremely rare nuclear decay will be studied in SNO+ by dissolving neodymium in the liquid scintillator. Observation of this process, known as neutrinoless double beta decay, would shed light on the fundamental nature of the neutrino with potential impact on our understanding of matter and antimatter in the Universe.

  SNO+ has been conducting R&D, funded by NSERC since April 2005. In 2007 SNO+ has been completing full technical designs for the engineered components of the new detector. At this point in the development of the project, SNO+ is ready for implementation. We are ready to move forward with capital construction and this proposal requests funding for a portion of the capital costs of the SNO+ experiment, with the remainder to be requested from a CFI infrastructure grant. This proposal also includes amounts to support SNO+ research activities at Queen's, Alberta and Laurentian.

"The proposed research will follow an integrated system approach to study closed-loop supply chain management (CLSCM) and related issues. A forward supply chain (FSC) is concerned with material and components supply for new products, new product production, product distribution, transportation and delivery to customers. A reverse supply chain (RSC) is concerned with collection of used and reusable materials, transportation, sorting and inspection and remanufacturing to make them ""as good as new"" products. Extensive research has been done addressing different problems related to FSC and RSC. In recent years, many remanufacturing related problems have also been studied. However, research on CLSCM has been mainly focused on problems related to logistics and transportation. The proposed research will address problems related to CLSCM using an integrated approach for optimal coordination of manufacturing and remanufacturing activities as they may share machines, equipment, labor and other production resources. Current research on such problems is limited and the studied problems are often too simplified to be practical. We plan to follow an integrated approach to develop optimization math models and solution methodology for solving production planning, job scheduling, quality control and improvement and other problems in hybrid manufacturing and remanufacturing systems. Other CLSCM issues including the use of advanced materials such as composite materials, logistics, costs, customer demands and environmental benefits will be incorporated into the extended optimization models. Well-established and advanced modeling tools, optimization methods and computing technology will be utilized to develop effective and efficient solution methods for solving practical CLSCM problems.

"With thousands of genomes being sequenced and even more entering the sequencing pipeline, the next major challenge in the era of genomics is to understand how the genome sequence directs gene expression in living organisms, thereby dictating biology and behavior. My research program has been designed to tackle this challenge directly. In particular, I will take advantage of the genome sequences of closely related species to identify conserved sequence blocks (also known as synteny blocks) and genome rearrangement events. I will focus on the comparative analysis of the genome of a small soil dwelling nematode worm called Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and the genomes of four other Caenorhabditis species: C. briggsae, C. remanei, C. brenneri, and C. japonica. Research on C. elegans has revealed critical secrets of biological processes. Indeed, in the last six years, six scientists have won Nobel prizes for their work using C. elegans as a model system. My research program builds on the assumption that functionally important genome sequence blocks will remain conserved in different species. The genome conservation information will be used to understand gene expression data acquired by sequencing the expressed messages in C. elegans samples. I will examine the correlation of genes within different genome blocks, and their expression profiles in different developmental stages and cell types. Furthermore, I will explore transcriptional regulation of C. elegans genome expression. Working with DAF-19, a conserved transcription factor that can be found in a wide range of  species, I will continue to explore how a gene battery -- a set of genes that are regulated by a common transcription factor -- is regulated, aiming to gain insight into the transcriptional regulation of genes at the genome scale. Specifically, I will investigate the promoter code, the understanding of which will shed light on the identification of target genes and differentiation and development. This program of research brings together methods in bioinformatics, functional genomics, comparative genomics and molecular biology to unravel the secret of genome expression and, in particular, the underlying mechanisms of this biological process.

"Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the developed countries only after heart disease, causing over 70,000 fatalities each year in Canada alone. Presently about 50% cancer patients can be cured, with chemotherapy contributing to cure in 10-15% of the patients. All clinical use of the anticancer drugs involves weighing of benefits against unwanted side-effects. To overcome this bottleneck, targeted drug delivery has been heavily pursued. A new and effective delivery strategy has recently emerged when peptides (small proteins) are used in the design of drug delivery systems. In this application, we propose to develop effective therapeutic delivery technologies using a newly-discovered class of peptides--ionic-complementary, amphiphilic, self-assembling peptides. These peptides not only possess specific drug targeting functions but also derive surfactant-like characteristics, and hence self-assembly capability, from their unique molecular

arrangements (amino acid sequences). Recently, we have demonstrated that these peptides can enclose a model drug and further deliver it into model cells in a controlled manner. Preliminary animal studies have shown our peptide-assisted delivery systems to be safe and efficacious. The three objectives in the current proposal are: a) to develop and optimize formulation of anticancer drugs with self-assembling peptides, b) to demonstrate peptide-mediated delivery of anticancer drugs on biological cells, and c) to evaluate such delivery systems with a mouse tumor model. A success of the proposed research will generate new anticancer drug formulations for chemotherapy, contributing to the health care, cancer treatment in particular, of Canadians. To facilitate the timely translation of our research results into health benefits, appropriate industrial partnership has been

established for joint research and development, and eventual product commercialization.","Produits pharmaceutiques administrables � l'homme","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Ontario,Ontario
"Micro/nanocellular foaming of polymers is an engineering process to create voids or bubbles of microns and nanometers in polymers.  The foamed polymers can save the amount of material for products by up to 50% without compromising their properties, as compared with conventional, un-foamed polymers.  The use of supercritical fluids, CO2 and N2 in this study, is environmentally acceptable, possessing no hazardous or toxic effects.  When the bubble/cell size is made on a nanometer scale, nanocellular polymers are generated, which can exhibit superior structural, mechanical, optical, electrical and corrosion-resistant properties.  Despite numerous advantages of micro/nanocellular foams, the research and development of these polymers are still at their infancy.  The chief reason for not being able to manufacture desired sub-micro or nanocellular foams is the poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the foaming process.  Thus, our short term objectives are to understand the micro/nanocellular foaming mechanisms of polystyrene in supercritical CO2, demonstrate model predictions of lab-scale experiments, and test the optimized protocol in the extruder or injection molding processing.  Our long term objectives are to implement the developed polymer foaming protocol/technology in the industry-scale processing at Mastercore, the industrial partner, and expand the polymer investigated to other commercial polymers, e.g., polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) and polypropylene in supercritical CO2 and N2.  The research outcome will provide necessary processing/materials/system requirements for manufacturing polymer foams of controlled cell size, distribution and density.  This will represent a major breakthrough in producing lightweight, multifunctional micro/nanocellular polymers, which are suitable for a variety of industrial applications.  The resulting technology will allow our industrial partner and Canadian plastics manufacturers to advance their polymer foaming processes, propelling them to the forefront of the international competition in the broader area of plastics processing and manufacturing.

"Surface thermodynamics and adsorption kinetics of small organic molecules, surfactants, polymers and biopolymers are of fundamental importance in various chemical and biomedical engineering systems.  A central property in surface thermodynamics is surface/interfacial tension.  From the behavior of surface tension, one can infer changes in surface chemical composition as well as molecular adsorption.  In the next five years, we will focus our studies on the surface tension of select chemical systems, with three specific objectives: 

1.    )	Surface tension of small, volatile, amphiphilic organic molecules in aqueous solution.  We will develop novel experimental techniques for measuring the surface tension of this class of organic molecules in water.  Our preliminary experiments have shown a set of peculiar behavior that is unexpected from the current theories of surface phenomena, significantly different from those of common small molecule surfactants.  The outcome of this line of research will have significant impact on many emerging nanotechnology advances.

2.    )	Surface tension of polymer melts.  We will develop new experimental methods to measure the surface tension of polymer melts under high pressure and temperature. The surface tension of polystyrene melts in supercritical carbon dioxide will be measured and explained by theoretical modeling based on self-consistent field theory.  The outcome will have direct application in micro/nanocellular foaming of plastics, improving final product morphologies and physical properties.

3.    )	Surface tension and associated properties of self-assembling peptides in aqueous solution.  Many factors influence the behavior of peptide self-assembly, and we will exploit our expertise in surface tension and extract important information about experimental conditions under which the ionic-complementary, amphiphilic peptides self-assemble.  Specifically, important effects of concentration, amino acid sequence and solution pH will be elucidated on peptide nanostructure formation.  The outcome will provide means to control peptide nanostructures for nano-biotechnology applications, especially for drug and gene delivery.

"Ultrafast lasers with pulse widths of a few hundred femtoseconds or less have emerged as powerful tools for research in recent years. They are both the light sources to probe ultrafast processes in photonic materials and components and the tools to develop miniaturized photonic devices with high degree of integration. Understanding the interactions between ultrafast lasers and photonic materials are extremely important for their applications.

The photonic materials to be studied include glasses in the forms of fibre and block as well as organic and polymer materials. The study will focus on the following areas: (1) laser processing of the photonic materials with femtosecond lasers including fabrication of three-dimensional micro-optical structures; (2) understanding of the interactions between femtosecond laser pulses and materials and the mechanisms of changes in their physical properties, including refractive index, birefringence, polarization, and morphology; (3) femtosecond spectroscopy of nano-materials, and (4) microstructures of photonic materials generated or processed by femtosecond lasers for device applications. The knowledge acquired from this research will have potential applications in optical sensing, signal processing, telecommunication and biomedical engineering, and benefit Canadian industries in these fields.

"This strategic project application is to develop, evaluate, and apply an advanced technology for more efficient operation and management of industrial alarm systems.

Industrial accidents often have devastating consequences; moreover, they cost billions of dollars annually in production loss due to unplanned shutdowns, equipment damages, and performance degradations. To meet the desired measures of safety, quality, and efficiency, thousands of variables are constantly monitored in a typical modern industrial plant so that faults and abnormal situations can be promptly detected and appropriate remedies be applied. Detection of a fault usually results in an alarm being raised to inform an operator about the unexpected situation. It takes an operator about 10 minutes on average to process and respond appropriately to an alarm. Therefore, industry standards suggest that an operator should not receive more than six alarms per hour during the normal operation. This is, however, rarely the case in practice as the number of alarms each operator receives is far more than the standard. A majority of these alarms are false and nuisance alarms that

only distract the operator from the operation of the plant and can also mask important alarms.

There exist strong industrial needs and economic benefits for better interpreting and managing the alarms, and redesigning the alarm systems to reduce false and nuisance alarms, and increase the alarm accuracy. This proposal outlines a new research area for complex alarm systems based on digital signal processing and statistic analysis, with research topics ranging from alarm performance measures, alarm signal processing, multivariate alarm analysis and design, automated alarm rationalization, to industrial applications. The tools to be developed have the potential for improving safety in operation and therefore reducing the maintenance costs for the participating partners, as well as various Canadian industrial sectors in general.","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Safety and Security",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Alberta,Alberta
"This strategic project application is to develop, evaluate, and apply an advanced online modeling tool for

electric power grids, for improved monitoring and better operation of large power systems.

The Canadian electric power system is a network of interconnected provincial and territorial subsystems that

have been designed and adapted over time to meet local needs, operating somewhat independently. Such an

energy infrastructure is a blend of existing and new technologies, and is constantly changing and expanding,

because new systems are often added to cope with increasing demand in energy consumption. There are many

challenges in maintaining and operating such power generation and transmission systems, the most prominent

one being lack of an efficient and effective online technology to determine changing grid conditions and

parameters in a timely fashion. This proposal outlines a new research area of developing online (real-time)

modeling tools for electric power grids, based on synchronized phasor measurement units; the research topics

include recursive algorithm development and validation for static and dynamic grid models, and application to

real-time voltage stability analysis (power transfer margin estimation) of large power systems.

Because power grids undergo constant changes in demand and supply, we think the proposed online modeling

tool would be an enabling technology for many wide-area online (real-time) operations such as state estimation,

active monitoring and protection, fault detection and isolation, and stability analysis. The tool to be developed

would provide our industrial partner, and Canadian utility and electric power industries in general, a

technological edge to remain globally competitive, and have a high potential for significant economic benefits

in terms of improved quality and reliability, and reduced cost in electric power delivery.

"With the explosive growth in computing and networking technology, there has been an increasing reliance on distributed process operations based on communication networks. As an example, the power industry is moving towards active monitoring and control through wide-area measurement systems that are accessed over networks; network standards such as Hartbus, Fieldbus, and industrial Ethernet have become commonplace for reliable measurement and distributed control. 



In a networked control system, the system elements are typically spatially isolated from one another, operating in an asynchronous manner and communicating in real time over a wide area via both wired and wireless links. Such networked control systems present new difficulties for control engineers and designers because of the interactions between control and communication components; network imposed constraints such as communication delays, packet dropout, and limited channel capacity must be considered in control analysis and synthesis. A recent expert panel report on future research directions in control (R.M. Murray edited, SIAM Publishing) listed understanding control over communication networks as a major challenge for the field of control. Combining communication constraints and control specifications in networked control systems is the objective and thrust in this research. In the network distributed environment, the proposed research program aims at developing a paradigm for state estimation and prediction based control design, and study their applications in wide-area power systems.



The proposed research program would fill in the gap between theory and practice; it would provide control engineers with new tools for analysis and synthesis of networked control systems; finally, it would establish and strengthen Canada's leading position in this new research area.

"As recently investigated by European technical and Scientific Centre, coin counterfeiting activity continues to increase worldwide. This is reflected by the increasing diversity of counterfeit coins, and sophistication of counterfeit techniques being used as an increasing proportion now approaches the magnetic and electrical characteristics of genuine coins.  Counterfeiting of Canadian coins has also been detected recently in Canada. 



Various new technologies are used for making coins that are more difficult to counterfeit. Typical approaches and solutions include, for example, improvement of coin quality, more complex coin geometry and structure, inserts, surface engineered coins and coins with uncommon electromagnetic properties. 



This proposed research is aimed at developing high secure coins through advanced surface engineering techniques. In particular, the proposed research will develop coins plated with electro-co-deposited metal matrix composite coatings. It is expected that these surface engineered coins would be more secure and have lower risk of fraud because of engineering difficulties in counterfeiting and their unique electromagnetic properties.

"As stated in the Canadian National Program on Generation IV Energy Technologies Research and Development Priorities for 2008-09, the identification of appropriate chemistry and materials for in-core and out-of-core components will be one of the major challenges for the development of the supercritical water reactor (SCWR). Based on available data, there is no single alloy that has currently received enough study to unequivocally ensure its performance in an SCWR. The primary focus of the Canadian effort toward the international development of the SCWR system will be R&D to develop a pressure tube reactor operating at an outlet temperature of up to 625oC. This research proposal addresses the requirement to identify and test new porous insulation materials, which are one of the key components in the design of high efficiency CANDU-SCWR fuel channel.



The proposed research builds on recent new research findings and will explore potential new materials that have never been considered for this purpose before. It is also believed that these new materials could avoid problems that have been identified in existing materials when they are used in SCWR environments. The research will generate new knowledge/technology with a strong potential to strengthen Canada's nuclear industry. The research will be conducted in collaboration with AECL and NRCan. These two leading organizations in Generation IV research and development will contribute directly to the research work defined in the proposal and also provide guidance on the direction of research and coordination with other researchers in the field.

"Near-neutral pH environmentally assisted corrosion (NNPHEAC) represents a substantial cost to Canadian pipeline companies and hence to Canadian consumers. NNPHSCC is controlled from an integrity management point of view by in-line inspection for oil pipelines or by hydrostatic testing for gas pipelines. Either of these techniques provides protection from in-service failures for a number of years and then the process has to be repeated.  The testing cycle is particularly troublesome for gas pipelines since only quite large flaws that fail at hydrotest stress are detected by the hydrostatic testing technique.  These procedures are also enormously expensive.

        The re-inspection interval or re-test interval is currently determined based on empirical models, which are rather imprecise. Recent investigation at the University of Alberta has found that the crack growth behavior of pipeline steels in near-neutral pH environments is consistent with that of true corrosion-fatigue, and crack growth rate da/dN can be correlated with a single mathematical term that is incorporated with all possible measurable variables pertinent to crack growth. In collaboration with engineers from TransCanada Pipelines and Spectra Energy, this project is aimed to achieve the following objectives:

1) To extend crack growth rate models to the growth of small/short/shallow cracks and the growth of cracks by crack coalescence, accounting for environmental, mechanical, and metallurgical effects. 

2) To develop/update predictive pipeline integrity models to include the above crack growth rate models and to incorporate probabilistic variations and all uncertainties in the input data for more reliable predictions.

3) To establish sound scientific basis for various existing practices/methods used in pipeline integrity management including methods for determining re-inspection/re-test intervals, criterion of pipeline steels selections, measures for crack growth control, and prioritization of risk management.

"The objectives of the proposed research are to explore chemical sintering of porous ceramic materials, a process newly developed from our research, and possible engineering applications of the porous ceramics being developed. Ceramics are traditionally sintered under high temperatures and pressures to avoid pores because of their inherently brittle nature. However, an increasing number of applications require porous ceramics. Such applications include for example the filtration of molten metals, high-temperature thermal insulation, support for catalytic reactions, filtration of particulates from diesel engine exhaust gases, and filtration of hot corrosive gases in various industrial processes. The advantages of using porous ceramics in these applications are usually the high melting point, tailored electronic properties, high corrosion, and wear resistance in combination with the features gained by the replacement of solid material by voids in the component. Such features include low thermal mass, low thermal conductivity, controlled permeability, high surface area, low density, high specific strength, and low dielectric constant. This proposed research will focus on a new cost-effective technique recently developed from our research, which involves chemical reactions and phase transformations of oxides and/or carbides, to form macro-porous ceramic structures. Preliminary tests have shown that the porous ceramics has a pore density of about 77% and a narrow pore size range with a mean value at about 1 micrometer. Scope of the research will include the extension of the new technique to form different types of porous ceramics structures and the use of the porous ceramics for various engineering applications.","Efficacit� �nerg�tique","Ressources d'�nergie","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"Many practical complex physical systems, such as internet systems, utility power grids, networked control systems, and sensor network, etc., exhibit a complex structure consisting of many (cooperative) operating units, called nodes, and interconnected (physically or virtually) backbone, called network paths.  The role of network paths is not just in providing link function but actually in the aspect of facilitating the interaction among nodes. The overall system performance is normally not only determined by operation of nodes but also by network path structure, or, in other words, by the interaction among nodes, even if such interaction may be virtual. Accordingly, any optimization of such kind of complex systems should be a strategy that could render both optimal node dynamics and the best choice of all network paths achieving the desired overall system performance.  

 

The proposed research program will take the advantages of rich results developed for complex network structure and for optimal control system to explore cooperative optimization mechanism under the effect of both node dynamics and interaction among nodes.  Apparently, such an optimization, if developed successfully, would be superior amid the argument that, in a complex system, a good network path design would be more efficient to improve overall system performance than node dynamics design. Application of the research results to complex physical systems, such as internet systems, sensor network, and networked control systems, will also be pursued as part of the program.

"Increased dopamine in the brain is believed to contribute to addiction and psychosis, it is therefore important to understand how dopamine output is regulated. Cells that make and release dopamine fire in different temporal patterns, clustered firing in short bursts has been found to be more effective in raising dopamine levels. We have previously reported that the L-type calcium channel is involved in generating this particular firing pattern, now we propose to examine this in more detail using mice that do not have one subtype of the ion channel. The ion channel in question is important for many functions, it is expected that a given subtype may be more implicated in a particular functions involving a specific group of cells in the brain. We will first examine which subtype is important for encoding burst firing to release more dopamine. We further reason that different dopamine cells may have different subtypes of the L-type ion channel that are connected to different parts of the brain. These subtypes will then be involved in regulating dopamine output to different parts of the brain depending on their connectivity. The proposed experiments in this program of research will provide necessary details for us to understand the workings of the brain dopamine system and will also provide clues as to how to target the system in the management of addiction and psychosis.

"One key goal of tissue engineering is to produce 'artificial' organ and tissue substitutes that can grow with patients, ultimately providing a permanent solution to damaged organs or tissues. For this, tissue scaffolds play an important role. A tissue scaffold is a three-dimensional (3D) structure made from biomaterials with highly interconnected pore networks, and is used to facilitate cell growth and transport of nutrients and wastes. Creating these scaffolds has proven challenging due to the difficulty in mimicking the organization of native tissues. In this project, we will develop a method for bio-manufacturing tissue scaffolds, in which living cells are manipulated and added to the scaffolds. Incorporating the method with rapid prototyping, an approach in which a 3D scaffold is manufactured in successive thin layers, we will be able to fabricate scaffolds with spatially controlled distributions of cells and scaffold microstructure. 



This project will lead to the development of new techniques and tools to advance emerging bio-manufacturing of cell-encapsulated scaffolds for wide applications in tissue engineering. This research will foster the convergence of engineering and life sciences, and provide viable manufacturing tools to the biology and life science communities. The outcomes of this research will aid in the development of bio-fabrication product standardizations and the prioritization of future cell-encapsulated products for tissue engineering manufacturing, thereby having broad impacts on technological development, economic growth, and progress towards tissue engineering applications. This research will also involve the training of graduate students to meet the increasing demand for highly qualified personnel in tissue engineering.

"Incorporation of organic materials into soil has significant benefits to the environment, soil fertility, and soil erosion protection. The goal of this research is to develop a unique and universal approach to design soil engaging tools (sweeps, discs, openers, rolling tines, etc.) for efficient incorporation of organic materials (such as livestock manure and crop residue) into soil in agriculture. Problems associated with the existing soil engaging tools include logging of crop residue in conservation tillage systems, high soil disturbance in forage and no-till systems, and high requirement of energy for operations. At a time when world food demand, cost of energy, and environmental impact are a matter of fact, it becomes urgent to rejuvenate soil engaging tools design to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. The performance of a soil engaging tool highly depends on how it interacts with soil and the organic materials they deal with. Currently, the design of commercial soil engaging tools still rely on the traditional soil-tool interaction models on soil behaviour and soil-tool interactions. In most traditional models, the Finite Element Method (FEM) was used and soil is considered as a continuous elastic-plastic media, whereas, soil behaves as a discontinuous media and flows as individual particles (aggregates and clods) around the tool. Thus the FEM is not fully capable to model agricultural soil and soil-tool interactions at the particle levels. Also, the FEM is not able to deal with a mixture of different materials at the ""particles"" levels, such as mixing crop residue ""particles"" with soil ""particles"". These incapacities of FEM have limited soil engaging tool design for ages. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) allows to model soil as an assembly of aggregates/clods and deal with more than one types of particles encountered in material incorporations. Using the DEM in soil dynamics is an emerging field, and this field is at its infancy stage. The proposed research will take a significant step in advancing the field, with the available expertise and research tools in the applicant' lab, the last soil dynamics lab in Canada which is fully functional.

"Multi-hop wireless networking studies a wireless data communcation scheme, where messages are forwarded multiple times over wireless links before reaching the destination for delivery.  Multi-hop wireless networks are a powerful extension to the Internet that will allow it to be a truly ubiquitous infrastructure.  Since the pioneering Packet Radio Network in the 1970's, research on such a networking paradigm has been fruitful.  Not only have different enabling technologies been developed, they are also starting to be integrated to the Internet seamlessly.  Achieving the tangible goal of harnessing the flexibility of such networks with high network operation efficiency is on the horizon.  However, we should not be contented with the fact that multi-hop wireless networks are to be ""as good as"" the Internet. In fact, research on multi-hop wireless has been primarily focused on addressing issues emerging from a networking framework which are more or less deviations of or add-ons to the Internet.  The most fundamental axiom of the Internet data transportation, i.e., packet forwarding among a group of nodes with multiple essentially point-to-point links, has been intact until recently.  This is to be changed by recognizing and embracing the broadcasting nature of wireless communication channels of  multi-hop wireless networks.  Indeed, a wireless link in this case is a limited-scope broadcasting and multiple-access channel at the same time, which is a much more general and potentially more powerful model than the point-to-point channels in the Internet.  Departure from practice and confinement of the Internet is the way to transcend it.  To see further than the Internet giant, we must get onto his shoulders.  The long term objective of the proposed research is to investigate the inherent properties of multi-hop wireless networks in order to overcome disadvantages of such networks induced by translating operating methods from the Internet and to fully unleash their potentials.  It will advance the state-of-the-art data communication, so that we are ever closer to the ultimate goal of ubiquitous computation and information automation.

"Delay differential equations have arisen naturally in many applications such as mathematical ecology, population biology, and neural networks. It is well known that, both in biological and artificial neural networks, delay arises because of the processing of information. Delay differential equations are infinite dimensional dynamical systems and hence are more challenging and interesting to study than ordinary differential equations as delays induce richer dynamics. The purpose of this project is to make significant contributions to the understanding of the local and global dynamics of delay differential equations, especially their global attractors.

"With the advances of CAD/CAM technology, mechanical products with sculptured parts have been widely adopted in the aeronautical, automotive, and dies/molds industries, which always commit to better quality and higher productivity. Since CNC machining generally can make the parts with better quality, less costs, and shorter lead time, it is an important technique in the manufacturing industry. However, as top-notch, high performance 5-axis machining of the sculptured parts is still a great challenge, even though this technique is badly needed. The main reason for this is that some key techniques have not yet been successfully addressed.  The applicant proposes advanced, innovative research on the key techniques, including (i) cutter size optimization for 5-axis sculptured part machining, (ii) NURBS tool path generation to make smooth, accurate surfaces, and (iii) efficient, accurate cutter/workpiece engagement in 5-axis surface milling.



This innovative, applicable research will contribute to the basic understanding and technological advancement of high-performance 5-axis machining of sculptured parts.  It will also contribute to the general knowledge on CAD/CAM and advanced manufacturing, all of which have broad industrial applications.  The techniques developed in this work will be implemented in CAM-Post software and CATIVA V5 for our manufacturing industry and benefit it through improving the efficiency of CNC machining and the quality of diverse sculptured parts; fortunately, this improvement is urgently needed to increase our industrial competitiveness in the on-going globalization.  This research fits a NSERC's mission of advancing our manufacturing industry, and it is complimentary to the present NSERC-sponsored projects of CNC machining.  The research results will be promptly applied to our industrial production through the collaboration with Pratt & Whitney Canada, Bombardier and ICAM.

"The development of Canada's vast oil sands resource has led to increased demands for natural gas to produce steam for bitumen extraction and as a source of hydrogen for bitumen upgrading. However, using increasing volumes of natural gas to process relatively low energy/high carbon resources such as bitumen is costly and not sustainable. Unlocking the full energy potential of coal, in an environmentally responsible process, is key to the ongoing and sustainable development of Canada's oil sands. These benefits transcend the oil sands industry and offer important advantages to a range of other Canadian industries that currently use natural gas as a feedstock or energy source. Canada is ranked tenth worldwide in coal reserves, and Alberta's 33.6 billion tons of coal represents 70% of Canada's total reserves. Consequently, Alberta's coal resources constitute an enormous source of untapped energy. The production of syngas through underground coal gasification (UCG) provides alternatives to the use of natural gas to produce steam and hydrogen for bitumen extraction and upgrading. Furthermore, there may be a great potential for post-UCG CO2 capture and sequestration. The well infrastructure for UCG can be used subsequently for geologic CO2 sequestration operations. UCG is in the early stages of research and development; several key scientific and technical areas, such as UCG process and operation monitoring, combustion and gasification modeling, environmental risk assessment, and feasibility of post-UCG CO2 storage, require extensive research. These areas can be addressed with an accelerated research project. This research project can lever substantially off of existing knowledge and advances in engineering and geo-science simulations.","Ressources d'�nergie (production, exploration, traitement, distribution et utilisation de l'�nergie)","Ressources d'�nergie","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Alberta,Alberta
"Most of the world's petroleum (6 trillion barrels) is heavy oil or oil sands bitumen. Alberta's 174 billion barrels of established oil sands reserves make Canada one of the top two countries globally - along with Saudi Arabia -in terms of proven or economically recoverable crude oil reserves. There are 2.7 billion cubic meters of bitumen locked in Alberta's oil sand. More than 90% of this vast energy source is in deposits too deep underground to be mined at the surface. Thus other methods must be used to coax the molasses-like bitumen, the ""raw"" heavy crude oil, to the surface. 



Enhanced heavy oil and oil sands recovery methods are an intensive research area in the oil industry, and have recently generated a battery of recovery methods in what is the largest growing sector of this industry, such as steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS).  The environmental impacts of these processes and the use of a high volume of water and natural gas suggest that extensive research is required for economic and environmentally friendly development of heavy oil and oil sands reserves. The development of novel recovery technologies for reservoirs with detailed geological description requires advanced solver methods, parallel architectures, fully coupled solution techniques, and methods capable of treating multi-scale phenomena. Also required is a simulator with unstructured grid capabilities to handle adaptive grid refinement to focus the grid to regions of the domain where small-scale phenomena occur. The proposed research will develop mathematical models capable of predicting heavy oil and oil sands reservoir performance under different operating conditions, and design parallel, thermal compositional reservoir simulators and process optimization toolkits suitable for fast, multiple runs that enable risk and uncertainty analysis and decision making in practical timeframes. These simulators will link seamlessly and directly to geological models.

"New RF/microwave radio systems are emerging for innovative wireless technology applications such as asset tracking, environmental sensing and medical monitoring. These radios are often required to be low cost, small size and low power consumption and, at the same time, to have multi-channel and multi-standard functionality, to operate at a high frequency and with a possible wide frequency band. These requirements have always presented difficult challenges for radio designers, since high frequency effects such as parasitics, mutual coupling, radiation and interference can no longer be neglected. 



In addressing the problems, time-domain electromagnetic modelling techniques that can accurately predict radio wave or signal behaviors over a wide frequency bandwidth have been developed and become increasing popular. However, most of these time-domain methods are still constrained by their inherent numerical properties and, therefore, are limited mostly to electrically small structures that are not very useful to real-world problems. The proposed research program is intended to tackle the issue by developing methods and techniques that break with conventional approaches to time-domain modelling.



The methodology to be applied will be based on our recently developed theoretical framework that generalizes numerical time-domain methods. With this theory, novel time-domain methods that require no pre-defined numerical grids but instead employ a set of nodes will be developed. Also, new solution and time-domain diakoptic extraction methods will be developed. Since no other similar techniques have been reported so far, the success of this project will present a new break-through in time-domain simulation and optimization methodologies. The end results will be generic time-domain simulators and optimizers as well as novel devices that can be used for a broad range of emerging wireless technology designs and applications.

"The growing environmental concerns and rapid depletion of fossil fuels have created enormous worldwide demand for alternative, clean energy technologies. Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) have been considered most promising for powering zero-emission electric vehicles, homes/buildings, and portable electronics. Two major technical barriers specifically associated with the PEMFC catalysts are: (i) high cost of Platinum (Pt) and (ii) insufficient durability of currently available Pt based catalysts. Our approach to solving the problems of slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction (ORR), low durability and high Pt content is to design a new class of advanced Pt/Pt-metal/non-Pt nanowires and nanotubes catalysts with controllable size (diameter, length, and nanotube wall thickness), composition (e.g., binary and ternary alloy of Pt and non-precious metals) and structures (core-shell with Pt monolayer/multilayer shell). The ultimate goal of this project is to develop new, inexpensive nanostructured catalysts with excellent stability and enhanced catalytic activity for PEMFCs, and advance our fundamental understanding of catalytic and degradation mechanisms of these catalysts. The proposed approaches and methods in synthesis, processing, computation and optimization of catalysts and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabrication are expected to provide experimental, theoretical, and engineering insights into the nanostructured fuel cell catalysts. The proposed research could bring revolutionary advances to the fuel cell technology by taking advantages of the most recent progresses in nanotechnology. The proposed activity also aims to train highly qualified personnel (HQP) who will be critical in the development of next generation technology in Canada and globally.

"I propose to initiate a research program on investigations of the effects of heteroatoms incorporation on zeolite microstructures and the performance of the resulting materials. The goal of this research program is to establish a solid foundation on how zeolite microstructures and properties would be influenced by the presence of heteroatoms in zeolite frameworks. To approach this, the short-term goals of this research program are: (i) to develop a synthesis protocol to incorporate heteroatoms into zeolite frameworks and (ii) to understand the microstructure variations upon heteroatoms incorporation via detailed characterizations. From this stage, I expect a synthesis protocol would be generated to manipulate zeolite compositions as well as a correlation of microstructure variations with the presence of heteroatoms. The long-term goals of this research program emphasizes on (i) to develop a mechanistic description on zeolite syntheses and (ii) to correlate the microstructure variations from heteroatoms incorporation with the application performances of resulting zeolites. I expect a rationale would be evolved for manipulating the morphology and size of zeolite particles. A guideline for improving the performance of heteroatom-incorporated materials are also anticipated from this study.

   The outcomes of this research program would benefit relevant Canadian industries in (i) design zeolite materials with desired properties with minimal or no trial-and-error efforts, yielding capital savings on man power, materials and time; (ii) develop superior absorbents for applications in environment remediation and create functionalities rationally to accommodate to practical requirements. Meanwhile, HQPs who involve in this research program can establish solid knowledge related with material science, chemical engineering, and catalysis. HQPs can develop experimental skills from zeolite syntheses, operating relevant analytical instruments and performing data analysis.

"Many biomedical imaging applications would greatly benefit from the ability to measure blood vessel function by analysing signal enhancement associated with tissue uptake of an injected contrast agent. Two specific examples from our ongoing research program in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) include: (1) assessment of vessel development in cancer and their response to therapy, and (2) monitoring the growth of blood vessels in engineered or regenerated tissue, which is needed to promote and maintain cell growth. While the focus is geared towards improving health care, these clinical applications rely on appropriate mathematical modeling and signal processing techniques to extract accurate physiological information.



In this project, we propose a new modeling approach to estimate simultaneously and accurately blood flow, blood volume, vessel leakiness, and the space between cells. Identification of these microcirculatory parameters is important, as their alteration is often associated with disease, such as cancer, ischemia, and inflammation. Current models are suboptimal in that they yield only a subset of these parameters, and the reliability of resulting measurements is largely unknown. What is novel in the proposed approach is the ability to measure and maintain accuracy in all four parameters through an estimation process that nests models of increasing complexity. Another original contribution is the full characterization of measurement reliability in current models. Anticipated results are two-fold: (1) an improved ability to assess non-invasively and quantitatively physiological changes associated with disease and treatment, and (2) in a broader sense, a robust mathematical approach to estimating multiple parameters. The results of this research will lend important insight into contrast-enhanced studies across different imaging modalities, including ultrasound and x-ray/CT, with the long-term goals of improving disease detection and management, and developing new treatment paradigms.

"We propose to study problems from two distinct areas of computer science: computer algebra and image processing.



Computer algebra is the study of algorithms which perform mathematical computations symbolically rather than numerically.  Because of its ability to handle symbolic quantities and its lack of numerical errors, computer algebra has many applications in mathematical research, engineering, and mathematical education.  Despite advances in this area, many problems remain impractical to solve.  A common issue encountered in computer algebra is the so-called ""intermediate expression swell.""  In many problems, the size of the input is small but the size of the intermediate results during the calculations can grow significantly.  If this growth is not controlled, an algorithm cannot finish its computation due to time and memory constraints.  The goal in the proposed research in computer algebra is to design and analyze algorithms to control this growth for a variety of problems in computer algebra.  This study will improve our understanding of such problems and provide practical improvements to the current algorithms.



In a separate direction, we propose to study issues related to the storage of large image sets.  We plan to investigate compression methods to reduce storage requirements, as well as encryption algorithms for security.  We are also interested in the interaction among compression, encryption, and efficient image retrieval.  The results from this study  have many applications as the use of large image databases have become more common (e.g. medical and satellite images).

"BUT

Une des missions historiques des g�ophysiciens est de reconna�tre l'existence des ressources naturelles, et de contribuer au d�veloppement �conomique de la soci�t�. L'avantage des m�thodes g�ophysiques est qu'elles sont capables d'envoyer de l'�nergie vers l'int�rieur de la terre, et de faire un diagnostic de la structure en profondeur. Les variations des signaux g�ophysiques dans l'espace et dans le temps sont �troitement li�es aux diff�rentes propri�t�s physiques des zones min�ralis�es et des roches encaissantes. Ceci constitue le lien intrins�que entre la g�ologie souterraine et l'observation g�ophysique. Puisque les donn�es enregistr�es se composent d'une multitude de signaux en provenance de sources profondes et peu profondes, comment d�finir les r�ponses g�ophysiques propres aux diff�rentes sources g�ologiques est un d�fi pour les g�ophysiciens. Au courant des derni�res ann�es, nous avons pu d�velopper une expertise sur l'interpr�tation des donn�es de diverses m�thodes g�ophysiques par la r�alisation d'un projet majeur de recherche: 'Valorisation de la Technologie MEGATEMII' (un syst�me �lectromagn�tique a�roport�), et par l'accomplissement d'un grand nombre de projets de recherche de MRNFQ (Minist�re des Ressources naturelles et de Faune, Qu�bec). Nous poss�dons dix logiciels de mod�lisation dans l'interpr�tation des donn�es g�ophysiques. Depuis 2006, avec l'aide financi�re de FQRNT (�tablissement de Nouveaux Chercheurs), nous avons d�velopp� des nouveaux algorithmes d'interpr�tation afin d'augmenter l'efficacit� de calcul d'un grand nombre de donn�es g�ophysiques, et de r�duire l'incertitude dans l'interpr�tation. Les buts de cette demande financi�re sont:

- aller visiter quelques compagnies canadiennes en exploration de ressources naturelles afin de leur montrer les r�sultats de nos recherches, et de rendre notre service disponible � d'�ventuels besoins;

"Mineral resources are essential for sustainable development of most nations. On the other hand, utilization of resources often causes serious problem threatening human health, ecological and environmental systems in many underdeveloped regions.  It is essential both for mineral exploration and for resource optimum utilization to quantify non-linearity of mineralization processes and to model the spatial distribution of mineral resources . According to the new development of non-linear and complex science and technology, mineralization in the Earth's crust can be considered as nonlinear processes with singular properties that may result in anomalous mass accumulation and element concentration that, generally, are confined to narrow intervals in space. When the ore is mined as resources, the toxic elements in the ore may spread into the surface media around the mine causing environmental problems. Similar to other types of hazardous geo-processes for example earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, flooding, and forest fire, the end products of these non-linear processes have in common that they can be modelled by the new non-linear theories and models of fractals or multifractals. New earth observation technologies and high resolution information have greatly promoted the development of non-linear theory and high-tech geo-informatics technology for modelling the complexity of these singular processes and for mineral resources and environmental comprehensive assessments. The research proposed in this application is devoted to study new non-linear theory, models and GIS techniques for mapping mineral resources and evaluating potential environmental impact. It involves three main objectives: (1) study of new non-linear theory and new methodology for characterizing singularity, generalized self-similarity and self-organized criticality of mineralization processes; (2) study of non-linear methods for geo-information extraction and geo-information integration; and (3) development of advanced GIS technologies for increasing the accuracy of mineral exploration and reduce the costs of exploration and for environmental assessment.

"Internal corrosion is one of the most common reasons resulting in oil/gas pipeline failures. Statistics showed that 54% of Albertan pipeline failures were attributed to internal corrosion in 2002. In particular, internal pitting corrosion is a predominant failure mechanism of pipelines. Owing to the inherent difficulty to detect and design against, the pitting process is extremely insidious. It is mandatory for pipeline operators to avoid these localized failures as they potentially cause major disruptions to many parties and stakeholders.



The overall objective of this research is to develop an accurate prediction, by mechanistically understanding, of internal pitting corrosion of pipelines in oil/gas production, and further to provide recommendations to industry for effective identification and prevention of the associated risks. In this research, both numerical and experimental studies will be conducted to investigate the internal pitting corrosion of pipeline steel in CO2-containing oilfield water system. The finite element method will be utilized to derive the variational formula of all related partial differential equations and the corresponding boundary conditions which describe the chemical-physical phenomena associated with the pit initiation, growth and repassivation. The experimental tests will be carried out to validate the numerical calculations, and determine the parametric effects such as chloride ion concentration, fluid flow velocity, CO2 partial pressure, and temperature on pitting of the steel. The end result will be a predictive methodology and the effective mechanistic model for pipeline vulnerability to internal pitting corrosion, with the capability of identifying, predicting and measuring the associated risks and providing guidance to industry for more reliable integrity management.

"With the continuously growing demand in energy consumption, the exploration of oil and gas from the remote northern area has become an integral part of the energy industry. Development of high-strength steel pipeline technology provides a reliable and economic means for energy transportation. However, the pipeline operation unavoidably encounters severe environmental and technical challenges to maintain its integrity in the North. Corrosion and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) are two major factors to result in pipeline failure.

     The overall objective of the proposed research is to investigate the fundamentals of corrosion and SCC of high-strength pipe steels under conditions that are relevant to the northern pipeline operation. In this research, scanning micro-electrochemical techniques will be used to characterize the localized micro-dissolution event and its transition towards crack in the steel. Criteria will be developed geometrically and electrochemically to identify the critical conditions for a corrosion pit developing into a crack. The effect of coating failure on pitting corrosion and crack initiation will be considered. Furthermore, the dynamic material test system is used to reproduce the complex stress status pipelines may experience in the North. The interactions of stress, hydrogen and anodic dissolution will be determined, and a quantitative prediction of crack growth rate will bedeveloped. It is anticipated that this research will provide recommendations to the pipeline operators for a more reliable integrity management in the North.

     The proposed research contributes to the topic of Leading Innovation in Energy and the Environment, the area of strategic importance to Canada. This research and its contributions to the growth of pipeline engineering research can be expected to impact and provide significant economic, environmental and

energy benefits to Canadian pipeline and energy industries.

"Accumulating evidence indicates that food animals constitute a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes that can be disseminated via live animals, their wastes as well as their meat, and may come into contact with animals, humans and the environment. This dissemination can potentially increase the occurrence of infectious diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria that may be difficult to treat with currently available antibiotics. Studies have shown that human diseases caused by strains of multi-resistant Salmonella enterica and Enterococcus faecium originated from swine herds. Swine production is a major economic activity in Canada that draws billions of dollars in revenue and generates tens of thousands direct and indirect jobs. Food safety and health concerns are being raised regarding the potential impact of antibiotics added to swine feed on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. The objective of this research program is to investigate the impact of antibiotic addition to swine feed on antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria in pigs. The application of complementary molecular biology and microbiology techniques will provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic resistance in swine production. This research program will contribute to forming highly qualified researchers and professionals whom will be able to adequately address microbiological food safety and public health challenged posed by intensive animal rearing.  These researchers and professionals will thus be in a better position to properly informing decision-makers and the public with respect to food safety issues relating to agricultural activities. The knowledge emerging from these research activities will provide science-based evidence for developing meaningful regulations underlying the sustainable management and use of antibiotics in animal rearing in view of prolonging the effectiveness of these drugs, both for animal and human therapy. This is the only way to keep antibiotics as resources for the next generations.

"Advances in video imaging have played a key role in bringing forth the widespread use of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) in a variety of procedures such as cardiology, neurosurgery, orthopaedics, urology and oncology. However, the inherent difficulties of MIS techniques have traditionally imposed limitations on their applicability. Reduced instrumental control and freedom, combined with unusual hand-to-eye coordination and limited view of the operating field, enforce restrictions on the surgeon and require considerable dexterity and skill. On the other hand, these procedures entail several benefits for the patient and the healthcare system: smaller incisions, minimal blood loss, preservation of normal tissue, reduced pain, and shortened recovery and rehabilitation times. 

The overall objective of our research program is to propose an augmented reality environment for Minimally Invasive Computer Assisted Spinal Surgery (MICASS). The challenges involved in realizing this goal are related to the realism of data visualization, the robust reconstruction of patient-specific models and the registration between different imaging modalities. This program will instigate new approaches to ensure accurate registration of patient data from different modalities, which is a prerequisite for intra-operative assistance. 3D preoperative models of the spine obtained from MRI volumetric data and intra-operative X-ray image will be combined with 2D thoracoscopic images acquired during surgery. This multimodal image fusion will provide complementary information including soft tissues and bones in a single view, thus reducing cognitive effort on the part of the surgeon. 

The proposed program will allow us to thoroughly investigate several issues related to the MIS imaging environment, prior to the acceptance of such procedures in clinical applications. Once validated, the MICASS system will not only allow surgeons to work much more accurately and safely with reduced decision making time, but will also enhance the quality of care for patients and reduce the costs to the healthcare system.

"According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), ""Heritage is our legacy from the past, what we live with today, and what we pass on to the future generation."" Since an international treaty was adopted by UNESCO in 1972, an ongoing effort to encourage the identification, protection, and preservation of outstanding heritage around the world has been under way. Particularly those focusing on visual cultural heritage, like ancient documents, have greatly benefited from signal processing (SP) and imaging advances. The task of making such documents legible and accessible is a daunting, but important one, especially when they have great historical significance. These documents may suffer from many forms of deterioration and physical degradation phenomena (background noise, artifacts caused by aging, interfering patterns, and the bleed-through or shadow-through of strokes), they may have been deliberately erased and overwritten, and there may be overlays. The objective of the proposed research program is to define a methodology for the realization of the principal components of a system designed to enhance the content of ancient documents and recover hidden information for the retrieval of digital images of those documents. The proposed methodology will devise a unified image analysis and classification framework. To achieve high-quality restoration, true physical image degradation modeling, which includes stochastic processes, will be developed to model the degradation phenomena. We will then be able to devise efficient reverse diffusion models capable of directly restoring these types of physical diffusion. To achieve high search capability, we will use incremental learning, putting experts (scholars and historians) in the loop to perform data classification and statistical topical class categorization in subspaces, which will reduce the search space and increase system efficiency. Our long-term goal is to build scalable intelligent systems with the human-like ability to seamlessly access and make use of the huge volume and variety of ancient and highly degraded multilingual documents that exists.","Sciences math�matiques","Avancement des connaissances","Computing and Information Sciences - B",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"My current and planned research focuses on outstanding open questions in the area of

approximation algorithms for problems in network design, graph connectivity, and network

flows. These topics occupy a central position in Theoretical Computer Science and Combinatorial Optimization. Moreover, they arise in many practical contexts such as the design of fault-tolerant communication networks. Many of these problems are NP-hard. This means that optimal solutions cannot be computed in a reasonable running time, modulo the conjecture that P is not equal to NP. Hence, research has focused on approximation algorithms, that is, algorithms that run efficiently (in polynomial time) and find solutions that are within a guaranteed factor of the optimal solution.



I have attacked some of the outstanding open topics in the area (jointly with co-authors),

and we have achieved substantial advances. The problem of designing networks that

satisfy vertex connectivity requirements is a hot topic. Together with Vetta, I have

given constant-factor approximation algorithms for some key special cases of practical importance, for example, metric-cost subset k-connectivity. Another topic of high interest pertains to packing Steiner trees in a given graph. Together with Salavatipour, I have obtained both approximation algorithms and hardness results that serve to classify the tractability of the different problems (models); these results have implications for network coding, which is an exciting emerging area of practical and theoretical significance.



My current and future research focuses on these topics, and the high-level goal is to achieve algorithmic advances and to obtain a better understanding of  the fundamental issues.

"As the Internet grows in scale, it faces an increasingly adverse environment that the original design did not envision. Faults have become the norm rather than the exception, due to component failures, human operational errors, spreads of software viruses, and malicious attacks. In this environment, automated network management techniques, including autonomic, self-configuring and self-optimizing devices and systems as well as self-protecting and self-healing architectures will become increasingly important.

The research will focus on the developing the architecture of the configuration module for autonomic networks. The configuration module, - the core capability of an autonomic network -, will be designed to translate the commands and the files or records into abstract structures, does the configuration, adds or activates services according to policy-based goals using the rules of composition provided by the abstract structures and reconvert the configuration result into commands and configuration files. These features are not available today and are merely implemented in form of text-only commands and files. The configuration information including services, policies, functional and version features will be represented by structured tree-like topologies called ""constructs"" that can be manipulated using a specific algebra with formal composition operations.

Our methodology consists first in extending the mathematical model based on configuration logic and formal orchestration constraints enabling the verification of the configuration information through the manipulation of the algebra. We will also use performance simulation to analyze different self-configuration scenarios to assess the self-optimizing, self-healing and self-protecting capabilities. The performance analysis will determine the impacts for various autonomic configuration scenarios. Finally, we plan to experiment with autonomic network implementations and demonstrate its applicability in future systems.

"Further improvements to composite materials for use in high voltage applications using micron size fillers are not likely, as mixing of the viscous compositions has reached the limitation of current material processing technology.  However, initial findings of nano-size particle (nanoparticle) filled dielectrics show similar improvements to materials at considerably reduced filler additions; thereby, the promise of further improvements to dielectric materials are likely with the existing processing technology.  Most researchers agree that the problem with nanoparticles in organic materials (nanocomposites) is the dispersion of particles and uniform mixing is critical in the development of nanocomposites.  One of the problems is that the nanoparticles agglomerate easily because of the high surface energy of the particles and conventional mixing techniques do not break apart the nanoparticle agglomerates.  Another problem is the incompatibility of the hydrophobic polymer with hydrophilic nanoparticles, resulting in poor interfacial interactions.  Thus, there is a great need to discover alternative ways to obtain a better dispersion of the nanoparticles. The reseach focuses on the surface modification of the nanoparticles by physical and chemical methods using surfactants.  Although surfactants are commonly applied to liquids, their application to disperse nanoparticles in compositions forming solid dielectric materials has not yet been reported.  The main advantage of using a surfactant is that it lowers the surface and interfacial tensions of the nanoparticles resulting in reduced agglomeration and makes it easier to disperse the particles.  Preliminary findings have shown that triton, a common surfactant, aids in the dispersion of nanosilica and nanoalumina in silicone rubber.  The research will concentrate on the understanding of how surfactants can improve the properties of nanodielectrics and which composite systems are appropriate to optimize the dielectric properties of these composites for high voltage electrical insulation.

"The main goal of the proposal is to study geometric properites of algebraic groups. Recall that the mathematical objects that measure symmetry are called ``groups'' and their study is known as ``group theory''. Classical examples of groups are those of rotations or translations (continuous groups) and the symmetry of a square or a snowflake (discrete groups).



Algebraic groups were invented in 20th century with the aim to combine both discrete and continuous structures. Their origins go back the fundamental work of Weil, Chevalley, Borel, Serre and Springer who, in the 1940s and 50s, systematically developed the ideas of Lie and Cartan in the context of algebraic geometry. Over the course of subsequent decades the theory of algebraic groups has been used to give a unified treatment of several key areas of algebra, including the theories of quadratic forms, central simple algebras, algebras with involution and some non-associative algebras. 



Given an algebraic group one can associate different geometric objects. Of special interest are torsors and projective homogeneous varieties. Recent results on the Brauer groups show that future progress in this area of mathematics depends how deeply we can understand geometry of these spaces. My project concerns on understanding splitting properties of projective homogeneous varieties. Loosely speaking we concentrate on the problem of parametrizing their points and splitting fields. As applications we plan to solve a number of long-standing conjectures in the theory of algebraic groups. Homological methods and machinery of algebraic K-theory will play a prominent role in this research effort.

"Contamination of aquifers is an increasing problem globally and in many regions. The degree and timing of the contamination is governed by the characteristics of the aquitard (low permeability layer) that overlies the aquifer.  Aquitard integrity refers to the capability of the aquitard to protect the underlying aquitard from contamination. This research has two goals: the first is to develop a new method for determining aquitard integrity by acquiring information from a single drill hole at each study location, and the second is to apply this method in an investigation of two important clayey aquitards: one located in southwestern Ontario and the other in Winnipeg.  The new method involves a combination of four activities: rotosonic drilling, installation of a new type of monitoring device in the rotosonic holes, squeezing of porewater from the rotosonic cores, and the use of x-radiography of cores.  Much information can be obtained from the same hole because of recent advances in drilling / coring technology and advances in multilevel monitoring technology.  The three main data types are detailed hydraulic head profiles, environmental isotopes (i.e. tritium, 18O, 2H, carbon-14) and X-radiography of aquitard cores. X-radiography is a technique that has existed for many decades but it has been little used in studies of aquitard integrity and I believe it will add much value.  Other more conventional data will also be obtained from the holes, however the major new insights and overall value concerning aquitard integrity are expected to come from the above- mentioned combination. Rotosonic drilling provides large-diameter core at reasonable cost in essentially all types of nonindurated deposits and the core holes are easily used for installation of multilevel monitoring systems for head profiles. Also, the cores provide water by squeezing for isotope and other analyses.

"Gait analysis aims to quantify and assess the mechanics of normal and abnormal movement patterns during walking. Biomechanists use state of the art motion capture systems to record gait patterns and describe the mechanics of movement. Gait data provides many challenges to researchers as it consists of vast numbers of waveforms that are difficult to analyze and compare. An accepted method of gait curve comparison has not been developed. As a result, many researchers extract discrete points (peaks) from the waveforms and ignore the valuable temporal information and patterns of motion. Numerical tools that classify and compare gait patterns based on the entire waveform are needed.  This study aims to further my work on the design and implementation of algorithms that reduce the vast quantities of mechanical data to a series of one-dimensional indices of normality based on age-matched normative data. The indices, or classifiers, use an automatic system (motion capture and subsequent data analysis) to detect movement abnormalities based on magnitude, pattern of motion, and correlations between gait curves. The output is a series of numerical scores that make mechanical and physiological sense and yield interpretable results. Very few classifiers exist that can satisfy the two-fold constraint of incorporating correlated multi-dimensional input data and providing readily interpretable output. The proposed work is novel in that it incorporates mechanical data, myoelectric signals, and functional measures. To date, no other classifiers include all of these measures, which are considered integral to a typical gait analysis. The development of the classifier will provide researchers with an automated tool to reduce mechanical and myoelectric data and quantify differences in gait waveforms. This will lead to a greater understanding of the differences in gait patterns between populations or individuals.

"Over the past decade, in addition to high ambient temperatures, a high body temperature has become recognized as a major direct cause of decreased voluntary exercise capacity and tolerance. However, the mechanism by which body temperature influences exercise capacity remains a major source of debate. A number of studies have suggested that the achievement of a critically high body temperature directly causes fatigue during voluntary, whole-body exercise. Alternately, other studies have proposed that, in advance of the point of catastrophic collapse, the human organism alters its workload on an anticipatory basis by integrating temperature and other inputs, such that the exercise can be completed as efficiently as possible while minimizing the risk of heat exhaustion and collapse. These two models have often been pitted against each other as contradictory. However, another perspective may be that the two models are actually complementary and not necessary exclusive of each other, but arose as a by-product of different research approaches. Therefore, the objectives of this research program are to determine whether the two models can indeed co-exist and the relative contribution of central and regional peripheral thermal afferents to neuromuscular function. The themes and primary objectives of the proposed research program include:

1.    )	understanding how peripheral and regional temperature interact with central core temperature to influence muscle activation and force production and control, and determining the relative influence of core and skin temperature on neuromuscular function and exercise capacity.

2.    )	understanding the mechanisms underlying the apparently differing effects of core and peripheral temperature across different types of maximal exercise, ranging from brief, all-out contractions of a single muscle through to voluntary, whole-body exercise.

"This research will use a new imaging technique called MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) to measure brain activity non-invasively in humans while they perform a simple and repetitive motor task over long periods of time (e.g., pressing a button when they see a number appear on a screen, unless it is the number ""3"").  The goal of this research is to study how the natural waxing and waning of our attention over time affects our ability to perform these tasks and what brain areas are involved.  In particular, we wish to identify those areas of the brain that detect when we make an error (such as accidentally pressing the button for the number 3).  This will increase our knowledge of which brain structures are important in preventing or detecting errors due to ""mind wandering"" or inattention in real world situations, such as driving an automobile or work-related activity involving repetitive tasks.  This will have important applications to the understanding of motor control, as well as attentional deficits in individuals reflected by poor performance in such tasks, for example, in patients with mild head injuries, or children with attentional disorders.

"CO2 is a common component of fluids in the earth's crust. It is generally much less abundant than H2O, but in some geologic environments including mineral deposits, it may be enriched and become more important than H2O. Certain types of mineralization, particularly gold deposits formed in mountain-building processes (called orogenic type gold deposits), are almost always associated with CO2-enriched fluids. The nature of such metal-CO2 association is not well understood because CO2 is not a good metal-transporting agent. CO2-enriched fluids have also been found in other mineral deposits, including rare metals (Sn, W) and base metals (Cu, Zn, Pb) deposits. In the proposed research, we tackle the metal-CO2 association problem by studying fluid inclusions from two large mining camps, the Red Lake gold district (western Ontario) and the Lanping base metal district (Yunnan Province, China). Fluid inclusions are tiny (a few microns) droplets of fluids entrapped in minerals and represent ancient fluids related to mineralization. The fluid inclusions in the world-class Campbell-Red Lake gold deposit are special because they are mainly composed of CO2, with no detectable H2O. The superlarge Jinding Zn-Pb deposit in the Lanping district also contains CO2-dominated fluid inclusions. The H2O-poor, CO2-dominated fluids are believed to be responsible for the transport of large amounts of gold and zinc in the formation of the Campbell-Red Lake and Jinding deposits, respectively. We plan to carry out detailed geochemical studies of the CO2-dominated fluid inclusions with an aim to unravel the mechanism of the association between CO2 and gold and some base metal deposits. The study involve measurements of volatiles and solutes in the fluid inclusions using various analytical techniques. High pressure - high temperature experiments will be done to evaluate how gold and base metals were transported in CO2-dominated fluids. The research results will contribute to mineralization theories, which can help mineral exploration.","Sciences de la terre","Avancement des connaissances","Solid Earth Sciences",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan

"Localized, controlled drug release has gained clinical relevance in treating proliferative diseases in the past decade. The rapidly proliferating cells can keep systemic antiproliferative drugs from entering the capillary networks in the tissue. As a result, many proliferative diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy do not respond well to systemic drug administration. State-of-the-art

polymeric-based drug delivery systems can be intraocularly injected to provide localized treatment but does not provide exact dose and temporal control.

Antiproliferative drugs such as doxorubicine and antisense oligonucleotides have been shown to be promising

in treating proliferative diseases. However, the low cellular uptake of the drugs keeps them from being fully

successful. This proposal responds

to the need for an engineering device that provides controlled and highly efficient delivery of drugs. The

primary goal in this exploratory stage is to develop and demonstrate a

micro-electro-mechanical

systems (MEMS) based drug delivery device that (1) controls the release of drugs

from the micro device and (2) increases the cell uptake of the agents using an on-chip ultrasound actuator.

"The long-term goal of the proposed program is to continue Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) research in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UBC.



The proposed research aims to provide a solution for one of the obstacles in implantable biomedical devices- ""biofouling"". The immune reaction begins by forming a thin protein layer on the device surface immediately after implantation. If the device is a sensor, the protein layer would obstruct physiological entities of interests (such as glucose) from getting into the device and the sensitivities of the sensor would reduce chronically and eventually ""blinded"" by the fibrosis encapsulation. Conventional anti-biofouling approaches often involve biocompatible polymer coatings on the device surface, however, the success has been limited and no perfect coating exists. From the support of a previous Discovery grant, we have demonstrated micromachined piezoelectric actuators can reduce protein adsorption, the first step to prevent formation of a biofouling layer. We discovered that combined mechanical and electrostatic effects on a piezoelectric material surface are responsible for the protein desorption. The demonstrated mechanism may be used without or in combination with existing polymer coatings. One of the aims of this proposal is to apply the discovery to make anti-biofouling sensors. We will implement piezoelectric materials such as poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) on biomedical devices using micromachining techniques. The second aim of this program is to apply protein-MEMS interaction mechanisms to microfluidic device-based protein separation and detection. We propose a new 1-D separation based on pressure-driven microfluidic channels.

"The nutritive and health benefits of legumes, which include peas, lentils, chickpeas and beans, in the human diet are well known.  Demand for these pulse crops is increasing and they have become a major growth area in Canadian agriculture, especially in Saskatchewan. While the largest profit margins exist in crops directed towards human consumption, significant markets also exist in animal feed.  With increased awareness of global warming, there is increased interest in the beneficial environmental impact of using legume crop rotation to increase the nitrogen content of soil, thereby reducing the use of chemical fertilizers.  In order to remain competitive in these markets, it is paramount to be able to meet changing consumer demands.  One area for improving the quality of legumes lies in the fact that they can cause flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other mono-gastric animals.  This is due to the relatively high levels of the raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs) found in legumes. The major obstacles in identifying varieties of legumes that address this matter lie in two major areas.  One is the lack of understanding how gene expression and carbohydrate seed content are related.  The other is the time and resources required to test new varieties for the desired traits. The research described in this proposal will develop a platform capable of relating the seed composition (protein, lipid and carbohydrate content) of different lentil and chickpea varieties to their genetic composition.  The goal is to develop targeted DNA-based molecular markers and genome maps to screen germplasm and expedite breeding for specific traits using marker assisted selection.

"Plants have the unique capability to capture light energy and use it to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, which in cereal crops are present in the grain.   Thus, cereal grains are the major source of calories in human diet and animal feed.  Carbohydrates exhibit considerable structural diversity and relatively small changes can alter their functional properties and uses.  For example, a change in starch structure alters its digestibility in human and animal stomach.  This altered starch, referred to as resistant starch, can result in reduction in the amount of calories available from grain-based products, thus making grain products suitable for diabetics.  Furthermore, since it is broken down by bacteria in the colon, it may contribute to lowering the risk of colon cancer.  The proposed research will improve our basic understanding of starch biosynthesis and enable development of molecular strategies to produce wheat and barley lines with unique starch profiles.  This will help Canadian producers to capture niche markets and help them to stay competitive in the global market place. In addition, food products made with wheat and barley with altered starch profiles can also help in disease prevention such as obesity and colon cancer and it has the potential to reduce health care costs.","Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","Plant Biology & Food Science",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Saskatchewan,Saskatchewan

"New developments in concrete technology have resulted in changes in the types of concrete used in civil engineering applications as well as the performance requirements.  Use of new cements and new mineral and chemical admixtures have led to the development of high performance concrete (HPC) and self-consolidating concrete (SCC).  HPC and SCC present numerous advantages such as high strength, high elastic modulus, less bleeding, less creep, and high durability.  For example SCC is a highly flowable concrete that can spread easily and self consolidate under its own weight without segregation.  Stricter performance requirements, mainly durability, have also been imposed on these concrete to ensure longevity.  At present, standard test methods have not been developed to ensure quality of the fresh concrete and its compliance with the durability and other structural requirements.  

Quality of fresh concrete can be characterized by its homogeneity, and the ease, with which it can be mixed, transported, compacted and finished. Rheology, which is defined as the science of deformation and flow of matter with time, provides the material properties for controlling the quality of concrete. At present, concrete rheology continues to be qualitatively characterized by terms such as workability, flowability, compactability, stability, finishability, pumpability, and consistency, without a proper reference to fundamental measurements of properties. To overcome these inadequacies, a fundamental and quantitative approach is proposed to adequately describe the flow of fresh concrete.  Moreover, by proposing to establish links between rheological properties, concrete processing and properties of hardened concrete, a holistic concrete mix design can be developed for controlling the quality of fresh concrete, optimising concrete composition for different processes and improving its durability.  These developments will enhance the economic viability of concrete, will reduce waste and conserve natural resources, all leading to sustainable concrete infrastructure.","Performance des mat�riaux","Construction, urbanisme et am�nagement rural","Civil Engineering",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"The computers in use today are based on a notion of information rooted in classical physics.  They represent data using bits, each bit taking the value 0 or 1.  But quantum mechanics, the physical theory describing the behavior of atoms at a fundamental level, offers a more general notion of information.  In quantum mechanics, data can take on a superposition of its possible classical values.  To take advantage of this new kind of information, we can envision constructing a quantum mechanical computer, an information processing machine that operates according to the laws of quantum mechanics.

     It turns out that quantum computers can quickly perform certain tasks that seem to be intractable for classical computers.  For example, there is an efficient quantum algorithm for decomposing an integer into its prime factors.  No such algorithm is known for classical computers, and indeed, many of the cryptosystems in use today (for example, to encrypt financial transactions carried out over the internet) are based on the widely-held assumption that this problem is hard.  Thus, quantum computers overturn established notions of what can be computed efficiently, with potentially dramatic implications for technology.  However, only a few examples of quantum speedup are known, and the nature of the computational advantage provided by quantum mechanics is currently poorly understood.

     My research program is focused on better understanding the power of quantum computers.  Specifically, I work to develop new quantum algorithms that achieve dramatic speedup over classical  computation.  This research serves both to illuminate the differences between classical and quantum computers and to find quantum solutions for problems of practical importance, such as search problems and cryptographic tasks.  I am especially interested in developing novel algorithmic techniques for quantum computation, expanding the toolbox of methods that can be used to design and analyze new quantum algorithms.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Computing and Information Sciences - B",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"We are requesting funds to obtain two Mini Mass Embryo Production Systems.

The systems will be used to raise large numbers of adult zebrafish, and to obtain large numbers of eggs for genetic analysis. This system will augment our existing fish housing system which is fully utilized and currently is limited in the ability to produce enough zebrafish embryos for our own use, in addition to embryos for collaborators and for undergraduate research. There will be an ongoing need increase zebrafish housing as an increasing number of researchers at the University of Calgary are interested in using this powerful model in their own research.

"There is a lack of knowledge regarding the evolutionary ecology of vector-borne diseases, that is, the ecological and historical interactions, and changes in the population genetic structure of the three groups of organisms that make up an 'epidemiological triangle'; vectors (e.g. mosquitoes & ticks), hosts (vertebrates), and pathogens (e.g., bacteria & viruses) transmitted by vectors to hosts. Ticks are the most important reservoirs and vectors of human infectious diseases in North America, and they are responsible for transmitting pathogenic agents to domestic animals and wildlife. There are over 30 tick species that occur in Canada, yet for many species, we know very little of the types (i.e. species and strains) of bacteria they contain. Over the next 5 years, graduate and undergraduate students in my research group will conduct innovative and exciting research projects on the population genetics and coevolution of organisms in epidemiological triangles, in which the vectors are different species of tick that differ in their life cycles, types of hosts used and/or their relative host specificity. Molecular techniques will be used to quantify the population genetics of ticks, bacteria and small mammals for multiple genetic markers. Spatial and temporal changes in the genetic structure of tick populations and of different bacterial strains will also be explored. Detailed knowledge of the population genetics and coevolutionary relationships of ticks, their bacteria and hosts, permits an understanding of anomalies in the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, which might otherwise go explained. Our findings will provide key insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors influencing the population genetic structure of epidemiological triangles, and provide critical information for the construction of ecological epidemiological models of microbial transmission and the population dynamics of vector-borne diseases. Such work is also of importance because some tick species are expanding their geographical ranges in Canada, which poses an increased threat to human and animal health.

"We have recently developed a highly efficient and unified process for making a wide variety of chiral vicinal diamines in enantiomerically pure form. In this approach, diaza-Cope rearrangement (DCR) reaction is used for making C2 symmetric and unsymmetric aryl and alkyl substituted vicinal diamines in a 'one pot' reaction from the 'mother' or 'master' diamine. This represents a powerful new platform from which to develop stereoselective catalysts and drugs and is of both academic (ref 1) and commercial (ref 2) interest. Researchers world-wide have used chiral vicinal diamines in creative ways to develop innovative

organocatalysts as well as transition metal based catalysts. Some of the diamine based stereoselective catalysts developed to date include reduction catalysts, oxidation catalysts, and hydrolysis catalysts. They have also been

shown to catalyze a variety of carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. Many of our diamines prepared from the DCR method are now readily available through commercial sources for electronic and steric tuning of known stereoselective catalysts. New chiral vicinal diamines will be designed and synthesized by the DCR method for our research projects. These diamines will be used for making novel receptors, sensors, organocatalysts and transition metal based catalysts. Of particular interest in our group is developing chiral receptors, sensors, and catalysts for separating, sensing and making natural and unnatural amino acids that are useful in the development of drugs. DFT computation will be used in designing diamine based compounds that bind tightly and selectively to the target molecules or transition states. In addition, there is considerable potential for using the DCR method for making therapeutic agents. References

"We propose to efficiently generate Tera-Hertz (THz) pulses using a new technique developed in the applicant's

laboratory. It is based upon the phenomenon of self-focusing of intense femtosecond (one millionth of a

trillionth of a second) laser pulses in air. After self-focusing, the pulse will self-transform into a long streak of

sharp foci. We call the latter a filament. A laser pulse propagating inside the filament of the intense

femtosecond laser pulse will be locked on to the latter so that they propagate together and produce a new

electromagnetic pulse through a physical process called four-wave-mixing. This latter technique can produce

electromagnetic pulses whose frequencies could range from the UV to the radio frequency. The applicant and

co-workers have demonstrated the feasibility of this technique in the visible region. A patent on this new

technique is being filed. This project proposes to focus on generating THz pulses using the same technique.

The current partner, Defense Research and Development of Canada in Valcartier, is in urgent need of a new

technique to generate such pulses at short and long ranges to detect chemical and biological agents such as

anthrax and explosives for the obvious reason of security. The proposed project would generate new

knowledge and technology and increase the number of highly qualified personnel in the areas of ultrafast laser

technology.

"The applicant proposes to push forward a frontier in ultrafast intense laser science which he has contributed significantly in its development in the past few years, namely, filamentation nonlinear optics and remote sensing. He will develop a new femtosecond (one millionth of a trillionth of a second) laser technology to detect atmospheric pollutants related to environment and security. It is based upon the phenomenon of self-focusing and filamentation. He will use the LIDAR (laser radar) technique to remotely detect the fluorescence of pollutant molecules fragmented inside the so-called filament of intense femtosecond laser pulses. The uniqueness of this technique as compared to using other long laser pulses is that one can project the femtosecond laser pulse to remote distances up to a few km at high intensity which will induce finger print fluorescence from pollutant molecules. Using only one laser one would be able to identify the existence of most chemical and biological agents.  The applicant will also study an emerging field of laser science which he helps develop; he calls this 'filamentation nonlinear optics'. He proposes to study the science and technology for the generation of high quality, very short (a few cycle of oscillation of the electromagnetic field) pulses through the so-called 'four-wave-mixing' inside the filament. The nonlinear physical processes of inducing the fluorescence from the fragmented pollutant molecules inside the filament will also be studied. The proposed project would generate new knowledge in the science and technology of the field of ultrafast intense laser science and contribute to the training of a good number of highly qualified personnel. It is expected that the technology of remotely sensing chem.-bio pollutants will be developed within less than five years if the necessary funding is secured.

"Flow Accelerated Corrosion (FAC) is a serious safety and reliability problem facing aging power generation plants, especially nuclear power plants. This phenomenon results in the wear of large areas of piping that can lead to sudden and catastrophic failure. There are two mechanisms responsible for FAC: (i) an electrochemical phenomenon which depends on the chemical properties of the working fluid, and (ii) erosion of metal due to the relative motion of the working fluid and the metal surface. The objective of the proposed project is to investigate flow accelerated corrosion (FAC) in piping components. In particular, the hydrodynamic effects of single and two phase flow on FAC in two 90-degree elbows arranged back-to-back will be evaluated under a range of flow conditions. This configuration was chosen because elbows have been identified as most prone to FAC through on-line monitoring of piping systems in most power plants. Experiments will be performed for different back-to-back elbow separation distances and elbow arrangements for a range of inlet flow velocities and two-phase flow regimes. Both the flow and wear rates in the elbows will be characterized to elicit the principal flow mechanisms responsible for FAC. The project will be performed in collaboration with Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL). The results from this research project will provide information that can be used for better management of on-line monitoring of nulcear power plants for FAC by identifying the flow conditions and piping configurations that are most prone to FAC. It is envisaged by both partners that this project will be the start of a more comprehensive reserach program to better understand FAC in NPP that will lead to enhanced safety, reliability and economics of nuclear power plants.

"Gas-liquid two-phase flows are important in a number of engineering applications. For example, the safety analysis codes for the nuclear energy industry require closure relations for the vapor-liquid interfacial transfer terms, while accurate two phase pressure drop models are necessary to design the piping systems in the oil and gas industry. In these and other applications, the two phase flow can occur in complex piping geometries such as sudden area changes, orifices, bends and valves under a variety of flow conditions. Thus, it is important to understand the effect of different piping components on the two phase flow, especially in the developing regions downstream of these components, to develop reliable mechanistic models. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the flow and liquid turbulence structure of developing two-phase flows. In particular, the developing flow downstream of piping components and in the entrance regions will be investigated. The flow and turbulence structure of the two phase flows will be investigated using an existing 1.5-inch diameter horizontal air-water flow loop and a 8-inch vertical air-water flow loop. The local void distribution will be measured using capacitance and optical probes, while the liquid velocity and turbulence will be measured using hot film anemometry.  A four-point optical probe will be used to determine the change in the bubble shape and size due to bubble coalescence/break-up. A high speed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system will be adapted to measure the liquid turbulence field around the bubbles. There are few studies, especially of the flow and turbulence structure in the developing region of two-phase flows.  However, this region is important in many multiphase systems and plays a determining role in many engineering applications. The measurements that will be performed here will be unique and provide physical insight into this complex phenomena and provide input to develop mechanistic models that can be incorporated into different engineering applications.

"I have been interested in the origin and evolution of polyploids. My research has largely focused on the Stellaria longipes complex (Caryophyllaceae). S. longipes is a polyploid and essentially a North American taxon. It is widely distributed on the continent, but also extends into parts of Eurasia, there by attaining a circumpolar distribution. It grows in a variety of habitats, is extremely plastic and a highly successful colonizer. I am attempting to understand the evolutionary strategies of this species. Our work since 1979 points out two important aspects of the biology of the species which contributed towards its success.  A) Genetic variability due to polyploidy, facultative outbreeding and interspecific gene flow. B) Development of phenotypic plasticity due to environmentally induced changes in the physiology and morphological expression of the genotypes. My laboratory is currently involved in the continued studies of 1) origin and diversification of the species, and 2) understanding the genetic mechanisms and the adaptive significance of phenotypic plasticity in this species. The idea that biologists need to work downward from phenotypic variation to the physiological effects of genetic and environmental variation is now well recognized. My research program is essentially a 'collaborative' interaction between population biology, ecophysiology, molecular biology and biosystematics. Blending among these disciplines has been a promising endeavor to my understanding of the evolution of this widely distributed extremely plastic and highly successful herbaceous perennial plant species.

Seven projects are proposed for the next grant period.

1) Origin of polyploid Stellaria longipes. 2) Molecular evolution in the species complex. 3) DNA methylation and its role in phenotypic plasticity. 4) Regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and it role in stem elongation plasticity.  5) Light induced adaptive growth response: molecular mechanisms underlying cell wall extensibility leading to growth. 6) Genetic differentiation and reproductive biology of populations along an elevational gradient 7) Write a monograph on Stellaria longipes.

"Optimization is an integral part of the information technology revolution.  Better decisions have to be made faster, over much larger and more complex models and data sets. Computer-based optimization techniques and software are fundamental tools that are very widely applied in this context.  Examples include online pricing and reservations systems for airlines, inventory control for manufacturing, and radiation treatment planning and cancer diagnosis systems for health applications.  The objective of the proposed research is to improve the algorithmic tools for optimization and their subsequent software implementations.  Main thrusts include improved algorithms for faster solution of certain difficult problems, better tools for constructing and verifying complex models, and exploration of some novel applications for the new techniques. The expected output is prototype computer implementations of tools that can be used and evaluated by practitioners.

"Genetics and Molecular Biology of Morphogenesis: 

After fertilization the egg starts to divide to form a ball of cells. How does this ball of cells form into a worm, fly or even a human being? This fascinating developmental process is called morphogenesis-the change in shape and form.  Our knowledge about the genetic and molecular control of morphogenesis is lacking when compared to other developmental processes such as cell division and pattern formation.  The Chin-Sang lab's goal is to understand the molecules that regulate the behaviour of cells as they change their shape and migrate to different locations to generate their three-dimensional form of an organism. The Chin-Sang lab uses the genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to study simple examples of cell shape changes and movements.  C. elegans is a microscopic worm and an excellent model system to study morphogenesis. Dr. Chin-Sang's proposed methods are tried and proven techniques, exemplified by two recent Nobel Prizes that used C. elegans methods similar to his proposal. Dr. Chin-Sang has developed a sensitive genetic screening protocol to identify genes that are required for cell movements during morphogenesis. These genes will be cloned and characterized using genetic, molecular biology and biochemical techniques.  His proposal is novel as his screening protocol has increased sensitivity which will allow him to identify genes that would have been missed in past screens. His proposal will directly benefit at least 3 graduate students and several undergraduate students.  The results obtained will contribute to the basic scientific knowledge of cell biology which has a wide variety of academic and industrial applications in the Canada. His proposal will ensure that leading edge training and knowledge is available for future highly qualified personnel in his research program.

"Evolutionary Biology is undergoing radical transformation as its embrace extends ever further into the workings of the organism, the cell, and the genome. More and more, the genome appears to be not simply a well-ordered blueprint but a noisy 'parliament' of interacting genes. My research team studies the origins and nature of genetic variation using original and powerful techniques in the ordinary fruit fly, Drosophila. Our research has shown that levels of genetic variation related to survival and lifetime reproductive success are surprisingly high, given that these are the very components of Darwinian fitness. The proposed research uses special cloning methods to quantify three distinct sources of variation: spontaneous mutation, gene-gene interactions, and sexually antagonistic genes. First, we will suspend natural selection across the entire genome, allowing mutations to accumulate unchecked over many generations. Preliminary results show that mutations manifest themselves quickly, and the same mutations have a much more severe impact on males than females. Experiments will measure genetic variation in fitness over the full lifespan of the fly. We will characterize growth, reproduction, ageing and death in our lines, and investigate the controversial phenomenon of 'plateaus in senescence', in which ageing appears to stop late in life. Next, we will break apart the cloned genomes and assemble new mixtures to study the degree to which genes add together in effect or interact synergistically. Finally, in all experiments, we will measure the consistency of genetic effects in the two sexes and analyze for sexually antagonistic genes. Our research has implicated SA genes in reducing the average fitness of both females and males. This research is modular and scalable, facilitating the training of expert personnel at every level. It explores fundamental questions in evolutionary genetics, and ultimately provides insight into problems as diverse as genetic diseases, infertility, and senescence. By showing how fitness is governed in bottled flies, we hope to illuminate the workings of other genomes, notably our own, and shape understanding of a central question in Biology: why so much fitness-related variation?","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Evolution & Ecology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"This proposal addresses several theoretical problems of the physics of strongly correlated electrons. One problem I am planning to address in my research is what kind of the physical behavior occurs in an electronic liquid (Fermi liquid) when the latter approaches an instability. Another direction of my work deals with search and analysis of the theoretical models for the phenomenon of the high-temperature superconductivity.                                                                        

The physical issues this proposal addresses lie in the core of interests of the condensed matter community. I anticipate a high impact of my work which, from a broader point of view, would be beneficiary for an overall standing of the condensed matter physics research in Canada.

"Identifying significant relationships in an uncertain environment, using data from multiple sources, is extremely important in discovering novelty in pattern discovery. For example, linking genotype and phenotype attributes plays a vital role in understanding the biological processes, under normal or novel conditions involving genetic modifications and changes, in problems such as the engineering of novel bioproducts. We propose to study biological processes as an information system that includes identifying relationships of functional segments and molecular sites of biomolecules, and aim at understanding their effects on biomolecular structure and functionality. We study the problem as a data-mining problem using the paradigm of granular computing and propose analysis methods based on different types of multiple-value (multi-attribute) association patterns extracted from an alignment of data. The patterns are based on analysis of statistical testing from a prior model. The goal is to provide a very flexible analysis/synthesis through selection, partitioning and attribute clustering etc. of the data. The paradigm incorporating hierarchical and modular analysis aims at a more generalized model than contiguous sequential pattern analysis and is more descriptive than multiple-variable analysis. After detecting significant patterns, further pattern-mining methods to understand the inter-pattern relationships will be developed. 



The proposal plans to apply to many real world problems, including whole molecule and sub-molecule analysis, transgenic species comparisons, metagenomics and comparative proteomics analysis in the production of biomaterials. Other applications in engineering such as image and visual analysis, text analysis will also be considered.

"Many natural systems and phenomena are highly complex. To gain an adequate understanding of them, scientists develop quantitative techniques to address different aspects of the underlying structures. Observable quantities used in such techniques contain uncertainty, often substantial due to the schemes in which biological data are collected. If such uncertainty is not addressed properly, our understanding of nature would be limited. Statistical modelling can account for such uncertainty. For this proposal, I develop such models, focusing on two major areas: biological network structures, and so-called change-point phenomena.

   Biological networks such as food webs have been analyzed quantitatively by (1) descriptive indices defined on the interaction activity levels among species, and (2) so-called computer models that are based on theory in biophysics and/or biochemistry. Other types of biological networks include protein networks in genetical research. Many existing techniques for studying biological network structures do not account for the large amount of uncertainty in the data. My goal is to develop a unifying approach that incorporates bio-physical/chemical theory and statistical modelling principles for complex time-varying network structures. The proposed methodology can address many concerns associated with traditional techniques in biological network research, thus contributing to the advancement of research in this area, as well as the applicability of statistical science to the general scientific community.

   Change-point phenomena occur in many natural contexts, e.g. how our climate responds to a major man-made disaster. Traditional techniques assume the change in response is sudden; in my Ph.D. research, I developed a methodology based on the statistical model which I coined the ""bent cable,"" to assess the abruptness of such changes, and found that traditional assumptions are often unfounded, especially in biological contexts where uncertainty is substantial. Since then, I have and will continue to extend the methodology to account for more general data types, including temporally and spatially dependent data.

"The success of an animal depends on its ability to do three basic things: to forage, to avoid being eaten and to successfully reproduce. Consequently, the question of how animals avoid predation is a central issue in biology. To avoid predators prey need to constantly assess their risk of predation, hence this is the major focus of my research program. As a first step, our work will address how prey animals learn to distinguish predators from non-predators. This is a crucial pre-requisite for being able to respond to predators and is essential to allow the prey to avoid costly responses to animals that are not a threat. The second major focus of our work centers on understanding how variation in predation risk through time will influence behavioural decisions of prey. Temporal variation in risk has far reaching implications for decisions about when and where animals will forage and reproduce, which mates they select and how much effort they devote to territory defence. This is a rapidly emerging field that has the potential to completely revolutionize our thinking in many sub-disciplines of behavioural ecology. Recognition of predation risk by fishes is often mediated by chemical 'alarm cues' released from specialized club cells in the skin when the fish is captured by a predator. We recently showed that these cells likely evolved in an immune context to minimize effects from damage to the skin, and that the alarm function of the cells evolved secondarily because selection favours prey responding to information indicating that a nearby individual was recently captured. We will continue this exciting work specifically testing whether fishes increase their alarm cell investment as a protective measure when exposed to UVB radiation. The final focus of the proposal will be to examine the effects of metals on the chemosensory recognition of predators by fishes, thereby directly linking the behavioural ecology of risk assessment with metal contamination. Understanding the potential harmful effects of metals on aquatic ecosystems is particularly important as the mining industry continues to expand in Canada. A major emphasis in this proposal is on the training of HQP; I will train 5 PhD students through the course of this grant cycle.

"The proposed research program is in the fields of solid state physics, materials science and renewable energy. In particular, it focuses on extensive computer simulations of microscopic electronic, dynamical and optical properties of semiconductors, metals and nanomaterials in a wide temperature range. The fundamental results obtained will be used for (i) optical non-invasive monitoring of materials in a wide temperature range and active chemical environments; (ii) determination of the macroscopic properties through ""computer experiments"" that will be compared to actual experiment and (iii) optimization of new materials and systems by combining the above micro- and macro-properties. The materials include wide-gap semiconductors used for bright displays, crystalline, amorphous, poly-crystalline and nano-crystalline silicon for thin film solar cells, and new materials such as carbon nanotubes, for the next generation of photovoltaics. Diamond will also be modeled, not only due to its ""quantum crystal"" behaviour, but also because polycrystalline diamond has already found extensive application in modern technology and industry. It is predicted that nano-diamonds will revolutionize side effect-free drug delivery in medicine, and optical techniques still remains the main tool to experimentally characterize such promising materials. It is important to stress that the verification of theoretical results will be done through close collaboration with a few renowned experimental groups working in the areas of implementation of the optical techniques and growth of layered or nano systems for both microelectronic and photovoltaic applications. The research will be based on intensive use of High Performance Computing SHARCNET (Shared Hierarchical Research Computing Network) facilities. The program will deliver training and learning combined with advanced research in solid state physics, computing science, and renewable energy and will actively involve undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in investigations, preparation of research reports, conference presentations and publishing of research papers. The HQP will be exposed to both national and international research communities through joint collaboration.

"The integration of complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (ICs), micro/nano technologies, and photonics continues to increase and shows a great promise for the development of a variety of devices and technologies that can pervasively impact all aspects of our society. The long term objective of the proposed research is to investigate, design, and develop sensor microsystems through the integration of CMOS based devices and systems with a variety of existing and emerging biochemical recognition elements including enzymes, DNA, organic/inorganic dyes, and functional nanoparticles. These microsystems will be useful in sensing, imaging, diagnostic or therapeutic applications for in-hospital/out-of-hospital monitoring, disease/epidemics prevention, environmental monitoring, food/water safety, and national security. To this end, during the five year period of this proposed research one can expect a variety of novel sensor microsystems that: [i] are miniaturized and battery-operated for ubiquitous applicability, [ii] have integrated stimulation, detection, and signal processing/transmission components, [iii] are self-contained and can be easily deployed, [iv] can simultaneously detect/quantify multiple analytes in a sample, [v] are simple and inexpensive to construct and operate, [vi] are accurate, precise, and reliable, and [vii] provide adequate detection limits and selectivity. The activities in the proposed research are divided into three themes:  (A) CMOS based phase fluorometric platform for biochemical monitoring, (B) CMOS integrated porous nanostructured sensors, and (C) Lab-on-a-chip sensor microsystems.

"Near-sightedness (myopia) develops when eyes grow too long for their optics.  In addition to certain visual cues, accommodation, the act of focussing on nearby objects has been implicated  as a driving force for myopia development in humans.  The lens is the structure in the eye that controls focussing and the retina is the structure that controls eye growth.

  The long-term aim is to determine how the lens and retina interact to control eye growth.  The short term goals are to first determine the cellular mechanisms underlying how the retina and lens function.  The work will be carried out on two fronts, 1) by examining how eyes with altered retinas respond to environmental growth signals and 2) by examining how the cells of the lens control, or are controlled by focussing.  Chicks will be used for these studies because, like humans, they are diurnal, have colour vision and focus by deforming the lens.

  1) CELLULAR CHANGES TO THE RETINA - Disconnecting the eye from the brain by severing the opitc nerve not only removes the drive to focus but also results in a shorter than normal eye, indicating altered eye growth.  Optic nerve-section also results in loss of some cells in the retina therefore optic nerve-sectioned eyes will be used to probe how and which cells of the retina control eye growth in response to visual signals.

  2) CELLULAR CHANGES TO THE ACCOMMODATING LENS - Studies suggest that subcellular structrual proteins within the lens might impart contractile activity to the lens.  In addition, mechanical stress has been shown to induce biochemical activity within other cells, yet studies of the cellular changes that affect and are affected by a deforming (mechanically stressed) lens have been neglected.  An accommodation model, which allows direct measurement of the lens during nerve-stimulated focussing, will be used to investigate how the subcellular structures of the lens are affected by naturally-induced mechanical stress and other growth-related changes to the eye.

"The main aim of the proposal is to carry out fundamental and application oriented research into ultrafast magnetic phenomena. The research focuses on developing a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic behaviour of low dimensional magnetic materials, in which one or more characteristic length scales have been reduced to nanometer range, on the picosecond time scale. 

The proposed research programs are directly relevant to magnetic information technology, where information is written on a magnetic medium by reversing the magnetization direction using a recording head. When considering current data access time faster than 1 Gb/sec, understanding the real time magnetodynamics in small magnets at the fundamental level becomes more and more crucial for the development of high-performance information-storage media. 

Our apparatus, which combines an ultrafast magnetic microscope using magneto-optics with ultrathin -down to few atomic layers thick- film preparation/characterization in an ultrahigh vacuum environment, will provide the capability of determining the effects of material structures and intrinsic magnetic properties on nonequilibrium magnetodynamics in a clear and unambiguous manner. 

The practical outcome of the proposed research is the fully controllable manipulation of the magnetization dynamics in micro- and nanostructures with magnetic field or electric current pulses. In particular, the manipulation of magnetization by electric currents is believed to be a key technology for future microelectronics. Our research will drastically change the circuit design of the current magnetic storage devices and lead to all-electrically controlled magneto-electronic devices, which is indispensable for ultra-high-density storage application.

"Because of the need in quantum information theory,  a thorough study of pure mathematics with new approaches will be carried out in this research.    As extensions from function theory to matrix theory and operator theory, there have been fruitful results on probability and geometry, showing many aspects of non-commutative spectral analysis. 



Based on some previous results of the proposer, this research work will be carried out on a variety of topics on numerical ranges and normal dilations, in connection to convex structure, spectral variations, matrix synthesis, and harmonic analysis.    There will also be an investigation on the dynamical features of the crossed product  C*-algebras.

"With the increasing threat of biological warfare worldwide and the outbreak of various highly contagious diseases, the development of strategies and equipment to detect and control the spread of these biological elements and diseases is of vital importance.  To this end, being able to identify the existence of biological elements and virus carriers becomes highly desirable.  Recently, several research groups have shown that, using surface modified micro-cantilevers, a few disease-related DNAs (e.g., prostate cancer) can be detected.  This is because upon binding of the target DNA onto the micro-cantilever surface, the micro-cantilever would bend.  It would be most desirable to further the technique to detect various protein molecules possessed by highly contagious/dangerous viruses or other biological substances.  The extension of the technique to detect target viral protein molecules is challenging since DNA and protein molecules possess different characteristics.  Key technical issues involved are the selection and immobilization of protein molecules that would function as probe molecules, the ability to measure the target molecules at minute concentrations and the detection time.  Unless the above technical issues are resolved, construction of such a commercial biosensor is not feasible.  In order to do so, a fundamental understanding of the physics involved in the detection principle is required.  And this is the major thrust of the proposed research.  The proposed research program will focus on developing molecular modelling strategies, based on molecular dynamics simulation and/or density functional theory calculation, to investigate hybridization of the DNA/protein molecules on micro/nano-mechanical cantilever surfaces.  If we succeed, we envision that the results could be used to guide the selection of probe molecules for the hybridization process and the design of a prototype of hand-held biosensor for ground solider and homeland security applications.

"Correlated data arise in many forms in genetic and biomedical problems, such as from studies of pairs of eyes, repeated asthma attacks, or families carrying a disease gene. In order to better understand the disease process we are studying, we need to develop new statistical models that can handle these relationships in our data. The recent progress in genetics, genomics, and other 'omics' research has created new types of correlated data that cannot be analyzed using the current methods.  Two important features of these new types of data include how the patients or families were picked as well as how strong or weak the similarity is within families or pairs of eyes or asthma episodes.  A statistical method that can handle this type of correlation or similarity is called a frailty model. It can be used to understand and control different types of correlation, such as a common gene, family relationships or specific environmental effects like particular foods or supplements. 

     My research plan is to develop a general statistical framework for handling correlated data from complex study designs based on frailty modeling approach for outcomes that happen over time.  Some examples where my research would help are to provide analytical strategies for modeling family-based survival data from complex study design and to provide major public health implication for the genetic counseling of individuals at risk in families carrying disease-susceptibility genes. I will achieve my research plan by working through three goals that will build upon each other: (1) develop a general approach for modeling multivariate survival data with complex correlation structure, (2) take into account how the patients or families were chosen (e.g., from a colon cancer clinic for families with many relatives with colon cancer or from patients who continue to have many episodes of asthma) and (3) adapt my new approaches for specific studies measuring thousands of genes in each person to try to understand how the genes work together.

     This research program will have many important biomedical applications including risk modeling using family data and estimating the effects of collections of genes from genomic experiments.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","Statistical Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Many physical systems exhibit complex patterns. For example, a system may display spatial regions of  two different phases with the interface between them resembling a complex surface. Often, the observed structure can be explained  or simulated by a variational principle in which a free energy 

of any admissible structure can be computed, with the observed structure being the one with the lowest energy. The resulting variational problems are challenging to say the least. If one wishes to analysis them without first adopting assumptions which severley limit possible geometric complexities, one needs advanced mathematical analysis. 



This proposal pertains to both mathematical and physical paradigms for energy-driven pattern  formation associated with  competing short and long-range interactions. The physical paradigm is provided by diblock copolymers which have a remarkable ability for self-assembly into many fascinating structures; the interfaces of which resemble triply-periodic surfaces whose mean curvature is constant. 



The goal of this proposal is two-fold: First, using the variational problem (the mathematical paradigm), we will address some central questions in the calculus of variations concerning scale and geometry. Second, within the general framework of variational problems, we will address the underlying physical application; phase separation in diblock copolymers melts. 



The techniques expoited range from rigorous analysis and geometry to statistical physics and numerical simulations.

"Being part of a social group creates needs that require specialized behavioral and neurobiological responses. The novel and recently defined field of social neuroscience aims at understanding the neurobiological bases of social behavior. My and my students' research program will focus on the neurobiology of cognitive aspects of social behavior in mammals. Among many facets of social behavior, we will place particular emphasis on those that require a high level of cognitive involvement. In particular, using rodents, we will focus on: (1) Social Recognition, the ability to recognize individuals. This specific form of learning has implications for a number of social behaviors, from mating and social preferences to the recognition and avoidance of parasitized individuals. (2) Social Learning, whereby an individual acquires biologically relevant and adaptive information from other individuals, allows one to avoid the costs often associated with individual learning. Despite its high adaptiveness and commonality in numerous species, the understanding of the neurobiological bases of social learning is, at present, extremely limited. (3) Social Reactivity, the behavioral responses of animals when in the presence of members of their own species.      We will continue on going investigations on the role of various neurochemical systems in social behavior, through the integrative use of behavioral, pharmacological, neurobiological, molecular and genetic research methodologies. Identifying the neural and hormonal processes subserving normal social behavior could aid in the development of novel treatments of abnormal social behavior, thus helping several vexing human disorders. Among many, these include autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and schizotypical disorders, social phobias and anxiety, as well as hyperaggression and violence. Furthermore, given that individual and social learning can be neurobiologically different, today's minimal knowledge of the mechanisms of social learning is a serious drawback for the evaluation of various agents (e.g. of new and old (!) drug therapies) on learning and memory. Our research will contribute to filling this gap in knowledge and help to advance research in social neuroscience in Canada.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"Eriophorum vaginatum is a tussock forming sedge that grows abundantly in the northern wetlands. We localized extensive populations of this species growing in metal-contaminated sites near Sudbury, ON. One hundred years resource exploitation and mineral processing in this part of Canada has given a rise to metal and acid contaminated soils, sadly creating an ideal study site in search of innate plant species resistant to heavy metals. E. vaginatum is an excellent model to study metal tolerance in a search for native bioremediator of polluted wetland sites in the northern hemisphere. It is hardy, deep rooted perennial and forms long lasting, dense tussocks and it is early succession dominant species. My earlier work described structure of the corm, where atypical vascular ring aided to xylem and phloem transport. The origin of vascular ring is unknown. Using LCSM and serial sectioning, I propose to determine whether vascular ring is formed by activity of apical meristem or it is formed by diverging leaf traces at the nodes. I also identified sclerenchyma cells associated with vascular bundles, only present in E. vaginatum. A systematic study will reveal sclerid development and lignification to determine whether those add to the metal tolerance. Using ICP-MS, I will determine the concentration of metals in the all parts of the E. vaginatum to demonstrate whether E. vaginatum is a hyperaccumulator or biostabilizator of the pollutants from Sudbury region. Furthermore, with the aid of LCSM and Al-specific fluorescent probes, I will localize accumulated Al at the tissue, cellular and subcellular levels to reveal the mechanism of Al tolerance in this species. Pattern of branching and roots formation will be determined by CT scans. These 3- D imaged might reveal that roots are sheltered from external pollutants by microsite of the tussock, which could contribute to E. vaginatum resistance to contaminants. Lastly, microarray analysis of genes involved in metal tolerance in E. vaginatum will be performed to identify genes that are up- and down-regulated in response to metals. This research may lead to the use of E. vaginatum in biostabilization and revegetation of the contaminated wetlands in the northern hemisphere.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Plant Biology & Food Science",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"One of the best methods to interpret/predict various kinds of electron spectra is density functional theory (DFT).  My recent expertise lies mainly in two areas, namely design of basis sets and application of DFT to electron spectroscopy.  The objectives of the proposed research program have multiple directions.  We want to improve the method for predictions of X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) and X-ray emission spectra (XES), and to extend my expertise in electron spectroscopy of gas-phase molecules (a) to heavier elements in the fourth row, and (b) to solid-state systems.  During the past decade, we have been extremely successful in applying DFT to electron spectra.  See http://www.chem.ubc.ca/personnel/faculty/chong/index.shtml and the recent publications listed therein.  We started with core-electron binding energies (CEBEs) of B to F in 1995 and have recently extended the study to 2p CEBEs of Si to Ar in 2006, with the average absolute deviations (AADs) of 0.15 eV and 0.26 eV, respectively.  Valence-electron ionizations and excitations have also been calculated easily, with AADs of 0.4 eV and 0.2 eV respectively.  Difficulty with basis sets was encountered for excitations to higher Rydberg levels and we have plans for how to overcome that problem.  With the ability to predict XAS also, we have been able to predict both resonant and non-resonant XES of H2CO in a recent paper.  The method has recently been extended to SiH4, PH3, H2S, HCl, and Ar.  The novelty of our approach is that we first determine the best level of treatment for each kind of spectra of and have therefore succeeded in greatly reducing the AADs.  Solids introduce additional problems.  For ionization spectra, the work function and other dielectric effects (collectively called the WD term) shifts spectra to lower energies.  So far, we have treated WD as an empirical parameter.  Modeling of solids and surface reconstruction are other problems that must be faced.  Having efficient and reliable methods for gas-phase spectra helps us in extending the studies to solid state.  The significance of the proposed study is that experimental electron spectra of solid-state systems may be interpreted more easily.   If funded, I plan to visit my colleagues again to continue the collaborations.

"    )	The proposed research is aimed at developing new methods for the synthesis of chiral compounds.  Since the chirality or handedness of a drug can have a major impact on its biological activity, it is important to make potential drugs either entirely left-handed or right-handed.  The focus will be on creating new reagents to carry out transformations which are not currently possible using existing methodology or have significant advantages over existing methodology.    )	

    )	We will examine new ways in which we can prepare organic compounds with defined stereochemistry.  An emphasis will be placed on developing carbon-carbon bond forming reactions which use only a catalytic amount of chiral ligands.  The simultaneous construction of the carbon framework along with establishing the absolute stereochemistry of organic molecules is inherently efficient.  We were the first to show that this approach to asymmetric synthesis is possible using ligand exchange on alkynylboronates.  An obvious advantage of this approach is that only sub-stoichiometric amounts of ligands are required.  A less obvious aspect is that processes could be developed using this approach that will avoid the use of heavy metals, an important consideration in the preparation of pharmaceuticals and as chemists become more environmentally conscientious.  We will now expand this chemistry to other reagents and substrates.  New ligands tailored to optimize reactivity and selectivity will be prepared; these may be useful in these reactions or other asymmetric processes.  

    )	Overall, the research will lead to new methods for the preparation of stereochemically-defined organic molecules as well as to a better understanding of how stereochemistry can be controlled using chiral ligands.

"The global seafood market is at a crossroads. While landings by global capture fisheries have leveled off, and many fish stocks have essentially collapsed, demand for seafood has been rising steadily, leading to the fast expansion of aquaculture. However, industrialized intensive finfish fed monoculture practices are showing they also have limits. Various approaches have been suggested to improve the deficiencies of the ""Blue Revolution"". One such responsible aquaculture practice, which we are developing in Canada, is integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA). The IMTA concept is based on an age-old, common sense, recycling and farming practice in which the by-products from one species become inputs for another: fed aquaculture (finfish) is combined with inorganic extractive (seaweed) and organic extractive (shellfish) aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability (biomitigation), economic stability (product diversification and risk reduction) and social acceptability (better management practices).

This Discovery Grant will contribute to gaining knowledge on: a) the nitrogen metabolic pathways of seaweeds, b) their morphological plasticity and its degree of environmental and genetic control, and c) the culture techniques to use for an edible seaweed with a complex life history. It is anticipated that this research will help to: a) differentiate IMTA products based on their protein and amino acid profiles to diversify in high value-added niche markets, b) select the best strains of kelps for quality products and optimized biomitigation, and c) develop the cultivation of another seaweed crop to grow when kelps have already been harvested and, consequently, the biomitigating seaweed biomass needs to be temporary replaced. This discovery research will, hence, contribute to optimizing the overall balanced efficiency of IMTA systems and, consequently, increase the social acceptability of the aquaculture sector in Canada and beyond, as our research group is presently at the forefront of the development of IMTA systems.

"Aquaculture production, which already supplies over 40% of the seafood consumed worldwide, has increased

rapidly over the last few decades, making it the fastest growing global food production sector; however, there

are concerns regarding environmental, economic and social impacts associated with aquaculture. An innovative

solution for the environmental sustainability, economic stability and societal acceptability of aquaculture is

integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA). IMTA combines the cultivation of fed species (e.g. finfish) with

organic extractive species (e.g. shellfish) and inorganic extractive species (e.g. seaweed) for a balanced

ecosystem management approach, considering site specificity, operational limits, and food safety regulations.

The proposed Canadian IMTA Network (CIMTAN) focuses on developing a key network of researchers from

across Canada to further develop IMTA approaches to strategically enhance economically sustainable

production systems. The ultimate goal of CIMTAN is to develop systems, adopted by its industrial partners, to

efficiently mitigate organic and inorganic enrichment of fed aquaculture operations by actively recapturing this

material to turn it into the production of extractive crops, hence transforming associated environmental and

socio-economic issues into benefits for not only the industrial partners, but also for all Canadians.

CIMTAN will undertake an inter-disciplinary approach including a strong HQP training component to generate

new knowledge on alternative aquacultured species based on their biomitigative functions and economic value.

CIMTAN will go beyond addressing natural science and/or engineering questions, and will address

socio-economic and regulatory governance components, required for the full development of the sector.

CIMTAN will create the conditions for increased economic opportunities in rural/coastal regions, including

First Nations communities, providing sustainable, quality seafood to Canadians, concomitant with increased

societal acceptance of the aquaculture sector and public policy development for improved government

decision-making.

"Biomanufacturing processes often contain three major components, namely upstream strain development, midstream cell cultivation, and downstream purification processing. Biological cells with an enhanced ability for the production of desired bioproducts, either ribosomal or non-ribosomal, are isolated or genetically constructed. They are then cultivated in bioreactors for multiplication. Following cultivation, a series of downstream processing steps are adopted for bioproduct purification. While construction of production strains is generally recognized as a key prerequisite for successful bioprocess development, downstream processing could account for a big portion of the capital and operation costs of the overall bioprocess. Hence, developing strategies for effective downstream processing becomes a challenging task for bioengineers. Nysa Membrane Technologies, Inc. is a Canadian company in possession of a novel, proprietary membrane-based platform technology with broad global applications in protein purification and other biological and industrial separations. By establishing the hydrogel technologies which can complement technical limitations associated with pure polymeric membranes, the company has so far developed several hydrogel membrane products for clarification (i.e. microfiltration), chromatography (i.e. anion/cation exchange), and concentration (i.e. ultrafiltration) steps. These products have special features, such as high flux, high binding capacity, and high mechanical strength, based on which they are able to outperform many existing commercial products. Recognizing the lack of commercial membrane products practically applied for manufacturing of clinical-grade bioproducts, the company is interested in commercializing their products by targeting the global market in biopharmaceutical and plasmid DNA manufacturing. To this end, the company will need to establish their platform technology as a superior alternative to the conventional one for bioproduct purification. This is the primary goal of the proposed project, a collaborative work between Nysa and University of Waterloo.","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Ontario,Ontario
"In this proposed research, various molecular and bioprocessing aspects associated with disulfide bond formation will be explored and integrated with the strategies for gene overexpression to improve the performance of heterologous expression. Two eukaryotic proteins, i.e. an industrial enzyme of PalB and a therapeutic protein of hCD83ext, will be used as the model molecules for study. PalB contains three intramolecular disulfide bonds which are critical for its solubility and enzymatic activity, whereas hCD83ext contains five cysteine residues involved in the formation of intermolecular and intramolecular disulfide bonds related with its therapeutic bioactivity. Our recent experimental results based upon the heterologous expression of these two proteins in E. coli suggest the technical importance associated with in vivo disulfide bond formation, which could be mediated in a more effective, rigorous, specific, and controllable manner at the bioprocessing stage of either cultivation or downstream processing. To overcome these technical hurdles as the objective of the proposed research, the host and vector system will be genetically manipulated to enhance the expression level, folding efficiency, disulfide bond formation, stability, and bioactivity of the recombinant proteins. The scientific and technical development primarily includes: (1) recombinant DNA technology for gene overexpression, (2) fusion protein and chaperone coexpression technologies to increase the protein solubility, (3) graft of a genetic system for effective formation of disulfide bonds and precise targeting of recombinant proteins in various expression compartments, (4) design of mutant derivatives for consistent and controllable disulfide bond formation, and (5) downstream bioprocessing associated with these molecular strategies for bioactivity development and protein recovery. The outcome of the proposed research is expected to not only shed light on enhancing the efficiency of various posttranslational processings upon heterologous gene overexpression in E. coli but also complement the technical deficiencies currently limiting the expression of eukaryotic proteins in the prokaryotic system of E. coli for many biomanufacturing applications.

"The main and general goal of my research proposal lies in quantifying, as precise as possible, the effect of additional uncertainty in a financial economic model. Precisely, I will focus on the additional information/uncertainty coming from  the random horizons. An investor is subject to different kind of exit times and the risk they induce. In real life, exit time examples are numerous such as death's time, expected or unexpected retirement time, the time when the investor is fired from her job, or -general speaking- any random time when the investor is forced to liquidate her assets and quit the market. Each exit time has its specific risk, whose effect is not known nor the modeling of this random time itself. Our goal is to analyze the effect of exit time on the optimal consumption, and to draw the applications of these in Public Economic and Finance. My approach is based on the martingale theory, and precisely on the family of martingale measures that I introduced and developed with Striker in a number of papers.  To achieve this economical goal, I will address the mathematical challenges and problems that are put forward by my methods and the steps of the proposed study. I will establish connection between different concepts through this study (such as random horizon problem  vs uncertainty models). The problem of random horizons has many applications, such as in credit risk, and I will explore these applications and contribute in these areas using new method.

"Impurities and defects in condensed matter systems are interesting and important. In addition to the fascinating fundamental physics phenomena associated with these centers, the behavior of only a minute amount of impurities/defects inside many such materials (especially semiconductors) determines their eventual usefulness in practical applications since they dramatically modify the optical and/or electrical properties of the host. One of my primary research activities is the elucidation of the local structure, diffusitivities, interactions, and reactions of isolated impurities in bulk and nano-scale semiconductors, insulators, and metals.  Furthermore, some of these impurities, which I intentionally introduce into the materials, can be used as microscopic probes of the magnetism in the material where they reside.  In fact, another of my research activities is the investigation of several types of interesting magnetic systems and the study of near surface structural phase transitions. Moreover, I also study the technological implications of defect-induced phenomena in correlated electronic systems such as colossal magnetoresistance materials and high temperature superconductors. 



Hence, my proposed research program has these general goals: (i) provide new experimental information, at the microscopic level, on how defects/impurities can be used to control the properties of relevant devices of the present and the future, and (ii) test theorectical predictions of interesting phenomena in materials where there is thus far no accepted general understanding.

"Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are a type of programmable integrated circuit that can be used to build digital hardware circuits. Typically, they are used as a way to build chips for specific applications without going through the time and expense of building customized integrated circuits that can only be used for that one application. The programmability provides a means for making rapid changes, especially during the early stages of testing and debugging. The programmability of FPGAs also means that they can be used in a similar way that we use microprocessors. Microprocessors execute functions according to a software program that can be loaded, run, and then changed to a different program that does a different application. FPGAs can also be used in the same manner. Instead of software programs, FPGAs are loaded with circuits that can compute the same function as the software, but in a much more efficient way. The generality of software

means that there is also a large overhead for the generality. Building a special circuit in an FPGA makes it more efficient so that the program can run faster than it would in software.



The challenge in today's world is to find efficient ways to define the desired functionality, i.e., the program, for the FPGA because it involves hardware design, which is much more difficult than software design. The proposed research explores methods for programming FPGAs that makes the process look much more like writing software. The long term goal is to make it feasible for an application specialist, who only knows how to write software, to be able to write programs for FPGAs. This proposal will explore the use of software programming models for FPGAs and implement several applications as the means for driving and understanding the requirements. A successful outcome would be to demonstrate significant working applications running on FPGA systems where the programs have been described in a more software-friendly manner.

"Our research program has developed a series of ecological indicators to help determine quality of coastal wetlands in the Great Lakes basin because these are critical habitats for fish and migratory birds and their quality has been degraded by human activities, especially in southern Ontario.  The suite of indicators include the Water Quality Index (WQI), an indicator of water quality impairment and which was found to be directly related to watershed land-use alteration.  Since the WQI may be too costly and labour-intensive to be used routinely by environmental agencies, we have also developed two ecological indices, the Wetland Fish Index, and the Wetland Macrophyte Index, which are statistically related to the WQI, and which can be calculated based on presence/absence of fish or macrophyte species.  We have also contributed numerous papers on the controlling effect of water level fluctuations on emergent vegetation in coastal wetlands, particularly as it pertains to degraded marshes. In 2005, we used a new approach to predict the effect of water levels, which involved the calculation of a new term called ""inundated area"".  We have since confirmed that the marsh inundation model can be applied to many marshes in other Great Lakes areas, and that this method can also be used to assess the effects of multiple stressors (e.g. water level, human disturbance and exotic invasions) at the landscape level.  We now propose to use an integrated approach involving Geographical Information Systems, remote sensing technology and field observations using SCUBA to quantify fish and bird habitat in coastal wetlands.  Remote sensing is chosen to develop a cost-effective way to map aquatic vegetation (different habitat classes) at the scale of an entire Great Lake.  My long term goal is to advance the use of ecological indicators and remote sensing to meaure how fish and bird habitat change through time.  This research is expected to have an impact on the ability of Canadian governments to anticipate major changes in our natural heritage in response to climate change and land-use alterations in the most heavily populated region of Canada.

"The lysosome is a small organelle within the cell essential for keeping our body healthy. More than a dozen of enzyme-proteins are packaged and stored within the lysosome. They function by digesting and removing harmful metabolic products as well as foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Unfortunately, a lysosomal enzyme may malfunction because of genetic mutations that render it inactive/unstable. One such example is the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Harmful mutations in the GBA gene result in Gaucher disease, a panethnic and most frequent lysosomal disorder. Because of GBA deficiency, a lipid known as glucocerebroside accumulates to very high and toxic levels in the cells of visceral organs, blood, and bones that results in Gaucher disease, and occasionally in the brain, resulting in the neuropathic, lethal form of Gaucher disease and death. The mechanism(s) by which the genetic mutations render the enzyme nonfunctional is not very well understood. In this proposal, we plan to continue the identification of the GBA mutations at the DNA level and examine their effects on the synthesis, structure/function, and transport of GBA to the lysosome. Since mutations in Gaucher disease may also result from interaction between the 2 copies of the GBA gene in our genome (all non-primate mammals have only 1 copy), we will survey the presence of the 2 GBA copies in other primates in order to learn more about its molecular evolution which reflects our past, and how the two GBA genes interact in processes known as `gene conversion' and `recombination' that may disrupt GBA function. Using recombinant DNA and stem cell technologies, we plan to genetically engineer a mouse model of neuropathic Gaucher disease (we already have created a non-neuropathic mouse model) to study the cell biology and pathophysiology in the brain. We will also attempt to produce copious amounts of human GBA, in genetically-modified insect or yeast cells, for further biochemical analysis. One form of GBA produced will have an extra `protein transduction domain' and be tested in experimental mice for its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier for treatment of brain disease.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"Nitric oxide (NO) is a bioactive gas involved in many aspects of human physiology.  It is synthesized in cells by three related enzymes: neuronal nitric oxide synthase, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and endothelial NOS.  While all of these enzymes are important in the generation of NO under different biological circumstances, I have recently identified a role for iNOS expression in human T cells in the augmentation of human immune responses and shown that the chemokine stromal cell derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1a) is a protein inducer of iNOS in human T cells.  However, the intracellular mechanisms regulating iNOS expression in T cells are unknown.  Also, the regulation of iNOS expression in human cells, in general, is incompletely defined and is very different than that in animals commonly used to study mammalian biology, namely mice and rats.  Therefore, the goal of my proposal is to understand the regulation of SDF-1a-induced iNOS expression in human T cells, and the role this plays in human T cell biology.  The first part will study the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate SDF-1a-induced iNOS expression in human T cells.  This will involve the inhibition of expression of the signaling enzymes ERK1/2 and PI3K by siRNA molecules, and then examination of SDF-1a-induced iNOS expression in human T cells lacking expression of ERK1/2 and PI3K.  The role of Ras in mediating a potential feedback regulatory loop will also be examined.  The second part of the proposal will determine the DNA elements and related transcription factors controlling the expression of the iNOS gene in human T cells. Finally, the third part of the proposal will examine the role of SDF-1a-induced iNOS in human T cell survival and migration.  I have recently found that NO can inhibit cell death of human T cells and I will examine whether NO produced from iNOS in response to SDF-1a acts in a similar manner.  The described work will be of interest to cell biologists and immunologists as it will provide new information on the regulation of iNOS expression in human cells, and insight into T cell biology as it relates to human immunity.

"The Christendat lab uses structural, enzymological and biochemical approaches to investigate enzymes of the shikimate pathway in plants and microbes. There are two major themes being investigated in the lab: 1) The mechanism by which the pathway enzymes are regulated in plants and 2) the evolutionary relationship of the shikimate pathway enzymes in plants and microbes.  The results from these two themes will contribute to a better understanding of the shikimate pahway which could eventually facilitate metabolic engineering of crops to enhance their nutritional contents and also facilitate the development of novel antimicrobial and herbicidal agents.

"Management authorities throughout the world are gradually moving toward ecosystem-based management of fisheries. It is clear that ecosystem modeling has a clear contribution to make as part of this move, and clear attention needs to be devoted to ensure that the scientific foundation on which we base the modeling is solid. This proposed activity aims to help improving the foundation through targeted, supportive research. 

A majority of the current ecosystem modeling activities in support of an ecosystem approach to fisheries are based on the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) approach and software system developed at the Fisheries Centre of the University of British Columbia. 

The perhaps most important findings from recent ecosystem modeling are that signals from changes in system productivity (nutrient loading or primary productivity) can be picked up at all trophic levels and that variation in productivity may be amplified through the food web rather than dampened as usually assumed. While this finding is important through its linking of oceanography to fisheries management as well as to biodiversity research, it also opens for at least two important lines of research questions, both of which it is only now possible to consider embarking due to the recent progress in using ecosystem modeling for fisheries management:

a.    )	What are the mechanisms that for some species cause variation in primary production to be amplified through the food web? Is it a general feature that may be explained through physiological processes? If so, why does it not apply to all species, is this a consequence of specific characteristics of the food web structure?

b.    )	Noting that environmental variation has marked impact on the exploited, upper part of the food web, how may climate change impact biodiversity and future food productivity from the oceans? How are various species likely to be impacted, and what may the consequences be for the Pacific Northwest?

"It is becoming increasingly apparent that both physical and mental exercise can have a number of benefits for our brains; positively impacting cognitive processing in both animals and humans. One area of the brain where these benefits are most apparent morphologically, as well as functionally, is the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation, a structure known to be involved in learning and memory. We have recently shown that exercise can promote both cellular proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus, increasing the turnover of cells in this region long after most brain development has ceased. In addition, exercise also has benefits for existing neurons, increasing both the length and complexity of their dendrites, as well as the number of synapses available for establishing inter-neuronal communication. Functionally, the hippocampus of animals that exercise is capable of exhibiting more long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic efficacy. This the main cellular model for how learning and memory processes could occur in the mammalian brain, and along with it's counterpart, long-term depression (LTD), provide a mechanism for neurons to alter the way that they communicate with one another. It is believed that such alterations are necessary to establish the changes in neuronal signaling that are thought to occur with learning. Thus far, the evidence indicates that exercise makes for a more dynamic hippocampus, while animals that do not engage in exercise have a hippocampus that is both morphologically and functionally more restricted and static.

The current proposal outlines a strategy that uses behaviour to help guide further electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analyses of the brain. In this manner we hope to better understand how exercise can benefit cognitive processes, and further unveil the organization of learning and memory processes in the brain.

"Recently developed steel self-centering systems offer designers an alternative to traditional yielding systems for enhancing the seismic resistance of structures. These self-centering structures achieve a maximum response that is similar to traditional systems such as braced frames, moment-resisting frames or shear walls, but they also minimize the damage by concentrating inelastic action at carefully selected locations that can be inspected and replaced, and assure a full re-centering of the structure even following a design level earthquake. However, these self-centering systems incorporate hysteretic damping elements and are designed for strength levels that are similar to their traditional counterparts. This leads to large accelerations which affect the damage to non-structural elements and to contents but also to large design forces which increase the cost of these structures. 



The proposed research program will investigate the possibility of fully defining and developing a new family of self-centering systems incorporating viscous type damping in order to significantly reduce the design lateral seismic loads and the accelerations that are sustained by current systems. The mechanics of such systems will first be defined, component and system full-scale experimental validations will be undertaken to confirm their response and will be complemented by numerical models that can adequately capture their response to strong seismic ground motion. A thorough investigation into the dynamics of such systems will also be carried out to allow for an optimization of the design loads as well as their seismic performance. Finally, a design procedure that is compatible with current seismic design codes will be proposed to allow structural engineers to implement these systems in real structures.

"Everyday, developed nations utilize sophisticated machines for transportation, manufacturing and many other applications. Almost all of these require lubrication to prevent wear and failure of the system. An estimate made in 1990 found that a nation could save on the order of a billion dollars annually through increased attention to tribological principles (i.e. reduction of friction and wear). These concepts become increasingly important as the world enters an era of energy consciousness. One strategy for aiding in aerospace and automotive systems is the use of solid coatings that provide mechanical protection from wear and lubrication by the inclusion of low friction materials. A highly effective, next generation class of coatings are nanocomposites consisting of a matrix of the relevant hard, protective and lubricating phases in nano-scale dimensions. The implementation of these coatings requires accurate data of their performance prior to their use in aerospace systems, where even one failure can be catastrophic. Another industrial area that requires increased attention to tribology is the manufacture of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). There is a strong desire in the MEMS industry to create reliable, complex devices with moving and contacting parts. Many aerospace coatings are also candidates for lubrication at the microscale. Successful utilization of tribological principles would lead to a next generation of innovative MEMS devices for a host of applications. This work will focus on two techniques to study next generation coatings for aerospace and MEMS applications. Using an in situ tribometer, in-service performance and changes of aerospace coatings will be examined. Direct observation of wear mechanisms will aid in the design and surface engineering necessary to optimize aerospace coating performance. For MEMS applications, coatings will be studied by nanoindenation for mechanical properties and microscale friction and wear properties. In summary, the tribology of coating materials will be studied over a range of length scales for advanced aerospace and MEMS applications.

"The objective of this project is to implement and develop the technology of field-cycled Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FCMRI).  The potential impact of this project is the achievement of a new, versatile NMR-based imaging modality with possible applications in the study of biomaterials, industrial process tomography, and small animal imaging.



During the past five years, I have worked on the development of a new approach to MRI, called field-cycled MRI.  In essence, FCMRI applies the established techniques of field-cycled NMR to the formation of MR images.  The fundamental innovation of FCMRI is the replacement of the static magnetic field used in normal MRI with two dynamically controlled magnetic fields.  During my post-doctoral fellowship, we developed the first FCMRI prototype scanner at Stanford University (which we called pMRI) and successfully collected images of phantoms, small animals, and human hands. During the past five years, I have established a new lab at the University of Western Ontario, and constructed a larger, more powerful version of the FCMRI system.



Potential advantages of FCMRI include: a nearly silent scanner; reduced image artifacts due to magnetic susceptibility differences in the object (e.g. to monitor fluid transport processes through porous media for materials science applications, or to allow imaging in the vicinity of an atificial knee for medical applications); the ability to increase the polarizing field strength without increasing absorbed RF power (SAR); increased versatility in MR image contrast; and the potential for combined positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI systems.  In this research project, I will focus on the detailed investigation of the method and technology of FCMRI, followed by application investigation and development.

"Increasing demand for communications calls for optical networks that are even more ubiquitous than they are today. Achieving this goal will require integrated photonic and electronic devices and systems that are low cost, small sized and high bandwidth. Such devices will then enable optics to penetrate further into important communication networks: fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), local and wide area networks (LAN, WAN), machine-to-machine connectivity, and wireless signal distribution. Eventually, these devices will find their way into emerging areas where optical interfaces are required: backplane communications (e.g. between CPU and memory) and inter-chip communication (e.g. between the multiple CPU cores). These applications require the development of low-cost semiconductor laser transmitters with much higher performance (>40 GHz operation) than presently available. The proposed work is a response to this need.



This project aims to develop a revolutionary semiconductor laser transmitter technology, based on the homogeneous integration of photonics and electronics. The new device, a TX-VCSEL (Transistor-Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser), consists of a Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT) and a Vertical Cavity Laser (VCSEL). We will model and design TX-VCSELs, fabricate 980 nm and 1310 nm TX-VCSELs, and develop high-speed driver electronics and packaging. The TX-VCSEL will be integrated with driver electronics, resulting in a very small and a very high frequency optical transmitter to increase optical communications network capacity and enable new network-intensive applications.

Integrating very high frequency digitally modulated VCSELs to CMOS will have a dramatic impact in the high-performance microprocessor world, removing the electrical interconnect bottlenecks. It will enable the next generation supercomputers, and hundreds of VCSELs may one day be present in home personal computers. The technology to be developed will benefit Canadian industry by enabling new applications and higher data throughput, thus enhancing Canada's role as a world leader in optical communication technology.

"Recent catastrophic disasters such as: failures of levees and bridges in New Orleans; failure of overpasses in Montreal; collapses of roofs of large civil structures in Germany, Poland, and Russia; land slides in California and the Philippines; and rock failures and loss of lives in deep coal mines in China have dramatically increased demand for improving the existing and developing new deformation monitoring systems. Automation, multi-sensor integration, continuous data collection, integrated analysis, and enhanced accuracy and reliability of deformation surveys are the key issues to be addressed in the proposed research. The applicant and his associates at the Canadian Centre for Geodetic Engineering (CCGE) at UNB have been involved in the development of new methods and techniques for monitoring structural and ground deformations since mid '70s. Over the past two decades CCGE has gained world recognition as being among the leading centres in the development and implementation of new techniques and methods for monitoring, modeling, and prediction of structural and ground deformations. One example is the recent development of the ALERT software suite for fully automated and continuous monitoring of deformations. Over the last 5 years, the ALERT system has been commercialized and employed in monitoring large earth dams and open pit mines in Canada, USA, Chile, and Venezuela. The current version of ALERT uses geodetic Robotic Total Stations (RTS) linked with GPS receivers. This version, though perfectly suited to its current applications, would be unable to completely satisfy all monitoring needs. In order to satisfy needs of structural monitoring (e.g. monitoring of roofs of large structures, tunnels, pipelines, bridges) the ALERT system will be augmented by additional geodetic and various geotechnical sensors to provide a versatile and fully automated multi-sensor monitoring system. The focus will be on the use of a new type of fibre optic strainmeters, tiltmeters, pseudolites (terrestrial transmitter of GPS-like signals),and a ground based radar interferometry system. A methodology will be developed for a design of multi-sensor monitoring surveys using deterministic modeling of deformation.

"The dynamics of pollutant and sediment transports in inland and coastal waters are highly anisotropic with a tendency to two-dimensionality. The energy cascade, the reverse of the cascade, or a combination of both, between the 2D horizontal turbulence and small-scale 3D turbulence of distinct length scales are subjects of much interest, since the seminal work of Kraichnan (1967) on 2D turbulence. Laboratory data are needed to support not only the theoretical works but also the development of models. The Earth's rotation is a deciding factor in the large-scale exchanges. The small scale mixings across interfaces by turbulence are dependent on stability/instability of the density/gravity stratification. Research has been conducted by the applicant, his research associates and graduate students to study these 2D and 3D transport processes of very different time and length scales. Wind, wave and current effects on the processes are considered. The erosion and deposition of sediments are part of the study. The focus of the research has been on the fundamentals of modeling, and the verification of the models through laboratory and field studies. The research over the last six years has led to (i) the publication of 1 book, 1 book chapter, 1 book review, 1 editorial, 4 M.Eng. theses, 3 Ph.D. thesis and 43 papers, (ii) the development of instrumentation and data acquisition technique for velocity, temperature, salinity and tracer-concentration measurements, and (iii) the implementation of numerical methods for model simulations of turbulent flow. Future research will continue on the fundamentals. Greater emphasis of the research will be placed in the studying of the small-scale processes. Currently, a new channel is under construction for the planned study of the coastal erosion by waves and currents. The ongoing experiments in the wide channel for the large-scale exchanges will broaden to include cases of very large convective Froude number. The validation of the simulation models by experimental data will continue. The numerical effort will include the implementation of TVD schemes for the control of numerical oscillations, and the further development of a robust numerical method using the blocks as the computational elements.

"Canadian cancer incident rates indicate that one in every 2.5 Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetime and half will die from the disease. Recent studies concerning carcinogenetic cytotoxic drugs in the workplace (including BC health authorities) have found that work surfaces remain contaminated even after prescribed cleaning procedures have been carried out. Occupational exposure to these drugs is associated with various adverse health effects including organ toxicities, reproductive problems, tumors and cancer. The anticipated result of this research is the realization of an effective air monitoring method to determine the effectiveness of current control measures within BC health authority facilities.

 

Even very low doses of some of these drugs may induce cancer, yet an accurate and sensitive monitoring technique is currently unavailable to protect healthcare workers from daily airborne exposure. It has been shown that aerosolized drugs can be carried throughout central air systems, exposing not only workers who directly handle cytotoxic drugs, but all other hospital personnel and visitors. My own research found drug amounts as high as 0.0042 ng/cm2 in an administration area where no cytotoxic drug were prepared or administered.

 

Effective planning and implementation of policies to prevent occupational exposure to cytotoxic drugs requires a thorough understanding of how contamination occurs and subsequently spreads within a workplace environment. With the direct involvement of health authorities, this developed air sampling method can be used to determine the effectiveness of the current exposure control plans. This evidence-based approach is necessary to determine an appropriate drug aerosol reduction plan and implement associated policy changes.",Environnement,Environnement,Interdisciplinary,1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"Posttranscriptional gene regulation determines the amount of protein produced by affecting mRNA stability and translation. This process is essential for cells to adapt and survive in changing environments.  The Pumilio (Puf) protein family are key regulators that interact directly with a subset of mRNAs to induce their turnover and repress their translation.  However, our understanding of how these proteins function remains limited.  Our goal is to apply a powerful combination of genetics, cell biology, biochemistry and functional genomics in the fission yeast model system to elucidate Puf protein function in specific environmental conditions by the determination of their mRNA targets, mode of posttranscriptional control and protein partners.  Our view is that this research will lead to novel mechanistic insights in the posttranscriptional regulation of genes in the cell's response to the environment.  Because the function of genes is highly conserved from yeast to humans, these studies should be relevant in approach and content to human biology.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"The long-term and broad goal of my research program is to better understand the mechanisms underlying sensory and perceptual contributions to the preparation and execution of goal-directed movements. Over the past several years, one research theme has been directed toward issues pertaining to the contributions of vision to conscious perception and control of visually-guided movement. Our visual system serves a dual purpose. First, it allows us to consciously perceive our surroundings (e.g., recognize our cup of coffee). Second, it can guide our interaction with our environment (e.g., reach for our cup of coffee). The short-term goals of this research theme on vision over the next 5 years are to examine the properties of visual-motor processing in the absence of conscious awareness. We will investigate the extent to which unconscious processes can influence motor preparation and real-time control of visually-guided movements. A second research theme on vision has been directed toward issues pertaining to the interactions between visual input and information from the vestibular system (a system that provides us with balance and navigation signals) during goal-directed movements. The short-term goals of this research theme over the next grant period are to study how visual input is combined with navigational signals from our vestibular system to guide locomotion and reaching movements. We will investigate how the weighting between visual and vestibular signals change as a function of the reliability and accuracy of these signals during the preparation and execution of purposeful movements.",Psychologie,"Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"The main object of the proposed research is to develop new processes for chemical and petroleum industries by combining reaction with separation. The processes under consideration require lower capital investment and are more energy efficient, thus less greenhouse and pollutant emissions. Two of the areas to be studied include catalytic distillation (CD) and membrane reactor by hydrogen separation. In the former case, continuous removal of products by distillation eliminates the constraints imposed by the equilibrium of the reaction.

Overall energy consumption is also reduced due to the fact that heat of reaction can supply energy that is required for distillation. Typical examples are production of isopropanol by hydration of propylene and drying of ethanol by introducing isobutylene to react with water which is present in the ethanol feed stocks. In the case of membrane reactor, hydrogen from reaction mixtures can be removed electrochemically with a proton conducting membrane developed in our fuel cell program. Continuous removal of hydrogen in a dehydrogenation process (normally low equilibrium conversion) such as propane to propylene and ethyl benzene to styrene allows much higher conversion and thus avoids the recycle of reactants. The applicant proposes to conduct fundamental study of mass transfer and catalysis in a CD column and membrane reactor, preparation and characterization of catalysts, kinetics and mechanism for the intended reactions. The feasibility can then be carried out for those processes showing promising results. Once patent protection is obtained, funding from industry will be sought to support pilot plant studies.

"Executive function refers to a set of component cognitive control operations that are necessary for performing everyday tasks involving planning, organising, and generating novel problem-solving strategies. Components of executive function include attention, working memory and response inhibition. Failures in executive function have been associated with chronic exposure to stress and fatigue but also with normal aging and in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. A better understanding of the neurobiology of executive function will not only advance our understanding of the abnormal mind, but also that of a cognitively impaired ""healthy"" mind.

    )	The prefrontal cortex is thought to mediate executive function. In rats, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is involved in aspects of inhibitory control whereas the dorsomedial prefrontal is critical for attention and memory functions. It has been suggested, however, that executive function also depends on the integrity of the hippocampus and the successful interaction of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Indeed, the ventral- and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices are major recipients of ventral hippocampal projections. This anatomical organisation suggests that the dorsal and ventral prefrontal-hippocampal networks may make relatively specific contributions to executive function. 

    )	This research program involves a series of experiments designed to examine the behavioural effects of surgical disconnections of the ventral- and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the ventral hippocampus on tests of executive function. The results of these experiments should reveal functionally distinct prefrontal-hippocampal networks involved in executive function: a ventral network that is important for behavioural inhibition and a dorsal network that is specific to attention and working memory function. This information will advance our understanding of the contribution of prefrontal-hippocampal circuits to executive function and facilitate our understanding of the functional organisation of the human brain.

Although the wood industry is already a mainstay of the Canadian economy, revenues are too narrowly based on products for construction of low-rise residential buildings. Accelerating worldwide urbanization of populations requires construction of mid-rise buildings in

inner cities and provides great opportunity for broadening the markets for wood products. Relative to other materials, wood products have many advantages for mid-rise urban construction. These include reduced construction time; lighter weight, which minimises cost on foundation; and being a 'green' carbon-neutral, low production energy option. Expansion into mid-rise and non-residential building market is viewed by the wood

industry and construction professionals as the best means of maintaining the dominant position of two of the nation's crucial industries and of developing export opportunities. Recent changes to building codes focus on presenting expected performance levels in buildings, instead of laying down prescriptive rules for how buildings are built. This gives designers more opportunity to apply advanced design and construction concepts

and methods, and to use materials differently. Advantages of this are illustrated by, for example, the construction of a modern 6-storey wood frame building in Canada during 2009. The proposed research network will create advanced technologies and technical tools that accelerate further developments in wood products and construction industries. NEWBuildS will investigate the use of traditional light-weight wood frame methods in mid-rise construction for residential, as well as heavier systems built with timber products and innovative approaches that combine wood with other materials to create hybrid systems. Around 40 Canadian researchers with expertise in architectural, structural, fire, serviceability, acoustic, and durability aspects of building design and performance will conduct leading research, to provide solutions that meet the needs of 

society, sustain key industries and train high level experts of tomorrow.

"All photosynthetic organisms perform a common biological process referred to as photosynthesis to convert atmospheric CO2 into organic products essential for all other forms of life. In terrestrial plants, three common modes of photosynthesis, C3, C4 and Crassulacean acid metabolism, have been identified with C4 plants being the most efficient under CO2 limiting conditions. It has long been accepted that the operation of C4 photosynthesis requires cooperation of two photosynthetic cell types called Kranz anatomy, which differ in ultrastructure and biochemistry. This paradigm was recently broken with the discovery that three members of the family Chenopodiaceae conduct C4 photosynthesis within individual cells. These species achieve novel solutions for the operation of the C4 photosynthetic mechanism within a single cell through spatial partitioning of organelles and photosynthetic enzymes into two subcellular domains. Therefore, these unique species provide ideal model systems with which to probe regulation of complex structural and functional polarity in a single plant cell. 

The long-term goal of my research program is to characterize the mechanisms responsible for the development and maintenance of single-cell C4 photosynthesis. This will be addressed through a cross-disciplinary approach which combines biochemical, cellular, molecular and physiological techniques. My immediate objectives are to determine: (1) the subcellular patterns of expression of photosynthetic genes, (2) the role of the cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton-associated proteins in the development of single-cell C4 systems, (3) whether key metabolic enzymes possess similar biochemical properties as the Kranz system, and (4) overall efficiency of the single-cell C4 systems. Knowledge of the mechanisms that control photosynthetic gene expression and metabolites partitioning in these single-cell C4 species may allow for the introduction of C4-like characteristics into C3 crops, producing C3-C4 intermediates with minimum photorespiratory losses and improved carbon assimilation efficiency for food production and for industrial applications.

"The objective of the program is to understand the factors governing the development of alluvial river morphology, amongst which sediment transport is paramount. Four styles of work provide complementary results and allow students freedom to select their style of work: (1) flume experiments on sediment transport and the development of sedimentary structures; (2) field measurements of sediment transport; (3) long term studies of river response to sediment transfer; and (4) theory about river and landscape evolution.

We have made experimental studies of gravel transport and the structural arrangement of gravel stream beds for many years. In the next grant period we will conduct collaborative experiments with the French laboratory CEMAGREF, where similar work has been undertaken using very simple mixtures of artificial materials. We intend to apply the physical insight gained from the French studies to deepen understanding of the structure of real stream beds. The experiments will be compared with ongoing field measurements in a highly instrumented, small gravel stream near Vancouver.

Field measurements of sediment transport and sedimentation in lower Fraser River will be continued, as will the periodic survey of Peace River (now a 40-year data set) that tracks the response of the river to dam construction in the 1960s. We will also examine the possibility that 20th century sedimentation in Fraser River is largely a legacy of 19th century placer mining.

These studies provide context for theoretical studies of river channel stability based on regime theory, and studies of sediment transport models. We seek to extend the latter models to understand river basin development within the past 10 000 years.

"Planning and scheduling problems are solved by methods of combinatorial optimization. These fall mainly in one of two categories: local search heuristics and so-called (for the contrast) exact algorithms.  The umbrella of local search comprises heuristics aimed at quickly finding a reasonably good solution. Starting from such a solution, the exact algorithms proceed, often through a lot of hard work, to find the best solution and to prove that it is indeed the best. Heuristics have been the subject of intensive study by researchers in constraint satisfaction programming (often classified under ""artifical intelligence""); exact algorithms have been the subject of intensive study by researchers in mathematical programming (often classified under ""operations research"").  Recent years have seen increasing interaction between these two initially separate communities, but the gap is still far from closed.



Many exact algorithms begin by splitting a problem into two or more subproblems,  which are then solved separately. Branching rules are directions for choosing the split. Branching right is imperative for the efficiency of the overall solution process. The first part of the proposal aims to take a step towards a better understanding of branching strategies.



The second part of the proposal concerns refinements and testing of a combinatorial optimization algorithm called resolution search. This algorithm has been designed to 

mitigate the harmful effect of bad branching decisions. In addition, it can act as a vehicle for bridging the gap between the heuristic algorithms and the exact algorithms.","Production et gestion des op�rations","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Computing and Information Sciences - B",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"As consequence of major technical advances in computing and in molecular biology, huge databases of biomedical interest are now available. In order to take advantage of the potential information they contain, new methods of data analysis are needed. One challenging aspect of the effort required, is that data are available at virtually all levels of observation: social, psychological, clinical, systemic and molecular. There is a growing need of synthesis and it is increasingly recognized that it is essential to link distinct levels of observation to improve understanding. The new methods of data analysis that seem to be appropriate for the task are considered intelligent, i.e. able to mimic as much as possible the thinking of human experts. They borrow substantially from the discipline known as machine learning, but with specific attention to problems of statistical inference and to practical needs, such as dealing in real time with huge data sets. Indeed, relatively new terms have been created in the last 15-20 years, such as data mining and statistical learning theory. 

In my work I attempt to fully exploit the parallelism between the cognitive strategies of an expert and some computer-based tasks of data analysis. Highlights of my current and future work include: 1) Tree-growing algorithms based on statistical models for increasingly complex data structures, e.g. data from multi-level systems. 2) Neural Network architectures based on statistical models. 3) Pattern discovery (clustering) for multilevel data and other complex data structures, both in an exploratory and in a model based mode. 4) Latent class models to explain complex dynamical patterns in observed variables via simpler dynamics of underlying conceptual entities.

"Wetlands will make up 20-40% of the landscape restored after mining for oil sands in NE Alberta. Previous collaboration has helped us understand effects of mine tailings & process waters on composition of these communities but not on their function. Wetlands built with tailings become vegetated and productive in a few years, but predicted times needed for natural (reference-like) processes/conditions to develop and remain productive are unconfirmed. Natural wetlands slowly accumulate carbon (C) from algae & aquatic plants, and terrestrial inputs. Adding peat or topsoil is thought to accelerate and promote community development. Hydrocarbons in tailings (bitumen) and process water (naphthenic acids) are initially toxic, but may provide additional C after bacterial digestion We will document how building wetlands with tailings alters maturation

in a reclaimed landscape, explaining -how the types of biomass entering the food web change as wetlands age; -how this influences community development, food web structure & complexity, and the viability & production of top predators (fish, amphibians, tree swallows) -whether topsoil-amended wetlands will remain productive and sequester C (eventually becoming peat lands); or whether the C will be released as greenhouse gases. We will develop indicators (calibrated indices, risk assessments) that measure reclamation success, and recommend the materials and strategies most effective and economical at producing a self-sustaining landscape. We will model C pathways/budgets to assess how the allocation & flow among food web compartments changes with age. This will aid understanding of the processes controlling early succession. Our studies will also help to predict Canada's greenhouse gas contributions as oil sands mining expands to its full capacity over 80 y. This will be enormously important in determining Canada's capacity to meet its commitments and to moderate

expected effects of climate change in the face of increasing world oil demand.",Environnement,Environnement,University/Industry,2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Ontario,Ontario

"The high-speed camera will be used to support diverse research projects in the department of mechanical engineering at Queen's University. This high tech piece of equipment is beyond the funding available to any single researcher in the department. Dr. G. Ciccarelli will use the camera to study hydrogen explosion safety related to the future use of hydrogen as the primary energy carrier. The main concern is the accidental release of hydrogen in a confined space like an underground parking garage or tunnel. Ignition of a hydrogen-air mixture in this environment can produce very high overpressures that can cause serious damage to surrounding structures, and most importantly can result in mass casualties. Dr. A. Pollard is studying cavitation of gas, or vapour bubble formation within a liquid, and the dynamics of the surface of bubble and its resulting collapse.  Dr. M. Birk is investigating the evaporative water spray cooling in gas turbine exhaust systems for marine applications. The project involves experimentation and computational fluid dynamics of swirling hot gas flows in bent ducts and ejectors with water spray. Experiments will be conducted with large scale high temperature air flows to study the characteristics of the evaporating spray flows. This camera represents the state-of-the-art in digital visualization and will permit quantitative data to be extracted that are not overshadowed by errors. Students who will use the camera and post-process these data will have a significant advantage: the images obtained will be notable, and they will form the backbone to their theses and publications in leading journals in their field.

"The proposed research program will be carried out in the field of industrial explosion safety. Explosions in the chemical process industry are common, costing the industry millions of dollars every year for plant repair, lost revenue and litigation. Even more important is the loss of life that occurs all too often with large industrial explosions. An example of a gas-phase explosion that was thoroughly covered by the media occurred this past August at the Sunrise Propane depot in Toronto. The objective of this work is to obtain a thorough understanding of explosion physics so that such explosions can be prevented. Ultra high-speed digital video cameras with megapixel resolution permit the visualization of an explosion front propagating up to a speed of 2,000 metres per second. Experiments will be performed in a square cross-section channel equipped with glass sidewalls in order to visualize the propagation of the explosion front that is ignited at one end of the channel. The explosion front initially consists of a flame, but as it accelerates to speeds in excess of the speed of sound of the explosive mixture a shock wave forms ahead of the flame. It is the large pressure increase associated with the shock wave that causes the structural damage. A special technique, known as schlieren photography, will be used to capture the evolution of the explosion front as it propagates the length of the channel. Students involved in the project will learn how to set up the photographic system and analyze the data obtained from the experiment. The numerical modeling of high speed explosion propagation remains a major challenge due to the large disparity in the spatial and temporal scales of the various fluid dynamic and combustion phenomena involved. However, as a result of recent major advancements in computing power, simulations of this complex phenomenon are now within reach. In parallel with the experiments, computational fluid dynamics modeling will be carried using the High Performance Computing Virtual Laboratory at Queen's University to simulate the explosion process. The experimental visualization data will be used to validate the numerical predictions. This program will provide training to two doctoral and two Masters students.

"The integrated utilization of biological reactors and membrane filtration devices (MBRs) holds great potential for wastewater treatment and environmental reclamation, as they are able to produce high quality water while treating high organic strength wastewater. A number of very promising areas of application of MBRs, however, remain largely unexplored and require further investigation. These include treatment of wastewater from livestock operations and food processing industries, and removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), personal care products, and pesticides. Future, stricter discharge standards for these groups of chemicals will drive the implementation of technologies that are able to reduce their concentrations to regulated levels. New wastewater treatment technologies, which can be integrated into various treatment sequences and novel process streams, will need to be developed and evaluated for these applications. 

   The proposed research aims to determine the fate of EDCs in the treatment of municipal wastewater by MBRs. Although overall removal efficiencies in MBRs of specific type of EDCs, particularly estrogens and nonyl-phenols, have been reported in literature, the relative contributions of biodegradation, adsorption to mixed liquor solids, and membrane filtration have not been identified. This is primarily due to the challenges associated with analyzing solid-bound EDCs in activated sludge and the complex interrelationship between biological activity and physical separation. This study aims to establish removal mechanisms and kinetics of specific estrogens in MBRs. An effective extraction method for EDCs from activated sludge solids will be developed for this purpose. In order to capture potentially estrogenic metabolites or degradation end-products, overall estrogenic activity will be measured at various points in the process using a recombinant yeast assay. As part of this research, the impact of MBR operating parameters such as hydraulic and solid retention time, organic loading, and permeate flux on EDC removal will be evaluated. Furthermore, the potential of enhancing EDC removal by using a hybrid MBR with powdered activated carbon (PAC) dosing will be investigated.

"Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic studies of sedimentary basins have proven to be significant sources of information on subjects as diverse as the origin of ore deposits, the development of reversal time scales and past climate variation. As such, the importance of understanding the geologic and environmental processes that have created, modified and destroyed specific magnetization components within a basin cannot be overstated.  The applicant's previous paleomagnetic and rock magnetic studies have focused on Ordovician- Mississippian carbonates of the Williston Basin in central North America.  Such carbonates have provided significant information; however, they typically have weak natural magnetizations, and carry one or more secondary magnetizations that may or may not be associated with specific diagenetic events. To complicate matters even further, if the secondary magnetization is unrecognized, our understanding of the processes that occur in the basins may be affected.  The studies proposed are aimed at reducing and constraining these complications, even as they continue to examine the traditional hypotheses on the origins of remagnetizations in sedimentary rocks, investigate remanence acquisition mechanisms, and evaluate some additional possible factors in remagnetization. Three new approaches to the long term objectives are being proposed: the past paleomagnetic studies of the Williston and Western Canada Sedimentary Basins will be extended to younger, clastic rocks (Cretaceous Viking Formation and equivalents), experimental investigations on the potential for fluid / temperature interaction effects on remanence acquistion and potentially remagnetization will be conducted; and a close examination of the impact of specific diagenetic events on magnetization will be performed.  These studies will allow continued construction of a continental-scale synthesis and database of the distribution of remagnetizations in the Williston and Western Canada Sedimentary Basins that aims to evaulate the controlling factors on remagnetization and remanence acquisition in sedimentary basins.

During embryonic development, an unassuming ball of cells becomes patterned and shaped into a recognizable human form. My lab is interested in understanding the molecular and genetic events that control this incredible transformation, and use zebrafish as a genetic organism for study. In the last decade, intense scientific research has developed the aquarium fish Danio rerio (zebrafish) into a valuable experimental organism for modeling and studying human embryonic development and disease - although you can't watch a child growing inside its mother, you can study a fish as it proceeds through embryogenesis. Zebrafish embryos are abundant, transparent and easily grown under a microscope - this allows us to actually watch embryonic development occur at a cellular, and even a sub-cellular level. Moreover, the patterning events, cell movements, and tissue remodeling that structure the developing embryo are remarkably conserved between zebrafish and humans. Finally, zebrafish are well suited for genetic screens, and we have isolated mutations in genes that disrupt normal embryogenesis. Here, we employ cell biology, embryological manipulation, and classic genetic approaches in zebrafish to determine what genes are required for embryogenesis, and how these genes control fundamental processes that drive embryonic development.

"The instrument we propose (CD/ORD/Fluorescence spectropolarimeter) is a powerful tool to study biomolecules and these techniques are widely used by researchers to characterize proteins, natural products, enzymes and drugs. One of the very important aspects of the research involving these techniques is the determination of the structure of proteins. The three dimensional structure of proteins determines their vital activity; any alteration of their structure can have serious medical implications. Fluorescence and Circular Dichroism (CD) are essential tools to characterize, investigate and understand the action of all protein based medicine. 

       CD is a form of light absorption spectroscopy; it is the difference between left- and right-circularly polarized light. Typically this difference is very small and very sensitive equipment is needed to measure it. 

       Purity testing of optically active natural products is also an important function that the instrument required will perform. It is clear that this instrument is essential to conduct high quality research on biomolecules but it is also a very high performance spectroscopic instrument. Because of its central location in the chemistry department it will be accessible to all our research personnel and it will be intensively used to investigate fundamental problems in many other areas of chemistry as well.

"In high-impact fields such as the oil and gas and nuclear industries, the consequences of failures can be catastrophic.  My work involves the development of magnetic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques to detect areas of localized high strain which threaten the integrity and safe operation of engineering systems.  Techniques based on magnetism are the best suited to strain measurement, since other methods (e.g. eddy current, ultrasonic) are much less strain sensitive.  However, the correlation between magnetic behaviour and strain is very complex in engineering materials and not well understood.   This Discovery grant funding will further my long term goals of understanding and exploiting the magnetic response of strain in ferromagnetic engineering materials.

     The Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) and Magnetic Barkhausen Noise (MBN) techniques are well suited to strain measurement. MFL is used to find defects in oil and gas pipelines, but further development is necessary to adapt it for locating high-strain regions such as dents and gouges.  MBN is a leading candidate for finding stressed regions in the steel feeder tubes used in CANDU reactors, but there are many practical obstacles to its use.   The proposed grant will fund three projects: The first examines the relationship between magnetic behaviour and ""intergranular"" strain (strain in a particular crystallographic direction). The second study aims to characterize and understand the magnetic response of severely plastically deformed steels, enabling us to recognize the magnetic ""signature"" of dents and gouges.  The third aspect of the Discovery-grant funded work will look at some of the engineering aspects in adapting MBN probes to use in industry.  

    Finally, mine is the only university-based group in Canada to provide students with training and experience in magnetics engineering.  This training is extremely important in the science-based economic sector, and my graduates have found immediate employment in Canada's high-tech, oil and gas, and nuclear industries.

"The completion of the human genome sequence has provided us with a wealth of data about the number, types, and organization of the genes required to encode a human. Functional analysis of the genomes of other organisms, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, is also being done to try to make sense of the human genome. Comparisons of these different genomes will also help us to determine how genomes of all organisms evolved.

   Current theories of genome evolution include the concept that new genes arise by a process of gene duplication. Gene duplication can occur by different processes, including doubling of the whole genome, duplication of a part of a chromosome, or copying of a single gene. Once a gene is duplicated, one of the copies can be inactivated or, in rare cases, it can acquire a new function by a change in its DNA, or mutation.  It is thought new functions of duplicated genes are an important force in the diversification of life.  Another source of genetic diversity comes from virus-like sequences, called retrotransposons, found in our genome and those of other organisms.  These sequences copy themselves and insert into other sites of the genome.  However, they can also make copies of gene products which insert into new sites.  This type of gene duplication is called retroduplication.  The patterns of their evolution and the mechanism of their production aren't yet well defined.

   Now that we have several genome sequences in hand, we can ask 1) what parts of retroduplicated genes changed by mutation? 2) do retroduplicated genes have the same or different functions?  3) if a retroduplicated gene acquires mutations that knock out its original function, can it have a new function?  4) what are the mechanisms for retroduplication?  This research program will address these questions using the Drosophila genome and genes from other insect species. Computer analysis of gene sequences and the tools of genetics and molecular biology will be used to answer these questions. The answers will help us to understand the process of how genes diversify in function and its significance for organismal evolution.

"An ecosystem is a community of organisms that interact with each other and with their surroundings. Given an adequate understanding of these interactive processes, ecosystems can be created and managed to provide specific services. Some microbial ecosystems, for instance, provide useful services such as composting, and agricultural ecosystems are managed to provide food. Ecosystems that are engineered to incorporate natural processes are more sustainable because they are driven more by renewable inputs such as sunlight, and therefore depend less on nonrenewable inputs such as fossil fuels. The dynamics of natural ecosystems are extremely complex, however, and so the application of ecological theory to engineer ecosystems for specific purposes is still rudimentary. In this research, microbial ecosystems will be constructed in the form of pilot-scale compost vessels. The vessels will be instrumented to allow automated measurement of process parameters such as temperature, airflow, relative humidity, and the composition of inlet and exhaust gases. A computer interface will allow this information to be used in the development of advanced numerical models of the interrelated physical, chemical, and microbial aspects of the composting process. Finally, a feedback control system will use these models to control the process parameters and optimize the system for specific goals, such as reduced noxious or greenhouse gas emissions or increased processing rate. The ultimate objective in this research program is to use these pilot-scale systems to test ecological hypotheses, and to learn how to better apply ecological theory in the engineering of systems that include living organisms. The students that work on this research will become highly skilled in the real-time characterization, modeling, and control of microbial ecosystems. The knowledge that they gain will also be applicable to the understanding and engineering of other kinds of ecological systems, improving the sustainability of ecosystems of all scales that provide critical services to society, such as the production of food, fibre, and energy, and the cleansing of water and air.

"Ammonium and nitrate contamination of groundwaters from septic field effluents, manure stockpiles, and fertilizers represents the most ubiquitous and persistent threat to water quality in rural watersheds. However, through transformation to N2 both are rendered benign. This is achieved by anaerobic ammonium oxidation, mediated though the activity of anammox bacteria. This important reaction was discovered only some fifteen years ago and is now recognized as a critical step in the global nitrogen cycle in the oceans, wastewaters and soils. Our preliminary work suggests that this reaction also occurs in groundwaters. Our objectives are to determine the occurrence of this important reaction pathway in ammonium-contaminated groundwaters, determine the isotope fractionation effects associated with the anammox reaction for its detection, and develop methods to stimulate the reaction for in-situ remediation of groundwaters. 

We will first research anammox reactions in impacted groundwaters (Project 1), looking at a number of sites where ammonia contamination is problematic and for which preliminary studies show conditions conducive to anammox. All will be sampled for anammox microbiological activity using complementary techniques including Polymerized Chain Reaction (PCR) and Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH). Anammox strains will be then used to innoculate microcosm experiments in Project 2 to establish isotope fractionation and rates during anammox reaction. This project will examine the effect of anammox reaction on the isotopes of N and O in ammonium and nitrate as tracers. Finally, Progam 3 will develop the anammox reaction in expe- riments for a reactive barrier, where this intriguing reaction can be harnessed to attenuate ammonium and nitrate in contami- nated groundwaters.

"Canada's cryosphere constitutes roughly one half of its land mass, and is underlain by perennially frozen terrain - permafrost - that completely alters the mechanisms we know to govern water movement through watersheds in temperate landscapes. Groundwater movement through unfrozen zones in permafrost is an important component of the Arctic hydrological cycle, as it provides base flow for fish spawning habitat. It is involved in the formation of endostromatolites, biomineralizations that hold paleoclimate information as well as information on life in  extreme environments. Long-term impacts of groundwater in talik include effects on nuclear waste repositories and on mining in the north.



Research in Arctic hydrogeology and paleoclimatology requires travel to remote regions of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Our work in these remote regions involves the use of isotopes and geochemistry, natural tracers of water movement, that we measure in samples collected throughout the year. This application will support field work in the Arctic that involves new research collaborators and assistants from the north. It also involves graduate and undergraduate students, who will gain tremendous experience from their research in Canada's north.

"The cryosphere constitutes roughly one half of Canada's land mass, and is underlain by perennially frozen terrain - permafrost - that greatly alters the mechanisms we know to govern water movement through watersheds in temperate landscapes. Groundwater movement through talik (unfrozen) zones in permafrost is an important component of the Arctic hydrological cycle, as it provides base flow for fish spawning habitat. It is involved in the formation of endostromatolites, biomineralizations that hold paleoclimate information as well as information on life in extreme environments. Long-term impacts of groundwater in talik also include effects on mining in the north and on nuclear waste repositories over the scale of glacial/interglacial cycles. While little is known about the role of groundwater in the north today, even less is understood about its role under past Arctic climates.



The challenge of Arctic hydrogeology and paleohydrogeology is in the development of new research approaches that elucidate changes to groundwater flow systems under changing climates, past, present and future. Our work in this vast and remote region relies on the use of isotopes and geochemistry, which are natural tracers of water. When measured in minerals and sediments, these tools provide information on past climates. Our laboratory capabilities have greatly expanded over the past three years to include new and exciting analytical capabilities. Together with Discovery Grant support, my work embarks upon a new phase of Arctic research involving new students and collaborators, making new discoveries in Arctic hydrogeology and paleoclimatology.

"Ecologists are interested in factors affecting survival and reproductive rates of wild animals because these rates reflect the general health of wildlife and have an enormous impact on population size. In Canada, many wildlife species are threatened by environmental changes resulting not only from local developments but also from impacts in other parts of the world. Populations of boreal-breeding lesser scaup have declined and remain well below conservation goals, whereas species like tree swallows are of conservation concern because of decreasing population trends in species that rely heavily on aerial insects for food. Our recent results suggest that new work is urgently needed on the life-cycle period from hatching to independence (or first breeding), so new Discovery Grant projects are designed to clarify why late-hatched offspring typically have lower survival than early-hatched individuals. This pattern could be related to seasonal reductions in parental quality or food abundance, or higher incidence and severity of diseases. Innovative experiments combined with long-term field data on tree swallows and lesser scaup will help to pinpoint the most likely explanation. 

   Determining why these patterns exist will also help to guide programs designed to benefit these and related species of conservation concern. Two additional projects will focus on factors influencing breeding habitat selection in birds.  In theory, individuals should select areas where survival or reproductive rates are highest, but this relation is often ignored or not found in studies of wild birds. Habitat selection and breeding success will be linked using unique data for free-ranging mallards on the Canadian prairies.  Novel experiments will also be performed to determine whether tree swallows learn nest site preferences from early experience or due to genetic predisposition. Overall, new studies will: (i) clarify basic processes affecting survival rates and breeding success, (ii) apply this knowledge to enhance the cost-effectiveness of conservation programs, and (iii) provide a stimulating, productive place for training young Canadians, individuals who will be required in future to deal with increasingly complex environmental challenges.

"Frazil ice is defined as small, thin particles of ice that are formed in turbulent water when its temperature drops below 0�C.  One of the properties of frazil ice is that it adheres to nearly all submerged objects.  This can cause the blockage of hydroelectric generating stations and water intakes.  Frazil can also stick to the underside of an icecover as well as the river bottom, thereby increasing energy losses along a river and reducing revenue for hydroelectric companies.  Combined, the problems associated with frazil ice results in significant economic losses for the national economy each year.



Experimental and field studies have been conducted in the past, however some of the fundamental processes of frazil formation have yet to be studied in detail.  This research will focus in particular on the growth of individual frazil ice crystals as well as the processes of flocculation and secondary nucleation.  These processes are poorly understood, and this study will reveal fundamental information through the use of high resolution digital imagery from laboratory tests conducted in a unique counter-rotating flume.



In addition, results from this study will be used to develop numerical models to describe these processes which will then be implemented into computer programs that model river ice from its formation to breakup.  The CRISSP 2-D computer program will be used to model the upstream reach of the Jenpeg hydroelectric generating station in Northern Manitoba in order to develop a means of improving operational strategies.  The combined contribution of each phase of this research will advance the current state of knowledge and will allow hydroelectric companies and others to improve their operations and reduce economic losses associated with river ice.

"    )	The experimental plan presented in this proposal represents a continuation of studies on the structure-function relationship of glycoside hydrolases conducted in our laboratory over the past 21 years under the auspices of NSERC.  Based on the results of our studies, we hypothesize that the anaerobic rumen bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes organizes its cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes on its cell surface into cellulosome-like complexes and that a soluble factor is released to de-stabilize crystalline cellulose.  To test this hypothesis, we propose to clone and express the genes encoding the three previously unidentified xylanases and cellulases, and the hypothetical 180 kDa and 240 kDa scaffoldins.  Then, we will investigate the association, if any, of these proteins with one another by affinity chromatographic and surface plasmon resonance techniques.  To further investigate the efficiency of cellulose biodegradation by F. succinogenes, we will initiate a search for a factor thought to be released by F. succinogenes for the destabilisation of crystalline cellulose using atomic force and scanning tunnelling microscopy.

    )	We have also been investigating the details of the catalytic mechanism of glycoside hydrolases using the industrially important glucoamylase as a model.  Studies have involved site-directed mutagenesis coupled with chemical modification to replace the catalytic nucleophile carboxylate with a sulfinite group.  We propose to continue these studies by investigating the general applicability of replacing catalytic carboxylates with sulfinite functional groups to enhance the catalytic potential of other glycoside hydrolases, including that of cellulases and cellobiohydrolases.  In addition, we propose  to test the hypothesis regarding the importance of the distance between catalytic carboxyl groups in carbohydrases by attempting to convert the inverting mechanism of a cellulase to that of a retaining enzyme through a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification techniques.  Together, these investigations will provide greater insight into the functioning of cellulolytic enzymes and thereby permit their engineering for more efficient bioconversion.

"The leading aim of our research is to understand the operation of subglacial processes and to apply this understanding to improve computer models of the dynamics and hydrology of ice sheets. Inadequate representation of subglacial processes is a major shortcoming of the models that are currently used to predict Earth's glacial future. We need the best possible estimates of future rates of mass loss from polar ice sheets and the consequent rise in global sea level. Additionally, we need good models to increase understanding of past abrupt climate change events. Our strategy is to install instruments within and beneath glaciers to observe processes and their interactions, develop theory to encapsulate the results of these measurements and build numerical models to simulate the natural systems. We aim to extend the classical theory of subglacial drainage systems, based on water flow through circular ice-walled conduits, to include more realistic geometries. Applying these results, we can immediately improve physical models of subglacial and supraglacial outburst floods and develop, for the first time, a realistic model for eskers (a landscape feature) and, we hope, for other subglacial landforms. At a larger scale, we will continue our research on mechanisms of abrupt climate change, focussing on the role of megafloods, such as that from glacial Lake Agassiz, and on ""Heinrich events"" which seem to involve a coupled instability of water and ice flow. To complement our research on megafloods we will launch a modest field program to study the outburst floods and flood bedforms of Neoglacial Lake Alsek, Yukon.

     The subglacial processes of Hans Glacier, Svalbard, are being studied as part of a Poland-Canada IPY collaboration. The aim is to find evidence for winter-season sensitivity to surface loading (for example by snowfall or rapid changes in air pressure). This strange phenomenon was discovered during our long-term field study of Trapridge Glacier, Yukon, and we wish to determine whether it is a rare or commonplace attribute of healthy glaciers.

"As Canada moves into the 21st century, the demand for natural gas seems to be increasing unabated.  Traditionally, underground natural gas storage has been relied upon to smooth the natural gas supplyand to  meet high peak gas demands.  A potential new means for storing and transportation of natural gas is through its conversion into gas hydrate  form. Gas hydrates are non-stoichiometric crystalline compounds that occur when hydrogen-bonded water  molecules form cavities that can be occupied by a guest molecule such as methane, ethane or propane. Preliminary studies regarding the storage of natural gas in hydrate form have identified several important  factors that need to be addressed before NGH can be an economically feasible means of gas storage. Most  noticeably, it has been recognised that if a gas hydrate storage process is to be practical for industrial  applications, then natural gas must be sequestered in gas hydrates at a rapid rate.  Recently, It has been found  that the rate of hydrate formation could be increased significantly if the host water is a micellar solution  containing a surfactant. However, despite the recognition that surfactants can increase the rate of gas hydrate  formation, very little quantitative experimental data on the  intrinsic kinetics of gas hydrate  formation and decomposition in the presence of surfactants has been generated. This data is vital in the design and optimisation of  any system for storing natural gas in the form of gas hydrates. Thus, I am proposing to undertake an  experimental study to quantify the kinetics of gas hydrate formation and decomposition in the  presence of surfactants and to mathematically model a process for storing natural gas in hydrate form.

"The main aim of this proposal is to increase our understanding of brain activity related to rewarding events and their effects on behaviour. We know that different parts of the brain are specialized for different functions, and the main areas of the brain that are involved in the processing of reward have been identified. Certain neurotransmitters (signalling molecules) have been shown to be important players in this reward process. The best known of these is dopamine. In popular culture, this neurotransmitter is often equated with pleasure. However, evidence suggests that dopamine release has little to do with reward enjoyment; for example, it is often released before a reward is received. Hence, dopamine release may have less to do with pleasure, and more to do with reward anticipation or with motivation to obtain a reward. 

    )	To try to get a better handle on this issue, we intend to study brain mechanisms underlying rat ultrasonic vocalizations. Rats make a variety of sounds beyond the human hearing range.  Some of these are closely tied to the anticipation of rewards (e.g. sex, food, drugs).  These high-frequency calls have not yet been extensively studied, and we want to find out how they relate to other measures of reward studied in animals. We also wish to find out how these vocalizations are related to the release of dopamine in the brain. 

    )	Since reward mechanisms appear to be organized in a similar way in the brains of humans and rats, these studies should ultimately tell us something about the human condition.

"Remote sensing, the science of aerial or satellite data capture, provides crucial information for such important endeavours as smart agricultural practices, shipping in northern waters, and monitoring of greenhouse gases. Vast amounts of data are generated, and computer-based algorithms to interpret the data are urgently needed. 



For example, using the Canadian RADARSAT satellite, the Canadian Ice Service manually interprets 4000 scenes annually, providing ice type maps over huge regions that infer ice thickness and strength to facilitate decision support systems for shipping and icebreaking. There is a demand for machine algorithms that can process this imagery. My particular interest is the automated interpretation of this radar-based sea ice imagery, considered the ""holy grail"" of remote sensing problems. 

 

My research team has made significant advances toward this objective by using an operator's coarse map as a starting point to drive an automated solution. For example, whereas the manual coarse interpretation would indicate a region as containing 30% thick ice, our sensor-resolution solution would pinpoint the thick ice location. Our prototype has demonstrated strong initial success accounting for disparate features such as tone, texture, and floe shape while handling the extensive temporal and spatial radar imagery variations.

 

The detailed maps we generate are expected to be a necessity for ship navigation in hazardous waters (to improve safety and save time and fuel) and to provide input into regional climate models. Other northern nations would be interested in purchasing maps derived from the proposed algorithm. My NSERC-enabled research in texture understanding, image segmentation, and cognitive interpretation required to solve this problem has also been and will continue to be successfully applied to other domains.

"Polymers are ubiquitous, and are expected to be able to replace traditional structural materials for many applications. For this purpose, it is necessary to generate new polymeric materials based on the narrow set of building blocks (monomers) which are easily accessible to the chemist. In this proposal, we intend to combine the simplest building blocks (ethylene and simple polar monomers) in an innovative manner, so as to generate entirely novel polymeric materials.  Thus, we propose to explore the copolymerization of ethylene with polar monomers catalyzed by late transition metal complexes.  A novel family of polymers will be prepared by the catalytic copolymerization of ethylene with acrylic esters, acrylic acid and acrylamides. The cyclopolymerization of allyl acrylate will be scrutinized, and amphiphilic copolymers ethylene and acrylamide will be prepared with the goal to generate self-assembled nanostructures in water.

"Ion channels are proteins that form ion-selective pores within cell membranes. They control membrane excitability and are therefore critical determinants of cellular function. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, which are a very diverse family of ion channel, are highly selective for potassium ions (K+) and open (gates) in response to changes in the voltage across the cell membrane. Despite their critical role in regulating excitability in cardiac, nerve, and endocrine cells, dynamic structural information regarding key Kv channel gating mechanisms is lacking. 



I will use a new fluorescence technique to study the protein motions that cause Kv channels to gate. This involves the attachment of a fluorescent probe directly to the channel protein. Because the fluorescent probe is sensitive to its surroundings, the light it emits changes when the protein moves. This provides a direct report of movements that occur within the channel as it opens and closes. The technique allows simultaneous recording of changes in the fluorescent light from the probe and the electrical current passing through the channel as it opens. This provides a comprehensive way to study channel gating in real time. 



This fluorescence-based technique is a cutting-edge application, and only a handful of researchers worldwide are able to perform these fluorescence experiments to study ion channel gating. The technique provides a direct and real time report of channel movements that occur during gating. These experiments will provide a comprehensive and unparalleled view of channel function and the results will greatly extend our understanding of how channels function and how this is modulated by the cellular environment.

"The applicant proposes to continue research in the field of Applied Mechanics.  The research will pursue the study of the flexibility of members used in mechanical devices such as mechanisms, robots and micro-machines.

  In the trend toward increased speeds of mechanical devices and machinery, consequential increases in dynamic forces cause deviations in the dimensions of mechanism elements; these changes often become

critical. Forces and changes in the dimensions must be determined with high accuracy. The research will devise more accurate means of obtaining these data. Some studies will involve the finite element method. New finite elements specifically suited to analyses of such machines will be developed. This will enable analysis of a wider variety of machine components. Introduction of enhanced mathematical models will reduce the cost of building and testing highly expensive prototypes of preliminary designs. Concurrently, the research  will provide opportunities for the training of several graduate students who can be trained in the latest techniques for the analysis of mechanical systems.

  Some of the current and proposed research will deal with enhancement of the design and fabrication of micro electromechanical systems (MEMS), as small as 60 microns in size. The device now used to perform this assembly has some similarities to modern day robots. However, a unique feature in the design is that the gripper is fabricated at the micro-scale, and then attached to the far end of the assembly device. It is this micro-gripper that picks up micro-parts for assembly with other parts at the micro-scale. The

assembly techniques will be researched and refined. One of the proposed projects is to carry out background work for the development of an induction device that will create necessary electrical power located onboard the micro-device. Improved MEMS sensors used in the measuring of forces will also be researched. Completion of this research will significantly increase the potential applications of MEMS.

"Throughout Canada alarm is being raised over the potentially rapid loss of native species and habitats to the threat of invasive species.  In response, many efforts are underway to control invasive species, but a scientific understanding of invasive species ecology is clearly lacking.  Two key issues are: 1) failure to comprehend the roles of invasive species within the larger context of restoration ecology and 2) limiting the study of ecological restoration to a small-plot level.  Longer-term research at larger spatial scales is needed to understand invasion ecology in its full complexity, including impacts of grazing and other disturbance types, diverse plant functional types, reproductive ecology, dispersal and seedbanks.  The proposed program to study Garry oak meadows (GOM) on Salt Spring Island is centered on Trinity Western University's Crow's Nest Ecological Research Area (CNERA) which, like most remnant GOM, is dominated by invasive non-native grasses, and thus provides a representative restoration laboratory.  The program builds on 7 years of prior research, and takes the investigation to the next level by fencing off large portions of the GOM at CNERA.  Short-term objectives include: 1) Testing if large exclosures and/or mowing treatments cause greater shifts in plant community composition than observed in smaller scale experiments, 2) Evaluating if planting of Garry oak meadow forbs significantly enhances restoration potential, 3) Testing whether Douglas-fir removal promotes Garry oak native community structure, and 4) Evaluating whether Propertius duskywing butterfly populations increase with habitat restoration.



As one of Canada's most endangered ecosystems, the GOM ecosystem provides an ideal testing ground for restoration ecology.  The proposed program is poised to engage in the rigorous ecological research necessary to restore plant communities in the face of growing dominance of invasive species in GOM habitats, and in turn provide wisdom for restoring other invaded ecological communities.

The topics studied in this subfield of condensed matter physics have relevance to possible applications (e.g. nano and quantum electronics, quantum information processing); they are also of fundamental interest, as they often involve the complex interplay of disorder physics, quantum interference and (possibly strong) interparticle interactions.  This proposal deals with topics in two relatively new areas of mesoscopic physics: quantum electro-mechanics and finite-frequency quantum transport.  The first topic (quantum electro-mechanics) involves the study of mesoscopic electronic systems coupled to mechanical resonators (e.g. a single electron transistor coupled to a micron-scale doubly-clamped beam).  The second topic (finite-frequency quantum transport) involves the study of the dynamic response of mesoscopic conductors, as well as their real-time fluctuations.

The significance of the work is in its potential to lead to actual quantum information processing devices that outperform existing devices in various respects, or possibly to discover fundamental reasons why they cannot be realized.

"My proposal is to work on representations of groups. A representation of a group is a concrete realization, using arrays of numbers, to represent groups. Properties of the original groups can be studied using numerical information arising from the representations. Of particular importance are irreducible representations, which are building blocks for  all the representations. The number of inequivalent irreducible representations and their degrees, that is, the sizes of the representing matrices, are of particular interest.","Sciences math�matiques","Avancement des connaissances","Pure & Applied Maths - A",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"That prey should fear predators seems like such a basic biological fact that a world without such fear, where the 'wolf shall dwell with the lamb', appears mythical.  Yet, a lack of fear in prey on islands is coming to be accepted as the only commonality that can explain the devastating effect the introduction of mammalian predators has had on so many species of island prey all around the globe.  Since the ancestors of island prey all presumably 'knew' to fear predators how could this ability be lost?  Heightened alertness is physiologically costly and may adversely affect growth and health.  The benefits to island prey of being able to 'forget' about predators should thus include: less predator-induced stress, improved development, and increased longevity.  Dr. Clinchy will conduct the first integrated study of whether and how fear, physiology, growth and longevity vary with the presence and abundance of predators on islands.  This work will be conducted on a model species of mammalian prey, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), on B.C.'s Gulf Islands archipelago, because the large size of mice on these islands has long been hypothesized to be due to the paucity of predators.  There may now be more medium-sized mammalian predators, or 'mesopredators', such as raccoons (Procyon lotor) and weasels (Mustela erminea), on these islands, than there were 50-100 years ago; in part because the large carnivores that prey on them, such as wolves (Canis lupus), cougars (Puma concolor) and black bears (Ursus americanus), have been extirpated from most of the Gulf Islands; and because these mesopredators were evidently introduced on many islands never inhabited by large carnivores.  Mesopredators may reach extremely high densities on islands, because in addition to having no predators, they have access to abundant inter-tidal food.  Dr. Clinchy's research will also address: these changes is mesopredator abundance; whether these mesopredators have begun to 'forget' about their predators; and what effect this has had on their physiology, growth and health.  In addition to answering fundamental ecological questions, Dr. Clinchy's research will be used in planning an introduced predator mitigation program for the new Gulf Islands National Park Reserve.","Conservation et pr�servation",Environnement,"Evolution & Ecology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"Astronomical observations probing the earliest moments of the big bang are being used to learn about the interactions of subatomic particles at the shortest possible distance scales.  String theory is the only known model which consistently unifies all the fundamental forces of nature.  Although current particle physics experiments do not have enough energy to directly test string theory, we are looking for its imprints on the microwave radiation left over from the big bang.  Our research explores the links between the period of superfast expansion in the early universe, called inflation, and string theory, which could lead to evidence in the cosmic microwave radiation.



In addition, we are exploring ways of explaining the generation of the matter in the universe (the asymmetry between matter and antimatter) moments after the big bang.  Our interest is in theories which can be tested at the soon-to-begin particle accelerator experiment in Geneva, Switzerland, the Large Hadron Collider, which will create conditions in the laboratory which resemble those in the early universe.

"Forests are Canada's most important renewable natural resource, contributing significantly to the country's environmental, social and economic well-being. Until recently, the Canadian forest products industry has been essentially a volume-driven, commodity-based, export-orientated primary producer. In recent years, this industry has faced serious challenges and is shifting toward value-added manufacturing to maximize the value of the forest resource. On the other hand, forest management is intensified to enhance forest productivity and value. To ensure that the forest resource is managed, harvested and utilized to its maximum economic value, it is necessary to develop a series of integrated models to support a value-based and market-driven decision-making strategy instead of a segmented, raw material-driven and volume/yield-based approach. The overall objective of this Strategic Network is to develop a series of new and integrated models to support value-added wood decision-making strategy for Canada's boreal forests. The project includes five themes: 1) Stand and tree growth modelling; 2) Three-dimensional stem quality modelling; 3) Sawmilling products recovery modelling; 4) Value-added wood products recovery modelling; and finally 5) Development of integrated decision-support systems considering the information generated in the four previous themes plus silvicultural, harvesting, manufacturing and marketing costs and end-product value. The development of an integrated wood manufacturing optimization system for principal boreal forest species will allow the industry to optimize the wood products manufacturing processes based on both external stem geometry and internal wood characteristics in order to maximize the value from the individual trees. The integrated models developed] from the project will support value-added silvicultural and harvesting planning to enhance forest stand value. Overall, this Strategic Network will allow the Canadian forest industry to add value along the forest-wood value chain, directly supporting the industry's strategic positioning towards achieving greater value-added wood manufacturing, enhanced forest value and competitiveness within the global market.

"Cardiovascular disease remains the number one killer in developed countries. Acute coronary syndromes and/or sudden cardiac death are both caused by the rupture of a vulnerable coronary atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, stroke appears to be the third cause of death and the leading cause of morbidity. More than 60% of all cerebral infarctions are caused by the rupture of a vulnerable plaque. In this context, we are proposing a French / Canadian pluridisciplinary consortium (MELANII) to develop new ultrasound (US) based imaging tools to assess the mechanical stability of vulnerable coronary and carotid artery walls, respectively. This research is timely since it is now established that mechanical stress affects several cellular processes at the origin of an often fatal thrombotic event, including macrophage migration within the plaque, vessel wall remodelling and modulation of plaque angiogenesis, which are central to the plaque's vulnerability status. Canadian scientists involved in this grant application developed and patented robust elastography approaches (EVE and NIVE) to estimate, with US, deformations within the vascular wall. Concomitantly, French partners designed and patented a complementary imaging modulography tool (iMOD) to go one step further by highlighting the elasticity of all plaque constituents (modulogram). Such a combined expertise in vascular elastography and modulography cannot be found in either France or Canada. The main objectives of this 3-year MELANII France/Canada grant (programme BLANC international) are: 1) to design a novel semi-automatic ""elastography /modulography/morphology"" tool combining the performances of the French's iMOD algorithm

and Canadian's EVE and NIVE methods; 2) to validate this novel tool, a) in vitro on polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA) vascular phantoms, b) in vivo on coronaries and carotids in an atherosclerotic pig model, and finally c) in vivo on coronaries and carotids of patients on statin drug therapy; and 3) to transfer our technology to our commercial partners (ORS in Montreal, Canada and ANSYS in Villeurbanne, France).","G�nie biom�dical","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Biomedical Technologies",1,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Research on the evolution of living and fossil forms has benefited from the linkage between paleontology and evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). Both, neontologists and paleontologists are now viewing adult organism as the result of complex interactions among developmental stability mechanisms and developmental instability. Among the stability processes, phenotypic modularity has been given much attention because of its importance in the evolution of complex anatomical systems. Among the various definitions of modularity, a module could be defined as a network of interacting elements behaving as relatively independent units of development. Highly integrated changes in size and shape during ontogeny have been identified as the result of the action of underlying modular units (e.g., human skull and limbs). Another type of ontogenetic change corresponds to sequences of chondrification (cartilage formation) and ossification (bone formation) that can be described in terms of (1) the time of first appearance of an element, (2) the relative timing within morphological units and (3) the direction of formation among serial elements within morphological units. Direction of ossification has been used to identify phenotypic developmental modules. Only a few modules have been identified in the skeleton of fishes (e.g., the similarity between the dorsal and anal fins). Phenotypic modularity of postcranial elements (vertebral column and fin supports) in living and fossil fishes will be investigated externally (size and shape) and internally (chondrification and ossification sequences) at three levels: (1) integration during ontogeny, (2) integration between ontogeny and environment, and (3) integration between ontogeny and phylogeny. In other words, we will be addressing three fundamental questions about developmental modules: (1) How do they form during the early life stages of a fish?; (2) Are they influenced by environmental factors or stresses?; and (3) Can we track down their evolution? This research program will help to understand developmental mechanisms that have been and are still responsible for the evolution of fishes, the most diversified group of living backboned animals.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Evolution & Ecology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The lithosphere (the rigid outer shell of Earth) of North America developed over the past 4 billion years to generate the collage of geological features that we now see. Determination of present lithospheric structure, and how it formed over geological time, represent basic knowledge about ""inner space"" that is just as important as knowledge of ""outer space"". Such knowledge also has practical applications: regional information useful for diamond, base metal and petroleum companies; and why and how earthquakes occur. The three proposed projects in this application provide some of this knowledge, primarily based on controlled source seismic methods. Project #1 will derive velocity structure, with higher resolution than currently possible, for the uppermost crust through application of a recently developed method, waveform tomography, to first-arriving waves on vibroseis reflection profiles. Results are interpreted in terms of rock types and may be used to improve computer processing of the full dataset. Project #2 seeks to quantitatively characterize features and develop detailed models of lithospheric boundaries, particularly for the base of the crust, the Moho, to better understand the processes involved in lithospheric development and modification. Representative models of the boundaries are generated, some based on physical models and some through statistical analyses of the properties of observed data. Synthetic data equivalent to the observed data are calculated and comparisons are made. LITHOPROBE is Canada's highly acclaimed national Earth science research project [www.lithoprobe.ca], which is concluding after 22 years. Based on results from across Canada, Project #3A will generate a 6000-km-long lithospheric cross-section from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans as well as similar cross-sections for NW and NE Canada. These demonstrate the complexity of the processes involved in the evolution of our country. Project #3B will develop a summary of how Canada became the geological collage that it currently represents. A series of illustrations and accompanying text relating to geological domains and tectonic processes will document Canada's evolution from about 4 billion years ago to the present.","Sciences de la terre","Avancement des connaissances","Solid Earth Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Most chemical reactions are performed in a solvent however, some solvents can cause detrimental effects in the workplace and in the environment at large.  This is primarily due to their volatility, toxicity, and flammability.  Nevertheless, the products created in these solvents are valuable, and include pharmaceuticals and value added materials for electronics applications.  It is important to identify new reaction media for these transformations and many new alternative solvents are available in which to perform the required chemistry.  We plan to investigate the chemistry of basic organometallic materials in non-volatile solvents in a detailed and focused fashion.  These new solvents include ionic and polymeric materials, and we view them as ideal reaction media for working with highly reactive reagents since they are non volatile and fire resistant.  In many cases, especially for polymeric materials such as polyethylene glycols, the solvents are readily biodegradable.   It is anticipated that new chemistry for organometallic reagents will be identified and new environmentally friendlier chemical processes will be developed.

"Now that machines with millions of cores have arrived, we must fundamentally revisit what we mean by scalable systems.  Besides the ability to handle load gracefully, we must consider the increasing expectations and guarantees that now need to be extended to consumers of services across a spectrum of platforms.  Scalable systems must seamlessly grow to incorporate increasing populations of entities embedded in various communication fabrics.  Broadly considered, this concept applies to processors communicating on a bus or across a network, and services communicating through compositions of components.  Ironically however, attempts to add more resources---whether they are physical processing elements or higher-level services---do not always meet with success as they cannot be easily incorporated into existing systems.



We propose to explore means of achieving scalability in this broad context by considering the interaction between key infrastructures often responsible for scaling individual system concerns.  Our goal is to innovate in the area of federated infrastructures that work together according to agreed upon objectives. We plan to consider the interactions that exist between fidelity, virtualization, heterogeneity and concurrency.  By fidelity we mean expectations such as privacy or even quality of service at the user level, virtualization refers to the abstraction of hardware and platforms, heterogeneity considers a wide spectrum of commodity devices, and concurrency reflects the growing state-of-the-art in terms of cores and even clouds of computational elements.  We believe that federation holds promise as no one part of the system alone can resolve the current barriers that prevent systems from scaling.  For example, though virtualization provides a means of coping with heterogeneity, it simultaneously introduces tradeoffs in fidelity, and concurrency.   We propose to explore means of explicitly composing federated infrastructures to reconcile these demands, enabling incorporation of the increasing spectrum of resources and services now available in commodity settings.

"Wireless sensor and actuator networks (SANETs) consist of multiple devices each equipped with a low-power microprocessor, a radio transceiver, and a set of sensors and/or actuators. The actuators are the components of the network that can actively modify the environment - for example, heating elements in a distributed environmental control system. SANETs represent an important extension of sensor networks, as they allow nodes within the network to make autonomous decisions and perform actions (actuation) in response to sensor measurements and shared information. Sensor networks are passive; SANETs actively modify the environment in order to elicit a desired response. The many potential applications include precision farming and localized delivery of medication, but the networks are in the embryonic stage of development.

The overall goal of the research project is the design of a SANET for precision farming. One of the most important tasks of a SANET is the fusion of sensed information to development an understanding of how its environment responds to actuations. The SANET can then generate an actuation strategy, a set of decision rules that determine the actions the network performs when it perceives specific environmental conditions. An example from the agricultural setting is the decision whether to administer herbicide based on recent measurements of temperature and soil salinity.  In conducting this research, we will develop a powerful mathematical framework for addressing the design of actuation strategies in SANETs. We will design robust communication protocols that allow the devices to share their information to enable distributed learning of suitable strategies.

"Transcription factor proteins control gene expression during development in order to introduce pattern into the embryo.  One such patterning process is the formation of the limbs (arms and legs) in the embryo.  We now know that different transcription factors are necessary to develop specific segments of the limbs.  For this reason, birth defects can result when the function of a transcription factor is missing.  Because developmental pattering is similar in all mammals, we use limb development in the mouse as a model.  For example, we have found that the mouse transcription factor Shox2 is necessary to form the proximal segment of the limbs (the humerus in the arms and the femur in the legs).  Shox2 is closely related to the human SHOX protein, which is necessary for normal limb development in humans. 

     SHOX proteins are related to another family of transcription factors called the HOX proteins that are also necessary for the development of specific portions of the limbs.  When we bred mice lacking Shox2 with those lacking specific Hox genes, we found that their progeny had limb defects more severe than expected.  This result suggests that Shox and Hox genes function together to pattern the limbs.  In this proposal we investigate how these genes cooperate during limb development.  

     First we will use genetics to determine the full extent of Shox2 and Hox cooperativity in limb development.  We will also determine which HOX proteins form specific complexes with the SHOX and SHOX2 proteins.  It is these complexes of SHOX and HOX proteins that we predict control the expression of other genes (called target genes) that are necessary for limb development.  Secondly we will analyze the expression of suspected target genes in embryos to determine which genes SHOX2 and HOX proteins regulate.  Lastly we will develop a method to study these proteins in cell culture, which will allow us to understand their function at a more detailed biochemical level.  Together our results will yield important information on how limbs form in humans and all mammals.

"The College and Community Innovation Grant will facilitate capacity building in applied research at Selkirk College especially targeted to support the regional forest sector which is currently experiencing a protracted downturn. The project will focus on development of prototype applications that could allow local small and medium forest enterprises to access, evaluate and analyse data and tools related to potential opportunities in forest carbon markets. The overall project goal is the development and deployment of several potentially transferable and commercializable decision-support tools for forest carbon management (FCM). Although there are some existing decision-support tools designed for FCM, there appears to be considerable need for adapting and customizing them to make them more accessible and useable to regional forest sector SMEs. The outcome will be development of innovative and user-friendly FCM decision-support applications for extension

and transfer to regional forest dependent businesses.



A regional partnership, to be called the Decision Support Collaborative (SDSC), will be established between forest sector stakeholders in the Kootenay Columbia region and Selkirk College---especially the Selkirk Geospatial Research Centre (SGRC) and Regional Innovation Chair (RIC). The SDSC will expand the scope of the existing Kootenay Spatial Data Partnership (KSDP) to include: new small and medium forest companies, community forests representatives, provincial regulatory ministries, the Kootenay Association for Science and Technology (KAST), and representatives from Selkirk College. The purpose of this partnership will be to advise, collaborate with, and guide the project research team in its efforts to build applied research capacity that will assist the regional forest sector adapt, diversify and grow in a changing global environment and economy.","Non disponible","Non disponible","Private Sector Advisory Board",1,"CCIP  ","College and Community Innovation Program","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"The overarching theme of my research program is the linkage between processing and product, with specific emphasis on quality issues in the casting industry. This is an important industry to Canada and, despite being well established, is one facing critical challenges in the years ahead both in terms of increased global competition and reducing energy consumption. There is limited remaining scope for empirical based trial and error design methodologies. Quantitative, mathematically based, tools are needed so that manufacturing aspirations can be matched with design capability.  The ability to virtually design casting processes using computer based mathematical models has the potential to radically transform this industry in the next decade, leading to new and improved products and processes and reduced energy consumption. The project described in this proposal is concerned with understanding hot tearing in aluminum alloys. Losses due to hot-cracking continue to represent a significant economic burden to the casting industry and fusion welding industry in Canada. The goal of the proposed research is to develop novel experimental methodologies for the characterization of damage leading to hot tearing, to understanding the mechanisms at play in the evolution of this damage and to develop a fundamental-based model to describe hot tearing in these alloys that may be used in conjunction with thermal-stress process models.","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","Chem. & Metallurgical Eng.",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"This research concerns the applications of Category Theory to Computer Science and to programming language semantics. It has three main (related) directions:



(1) Abstract Computability:

    Pieter Hofstra and I recently developed an abstract approach to computability using ""Turing categories"".  These allow a unified view of a wide variety of existing computational models, for which, hitherto, there was no common basis.  The development follows earlier work with Steve Lack in which a powerful yet simple algebraic formulation for systems of partial maps was introduced.  The aim is to use these developments to further unify and broaden the applicability of theoretical techniques in this area.



(2) Linear Logic and the Semantics of Concurrency:

    This is a continuation of a research program initiated jointly with Robert Seely, and Rick Blute to explore linear logic and its relation to computation.  Recently Craig Pastro and I used these ideas to show how concurrent programming primitives can be modeled.  This work takes us closer to an objective of this program: the development of formal concurrent languages based on this semantics.



(3) The Semantics of Low Complexity Programs:

    In current work, with Brian Redmond, we are investigating the categorical semantics of low complexity settings using polarized categories and affine linear logic. Already an implementation of a pilot (polynomial time) programming language based on this semantics has been undertaken by Mike Burrell.  The continued theoretical exploration of polynomial time from a categorical perspective is proposed supported by the development of its programming language which makes these ideas more widely accessible.

"Ischemic injury leads to changes in somatosensory perception and enhanced exercise-induced pain. After ischemia-reperfusion injury in the hind paw, rats exhibit lowered paw-withdrawal thresholds to mechanical stimulation, behaviours suggesting that exercise is painful, and they exhibit even lower paw-withdrawal thresholds after exercise. To address the mechanisms underlying these alterations, we will compare the effects of exercise in na�ve rats and rats with a hind paw IR injury on: 1) hind paw muscle thermoregulatory and nutritive blood flow using laser Doppler flowmetry and measures of tissue oxygen partial pressure; 2) hind paw muscle capillary no-reflow and muscle injury using India ink perfusion and a measure of mitochondrial oxidative capacity; 3) hind paw muscle lactate production and tissue acidosis using colorometric assays and assessment of tissue pH; 4) the antinociceptive effects of non-selective and selective ASIC antagonists in rats with ischemia-reperfusion injury.

"    )	The major purpose of the proposed research is to estimate the number of discrete objects rats can retain in their working memory and to determine factors that affect their use of such information while they forage for food. In the basic task, animals are exposed to varying numbers of baited objects in a large foraging area. They must move each object aside from a food well baited with sunflower seeds in a 'study' segment.   Following this 'study' segment of the trial, rats receive a 'test' segment where some of the original 'old' objects are replaced by 'new' baited objects.  The remaining 'old' objects cover empty food wells. The number of 'old' objects rats can remember should determine the number of choices they make to find the new baited objects. An estimate of each rat's  'storage capacity' of old objects in its working memory is determined by comparing its observed distribution of choices for finding the new objects over several trials to the theoretical distributions ranging from that based on chance (no detectable retention) up to that based on 'perfect' retention for all 'old' objects. We are assessing rats' working memory by co-varying the number of objects in the study segment, the number of new baited objects in the test segment, and the duration of the inter-segment (retention) interval in some of our experiments. We also are manipulating other variables known to affect rats' persistence and pattern of foraging within a patch of distributed resources to determine when rats use a memory-directed search instead of other strategies. To accomplish this goal, we are varying the amount of food under new objects compared to that previously found under the old objects, the energy needed to displace objects from food wells by changing the weights of food well covers, and the consistency of the configurations of the new objects.  One of our long-term objectives is to investigate rats' changes in their working memory as they age. Such a preparation could eventually be used to test treatments that could be used for preventing or alleviating age-related declines in cognitive functioning that occur in some humans (e.g., Alzheimer's patients).

"What causes plants to flower? Plant biologists have been trying to answer this question for nearly a century but, until recently, the nature of the signals that cause plants to flower remained a mystery. One important discovery of early research is that flowering signals are produced in the leaves and then transported a long distance to the central shoot of the plant, where the actual flowers are made. My research addresses this question with the modern tools of molecular biology, biochemistry and genomics. The focus of our research is gene from corn (maize) that is critically important for flowering. Maize plants with a normal copy of this gene, called INDETERMINATE1 or ID1, flower at the usual time, whereas mutant maize plants with a defective ID1 gene flower very late and produce flowers with leafy characteristics. We cloned the ID1 gene and characterized it using molecular genetic techniques. The DNA sequence suggests that ID1 acts by making a protein, called a zinc finger, which is a master regulator of other genes. In other words, ID1 causes flowering in corn by turning other genes 'on' or 'off'. This in turn will affect how the plant grows and responds to its environment. There are two main goals of this proposal: 1) to identify genes that are controlled by the ID1 gene, and 2) to identify other proteins that physically interact with the ID1 protein help it carry out its function. Knowing this will give clues about the changes that go on in the plant when flowering is about to occur. Ultimately we would like to identify the biochemical components of these signals, to understand the metabolic changes that affect the flowering process, and to understand how plants interpret environmental signals to flower at the correct time. Discovering how ID1 works will lead to a better understanding of how all plants control their flowering habits. The ability to control when, or if, a plant flowers is of vital importance to agriculture because plants coordinate flowering for optimal seed and fruit production. Determining how plants like maize, and its relatives such as rice, wheat and sugar cane, control flowering will help to improve the productivity of these vital crop plants.

"Over the last few decades, the world has experienced an electro-optical revolution: digital light displays that light up car dashboards, mobile phones and stereo sound systems; fluorescent and phosphorescent screens, for example in portable computers; underwater lighting-equipment and night-working apparatus; optical switches and shock-wave triggers for use within electronic circuitry itself. The optoelectronic and photonics industry was estimated to be worth $236 million on the world market in 2004, and is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2015. Consequently, there is a clear need for major research and development in this area.

    It is generally known that the controlling optical and optoelectronic phenomena are all the result of electronic charge-transfer or ionic displacement within a molecule. It is therefore vital to study the molecular structure of optical and optoelectronic candidate materials, and to establish relationships between the structure and the observed physical properties. Once one has built up sufficient relationships, one can start to 'structurally engineer' materials to tailor them for a specific device application. 

    The structural characterisation tools required for this work are based on X-ray and neutron diffraction, and optical spectroscopy. The three projects described herein are aimed at identifying new materials for: (a) optical data storage; (b) light-emitting diodes (LEDs); and (c) advanced non-linear optical media. The results of the first project could see special holograms replacing the CDs and DVDs in your home, which could hold a staggering Terabyte (1000 Gb) of data in the size of a sugar cube! The second project has strong connections with the Canadian Light Source, a very exciting new venture for Canada. The third project has already reached the demonstration stages of innovation, which is a very encouraging sign for future industrial application.

"Canadians invest tens of millions of dollars annually in geospatial data infrastructure implementation.  In 1999, the Government of Canada alone invested $60 million over 5 years in the GeoConnections initiative for development of the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure.  Another $60 million has since been committed for a second 5-year phase.    In the private sector, the recent proposed sale of Navteq Corporation to Nokia for $8.1 billion indicates the current perception of the value of digital mapping content in financial markets. 

           This research will examine the issues & opportunities and develop prototypes and processes to facilitate timely and reliable updating/upgrading of data held in well-established and ""authoritative"" databases of a geospatial data infrastructure.    It focuses on the increasing convergence of three phenomena: (1) the widespread use of mapping technologies by professionals and expert amateurs;  (2) the emerging role of Web 2.0,  ""wiki"" software and standards based authentication processes that allow users to easily contribute, edit and link information on Web pages; and (3) the growth of social networking tools, practices and culture.   From this base, the research will investigate how contributions from both individual citizens and professional mapping projects may most reliably be authenticated, processed and employed to populate new open-source and commercial databases.   

          Standards-based prototypes of system and workflow components will be developed, trialed and assessed in cooperation with government mapping organizations.   If successful, the components and workflows developed will help reduce costs and turnaround times for shared feature updating of geospatial databases.  In the longer term, concepts and developments here may potentially set the stage for future mapping practices and help define a new paradigm for shared, user-driven geospatial database production, management and dissemination.  This will benefit users in government mapping organizations, private companies, and community groups.

"Computationally challenging optimization problems are increasingly arising in the area of finance applications. I propose to work on two important examples.



Firstly, in the insurance industry, risk management strategies under stochastic scenarios is an area of growing importance. The challenge here is twofold: how to properly formulate the problems in the language of optimization, and how to solve the resulting problems with an eye toward efficiency (computationally feasible!) and robustness. I will develop and investigate new (optimal) dynamic hedging strategies accounting for major complex risks including basis risk and surrender risk of segregated (variable annuity) insurance contracts.



Secondly, I will examine the area of computing optimal investment strategies for portfolios involving hedge funds. This is a very challenging problem  for several reasons including scarcity of data and non-normality of the hedge fund return distributions. Traditional (equity-based) portfolio strategies are inappropriate. However, progress on this problem is urgently needed given the increased interest by both institutional and individual investors in diversifying their portfolios by investing in hedge funds. We will investigate robust, but computationally feasible, optimization approaches for this problem.

"An explosion of insight into basic nonlinear Hamiltonian partial differential equations (PDE) occurred in the last fifteen years through a systematic application of multilinear harmonic analysis and other tools. A robust local-in-time theory for initial value problems with rough initial data is now in place. This research proposal is designed to advance the recent progress towards a maximal-in-time theory for nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE under optimal regularity properties. In particular, the proposed research contributes along three lines: 1. Clarify optimal regularity for local-in-time well-posedness. 2. Establish global-in-time well-posedness and long time behavior at low regularity. 3. Describe finite time blowup behavior at low regularity. These lines of investigation addresses mathematically common features of physical evolution equations in plasma physics, optics, fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, etc., with engineering applications in semiconductors, telecommunications, aerospace, and beyond. No specific scientific or engineering application motivates the proposed studies rather the aim is to contribute toward a general rigorous theory of nonlinear phenomena including turbulence, singularity formation, scattering and recurrence. The widespread applicability of Hamiltonian PDE, across diverse fields of current scientific and technological significance,  demonstrates the central prominence of the proposed research to our science and engineering infrastructure.

"    )	Although seeing is something most of us do every day without obvious effort, it is in fact an incredibly complex task. This research is an attempt to figure out how the human visual system (the eyes and brain) accomplishes this task. In particular, it focuses on an interesting ""divide and conquer"" strategy that the brain uses, called Spatial Frequency (SF) analysis. We have known for some time now that the brain divides information from the retinas according to its SF spectum.  SF can be thought of as a way of quantifying levels of visual detail, where low SFs correspond to general shapes of objects and high SFs correspond to smaller details. The question this research addresses is this: Why does the brain divide things up this way?

    )	One hypothesis is that different levels of visual detail are most useful for different visual perception tasks. It has been found, for instance, that a certain range of middle SFs is most useful for face recognition. Our research looks at which ranges of SFs are most useful for a range of everyday tasks, such as recognizing faces or common objects, and navigating through unfamiliar environments.

    )	The way we do this is in principle quite simple: We first limit the range of SFs in an image, so that it looks blurry or sketch-like, and then see how this affects face recognition performance. At the same time, we measure brain function using the ERP technique.  This allows us to map out how information is passed from one brain area to another.  Ultimately, our goal is to map out the series of steps the brain undertakes in doing various visual tasks and thereby create a predictive model of how it does them.

    Along with its scientific discoveries, this research program will provide important training to students in higher education. Each year, from 3-5 graduate students and numerous undergraduates working on the program will gain important research skills, preparing them for their own scientific careers.

"Mathematical knots, visualised as a simple but knotted closed rope, have been studied by scientists since the end of the XIXth century. One of the early motivations was to use these objects as a way to understand properties of atoms and matter. The ties to natural sciences have grown over the years and nowadays, for example, the study of DNA topology is an active, interdisciplinary area of research.

From early days of Knot theory, the classification problem for knots has played a central and motivating role. The basic problem seems quite simple: can one tell if two given knots are topologically equivalent or not. Approaches to this problem have led topologists to study various classes of knots and to try to characterize their numerous invariants. Moreover, generations of mathematicians have constructed increasingly complex knot invariants which aim to capture essential properties of knots such as genus, slice genus, unknotting number and so on.



One of the many uses of knots, from a mathematical perspective, is that they are intimately related to objects called 3-manifolds, whose classification has been a central problem in Mathematics for more than 60 years. Indeed examples of the relationship between the two (nonts and 3-manifolds) are provided by constructions like Dehn surgery and cyclic branched covers along knots.  Our research is concerned with invariants of knots and such 3-manifolds, the invariants we are interested in being obtained from elliptic partial differential equations on manifolds. In particular, the study of Floer homology theory in its various flavours has helped to prove various conjectures in the area of low-dimensional topology and the applicant's research proposal outlines various problems which may be approached with these powerful invariants.

"Operator Algebra Theory is the mathematical framework for the study of quantum mechanics.

It has many applications to various parts of mathematics and renewed interaction with other scientific areas (physics, quantum information...). The question of studying the structure of operator algebras has been the object of tremendous research and progresses during the last decades. The object of my research is to focus on 'asymptotic probabilistic' aspects of these algebras. Very important questions have been left open for many years in Operator Algebra Theory, such as Connes' embedding problem. One of my leitmotiv would be to try to figure out which operator algebras can be approximated by matrices in the sense of moments, and how good can these approximations be. In the same vein, I plan to investigate which non-commutative random variables can be approximated by random matrices, and how this extends at the level of continuous time processes. The method proposed relies mainly on probabilistic techniques inspired from Random Matrix Theory and on representation theoretic methods. In particular, Matrix Integral theory is a tool I intend to make a fundamental use of. Also, I plan to make use of diagrammatic expansion (Feynman diagrams) of relevant matrix integrals. An other method of potential crucial use is asymptotic combinatorics following methods of Biane and Speicher, and recent breakthroughs in the Horn problem. I expect that the operator algebraic motivations of this proposal will provide new applications and tools to random matrix theory. I also believe that interdisciplinary collaborations with physicists could arise from my research program, as it has already arosen in the past (with theoretical physicists and astronomers).

"A motor unit is composed of a motor neuron in the spinal cord, it's axon that travels out to the muscle, and all the muscle fibres it innervates. Motor units provide the only output from the central nervous system to skeletal muscle and thus play a key role in the neural control of movement. Motor units are controlled by descending voluntary commands from the brain and feedback from sensory receptors. Impulses from sensory receptors activate motor units via reflex pathways through the spinal cord. A common way to study the reflex control of motor units is to deliver one or two pulses of electrical stimulation to a peripheral nerve and record the reflex response (H-reflex), mediated through the spinal cord, that returns to the muscle. This technique has provided a wealth of information about human reflexes. During human movement, however, motor units do not receive only one or two impulses along reflex pathways but rather they receive multiple impulses over several seconds. How motor units respond to such repetitive inputs has gone largely unexplored. In addition, motor units often remain active even when the stimulation is turned off, but the mechanisms that underlie these involuntary contractions remains controversial. The short term goals for the experiments described in this proposal are to characterize how motor units respond when they receive physiologically relevant trains of impulses along reflex pathways at different frequencies, intensities and at different levels of voluntary contraction. The long term goals are to identify the mechanisms responsible for: 1) the changes in reflex amplitude that occur during repetitive stimulation and 2) the involuntary muscle contractions that persist after the stimulation has been turned off. The results will identify how motor units respond when they receive inputs along reflex pathways that are more physiologically relevant than have been studied previously (i.e. trains of impulses rather than just one or two impulses). The findings may lead to new way of thinking about the neural control of human motor units.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Integrative Animal Biology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta

"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disease of young adults, affecting approximately 50,000 people in Canada. The disease is characterized by transient attacks on the central nervous system and results in numbness or weakness of a limb, in coordination, vertigo or visual dysfunction. At present there is no cure. Over the last decade, a number of new therapies have been approved for clinical use based primarily on demonstration of their ability to reduce the number of new lesions. These drugs reduce the number of attacks by 30-50%. Evaluation of newer, more efficient treatments requires clinical trails where the ""burden of disease"" is measured by identification of new lesions seen in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The state of the art for lesion identification in the pharmaceutical industry consists of subjective manual or semi-manual procedures. This process is subject to inter- and intra-observer variability that diminishes the statistical power to detect a drug effect. To address this problem, one must increase the number of subjects in the study a very expensive option.

The goal of this project is to develop a robust, accurate and fully automatic tissue classification technique that can identify healthy and diseased tissues when applied to real clinical MRI data. Efficient successful drug development would benefit from such a technique because the improved statistical power to detect change can be used to diminish the number of subjects required or reduce the amount of time required to detect a treatment effect in a clinical trials (or both). In either case, trial costs are reduced, thus enabling the evaluation more candidate treatments. This procedure would also benefit academic research laboratories for the analysis of MRI data to further understand the disease process in MS in order to find finding better, more efficient treatments.

"Canada's forest industry is a vital component of her economy.  In the face of intense global competitiveness forestry companies need systems to help them manage the forest resources under their control. Provincial governments require forestry companies to monitor the characteristics of the canopy trees, e.g. species composition, age, height etc, on the forested lands under their licences.  In addition they require companies to maintain natural mixtures of canopy tree species rather than turning the landscape into plantations.  This practice is often termed ""sustainable forestry"".  



Most current monitoring methods rely on manual interpretation of aerial photographs, an expensive practice that has been in place for more than thirty years.  Automated systems based on remotely sensed imagery, digital terrain models, environmental models and some field observations are capable of producing maps of forest characteristics in a cost effective way.  



This research will develop a sophisticated Forest Information system that will aid forest resource managers in making decisions.  The system integrates advanced remote sensing imagery such as high resolution radar imagery with more familar optical imagery and produces maps that reflect the natural spatial pattern in the landscape.  It employs a simple yet powerful system called a Bayesian network to convert data into information that is accessible to decision makers.",Environnement,Environnement,"Civil Engineering - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Alberta,Alberta
"Combined Solar Electric and Solar Thermal Systems (called PV/Thermal Systems) join solar electric (PV) and solar thermal technologies into one solar panel with both electrical and thermal energy output. 



PV/Thermal panels have advantages over stand alone single-purpose panels.

- The PV operates at lower than normal temperatures because heat is removed by the thermal collector, leading to higher electrical, and overall solar, conversion efficiencies. 

- The dual nature of the PV/Thermal panels makes them ideal when installation space is limited. 

- Joining the long payback of PV systems with the relatively short payback of solar thermal systems, results in a payback that is more palatable to a building owner than a PV-only installation. 



Of the few commercially available PV/Thermal manufacturers, most produce products that are modified solar-thermal collectors. This research will focus on the development of new PV/Thermal designs based on an air heating platform. In difference to existing products, however, the new designs have been conceived with total integration of the electrical and thermal systems, and with consideration given to issues that hinder wide scale consumer acceptance of existing PV/Thermal panels such as reliability, aesthetics, and ease of installation.



PV/Thermal air-heating systems have great potential to offset both electrical loads and heating demand in the Canadian environment, and could become a great asset in achieving a distributed energy system. This research will introduce new products to the market, develop products in conjunction with Canadian companies, and train personnel in aspects of solar design.

"The objectives of this long term research program are to understand how cracked reinforced concrete transmits shear and torsional loading and to use this understanding to develop simple, general, rational and accurate procedures for the shear design of new reinforced concrete structures and for the evaluation of existing structures.  Shear failures can cause concrete structures to collapse without warning and hence, are of critical concern for public safety.In the last five years, major progress has been made in improving the quality of shear design provisions which will greatly reduce the chance of catastrophic shear failures for new concrete structures.  However, we also now know that many existing concrete structures do not have an appropriate margin of safety against shear failure.  The major objective of the next five years is to develop the tools to decide which structures must be repaired and to provide practical procedures to do so.This will be done by conducting experiments on intensively instrumented elements of reinforced concrete subjected to loadings which simulate the actual conditions encountered in practice. Recently developed techniques will be improved to enable the formation,opening, propogation and sliding of critical cracks to be recorded so that the characteristic crack patterns of impending shear collapse can be accurately defined.The influence of cycles of load on crack propogation and bond deterioration for members containing reinforcement details representative of those in existing structures will be studied and the effects of restraint of shrinkage and thermal movements, which occur in actual structures, will be simulated. The experimental studies will be supplemented with extensive non-linear 3D finite element analyses. Finally simple analytical models suitable for use by practicing engineers to evaluate existing structures for shear safety will be developed.The research will be conducted by graduate students who will develop a deep understanding of the shear behaviour of reinforced concrete structures under extreme loadings. After such research they will be equiped to contribute to the safety assessment of Canada's critical infrastructure.

"During the last few decades the science of asymmetric catalysis has experienced significant advances.  However, as Nature continues to supply organic chemists with new and fascinating chemical structures, it also presents us with new challenges.  These new challenges demand technologies that are ever more general, practical, environmentally friendly and powerful.  Consequently, asymmetric synthesis continues to evolve and existing synthetic methods are often replaced as more effective methods are developed.  The specific goal of the research program is to develop new methods for the stereoselective synthesis of molecules possessing helical and planar chirality.  The molecules that possess this unique chemical property are of considerable importance.  These molecules are found across many scientific disciplines and in many industrial applications (pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, biology, biochemistry, food sciences, etc.).  Considering today's demand for enantiomerically pure compounds, our proposed research focuses on developing new catalytic strategies to construct these molecules.

"The western boreal mixedwood forest region is a 48 million hectare band of mixed deciduous-coniferous forest extending from the northern Rocky mountains to southwestern Manitoba, covering an area about 75% the size of Alberta. Widespread industrial forest management of this region is relatively recent. As a result, the monitoring programs which support sustainable management have so far followed the stands of most interest; the young stands which were planted since active reforestation efforts began 25 years ago, and the 70-year and older natural-origin stands which will soon be harvested. A lack of data for mid-aged (25-70 year old) mixed-species stands and younger white spruce dominated (<70 year old) stands is hindering our ability to accurately predict forest development following harvesting or natural disturbance. Rates of growth and mortality of the major species, aspen and white spruce, and their effects on each other during these middle years of stand development are poorly quantified. The studies included in this proposal will investigate these species interactions. Tree-ring measurements, a historical white spruce release trial, and our own targeted monitor plots will be utilized. Results will be integrated into a computer simulation model of forest-growth which evaluates the relative importance of these factors, provides a tool for forest planning, and supports intervention decisions (nursery stock selection, planting, tending, and thinning) for effective management of the western boreal forest.  

One of the challenges of sustainable forest management is to choose interventions and set regeneration targets that will maintain the natural variation in stand and landscape structures over the long term, thereby maintaining ecosystem integrity and function. Due to the complexity of multiple species interactions, mixedwoods have been a difficult forest type to manage. By more accurately modeling mixed-species interactions, this work will improve Canadian foresters' ability to maintain a more natural mosaic of stand and landscape composition in this and similar mixed forest regions.","Foresterie (sylviculture, am�nagement forestier)","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Alberta,Alberta

"The purpose of this research is to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which the gut resident microbiota regulates the postnatal establishment of the intestinal mucus layer. The mucus layer plays a critical role in the intestinal barrier function since it protects the epithelium from luminal pathogens and toxins.  The mucus layer is located between the mucosa and the microbiota, a complex community of trillions of microorganisms. The gut microbiota is acquired after birth through a gradual diversification process ending after weaning, when an adult-type composition is achieved. This process parallels the establishment of the gut barrier and in particular of the mucus layer. While in the adult the composition of the microbiota regulates the expression of epithelial barrier-related genes, it is not known if it does so in early life. We will perform a global gene expression analysis in epithelial cells isolated from the intestine of conventional (with a ""normal"" microbiota) and germ-free (without any bacteria) mice at different times after birth in order to assess the impact of the evolving gut microbial community on the timely appropriate expression of genes regulating the establishment of the mucus layer. Given that alteration of mucus layer composition characterizes several gastro-intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and mucositis, understanding the molecular mechanisms of its establishment has implications for the understanding of these pathologies as well as for the design of new therapies and treatments. Furthermore, this research has implications for the development of dietary guidelines to improve human health through nutritional approaches targeting the maintenance of a healthy gut microbial community in the intestine.

"The heart is composed of electrically active cells. The cell is mechanically coupled by an elastic matrix. There is a functional link between mechanical and electrical actions. This link can change under pathological conditions when the tissue is stretched. The dispersion of stretch throughout the tissue can differ. Electrical properties can change with stretch through activation of special electrical channels. High level of stretch even induces cell death and fibrosis. Increasing fibrosis results in the formation of obstacles to electrical propagation. The changes in electrical properties and the formation of obstacles can both play an important role in cardiac arrhythmias. New tools to understand the effects of tissue stretch on arrhythmias are needed. The main objective of this project is to build a realistic model of the effects of stretch and fibrosis on electrical activity of cardiac tissue. However, there is limited data and tools to detail these effects. 

A new imaging method to study the dispersion of stretch will be developed. A special tool is also developed to detail the effects of stretch on cardiac cells. The changes that occur over time will be studied with this tool. All the new effects documented with these tools will be implemented in the mathematical model. Simulations of the model will help understand how the stretch and fibrosis are important in cardiac arrhythmias.

"In this research, we will be mainly interested in investigating MIMO based wireless communication systems as well as using the MIMO concept in developing new techniques for the localisation of mobile units using DSP based data procesing algorithms. The benefit expected from this research is two fold.



1) Provide practical channel modeling based on actual propagation conditions in the presence of transmitting and receiving arrays. This is oarticularly critical in the case of MIMO if it is desired to properly assess algorithms performance which is highly sensitive to correlation and rank properties of the link matrix associated with the channel.



2) Because of multipath propagation, the signal received at the base consists of a sum of scattered signals, included discrete components with individual angles of arrival (AOA), angles of departure (AOD) as well as times of arrival (TOA). Consequently, using simple geometric arguments a MIMO system can provide information on the mutual positioning between the base and the mobile in a number of ways.","Syst�mes et services de communications (planification, organisation et services)","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","Commun.,Computers & Components",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"In recent years, visualization has been gaining importance as a means of managing the often overwhelming amount of digital information available to users. However, despite the many attempts to identify mappings between user needs and effective visualizations, results are still inconclusive and often conflicting.

We argue that a reason for these results is that most of these attempts relied on the assumption that optimal visualizations can be defined based solely on the target data/user task, while we believe that individual user differences also play a role. Given a task, different visualizations may work best for different users, depending

on user traits such as cognitive skills, knowledge and preferences. In addition, a user's visualization needs may change dynamically as they learn to use a visualization tool or as they experience different mental or affective states.

The goal of the proposed research is two-fold. First, we want to develop new principles to define the role of individual differences in different data visualization tasks and lay the foundations for subsequent tool development. Next, we will use these principles to develop adaptive visualizations, i.e. advanced visualization tools that can model and adapt in real time to those user's traits that impact visualization effectiveness.

Although the benefits of user-adaptive interaction have been shown in relation to interaction tasks such as operation of menu-based interfaces, web browsing, and information retrieval, these ideas have rarely been applied to data visualization, mostly because there is limited understanding on which user features the visualization should adapt to and how. After we gain this understanding in the initial phases of our project, we plan to demonstrate the benefits of the resulting tools by implementing and evaluating a capstone system for an application domain of interest to one of our industrial partners.

"Exposure of living organisms to environmental agents, like: the ultraviolet component of sunlight, ionizing radiation and numerous genotoxic chemicals, cause DNA damage. If not repaired, damaged DNA promotes the formation of mutations and genome instability. Therefore, studies on the mechanisms by which damaged DNA is repaired are of primary importance for the evolution of species.



Since in the cells DNA is packed into a structure called chromatin, there is the need to understand how DNA repair occurs in chromatin. In the proposed research, yeast will be used as model organism to study DNA repair because DNA repair in yeast present most of the hallmarks of DNA repair in a vast range of organisms, including humans.



Clearly, increasing our understanding on the DNA repair mechanisms involved in maintaining stability of the genome will help to define the role of DNA protection systems in hereditary.

"Gyrodactylosis is a skin and gill disease of fish caused by small-bodied ectoparasitic worms. Preliminary

research by the applicants indicates there is a rich, but poorly understood, species pool of these parasites on

wild gadoid fishes (cod, haddock, pollock, and hake) in the North Atlantic. Outbreaks of gyrodactylosis have

occurred in cage operations growing cod in Norwegian waters, with methods to treat stocks held in sea cages

being developed. It is totally predictable, that the emergence of gyrodactylosis of cod in the North Atlantic

Ocean will follow a similar pattern to that of sea lice, a serious problem wherever Atlantic salmon are being

grown under aquaculture conditions. The sea lice problem first became established in Norway and, as Atlantic

salmon aquaculture developed elsewhere, the same problem appeared in Scotland, Ireland, eastern Canada, and

most recently in western Canada. The present research proposal will provide information about the genetic

variation of the parasites on cod stocks and the susceptibility of families of cod developed by the cod genome

project. In addition, we will assess experimentally the effect of infection on growth and survival of captive

young cod, the nature of their innate resistance, as well as the assessment of environmentally friendly bath

treatments for the disease.",Aquiculture,"Agriculture et produits alimentaires primaires","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Fishery Industry","2 & 3","STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","Nova Scotia","Nouvelle-�cosse"

"The cell consists of many different compartments, each carrying out a distinct function. For example, the ""lysosome"" can be thought of as the cell's recycling centre, since it contains enzymes that break down unwanted proteins so their components can be re-used to make new proteins. In addition to getting rid of unwanted molecules, special types of lysosomes serve as storage compartments for proteins needed for immunity, blood clotting, and brain function. 

      The enzymes that recycle proteins inside lysosomes are first manufactured in a different compartment called the ""Golgi"". These enzymes are then moved from the Golgi to the lysosome in small containers called ""vesicles"".  It is very important that the correct protein is sorted into the right vesicle so it can be delivered to the right place. This task is generally fulfilled by a group of proteins, called Adaptor Protein complexes, which recognize cargo molecules for transport and initiate the process that will take them to their final destination. 

      A specific type of Adaptor Protein complex, AP-3, is required for the formation and function of lysosomes. However, Adaptor Proteins cannot work by themselves. Other types of Adaptors have regulators that guide them to the correct location and activate them for cargo binding, but so far no regulators for AP-3 have been found. We use yeast as a model system to identify these regulators and understand how they work. Although yeast is a simple organism, the yeast AP-3 regulates a strikingly similar pathway to the vacuole, the yeast version of the human lysosome. As a result, yeast is an excellent resource for identifying the genes involved in the complex transport pathways that operate in humans. The simple nature of the yeast genome also allows us to obtain a 'snapshot' view of all the genes that are cooperating to regulate a cellular pathway. This will tell us which genes in humans might also work with AP-3, and how the pathway they regulate might lead to the formation of lysosomes.

"The proposed study is to investigate the origin of metals in hydrothermal deposits.  Knowing where metals in these types of deposit orginate from impacts both our scientific understanding of ore formation processes and the discovery of innovative methods for the identification and evaluation of new exploration targets.  The source of metals for these deposits is a matter of great debate, with two prevailing theories: 1) hydrothermal sources, where metals originate from the passage of hot waters (up to 350 degC) through cracks and pores within the rocks beneath Earth's surface, with interaction between the hot water and the rock resulting in the transfer of metals to the fluid; or, 2) magmatic sources, where metals are sequestered by gases and fluids trapped within the molten magma.  This study will determine the extent to which metals are removed from the magma and transferred to the gas-water component at great depths beneath the Earth's surface.  The fundamental information to be obtained in the study is the chemical compositions of melt inclusions, small remnants of volcanic glass, gas and water trapped in minerals that formed in the magma prior to eruption.  Melt inclusion analyses will be complemented by investigating the chemical nature of metals in magmas and hydrothermal fluids through several experimental studies, where the high-temperature and pressure conditions that characterize the deeper levels of the Earth's crust will be simulated in the laboratory.  Several analytical techniques using state-of-the-art, high precision geochemical instrumentation will be required to obtain accurate compositions of natural melt inclusions and experimental products.  This study will form the basis of several undergraduate and graduate research projects at Lakehead University, which will benefit Canada by training highly qualified geoscientists.  The applied nature of the research will benefit the mining and exploration sector by improving our understanding of processes involved in the formation of metallic mineral deposits, which can be used to develop new strategies for their discovery and sustainable development.

"The northern lights blazing in a Canadian night sky signal that activity is taking place in the region of space near the Earth. Yet many details of this activity remain unknown. The ""geomagnetic substorm"" is still a mystery of geophysics despite many years of study. By looking at parts of it and what is happening globally when it explodes into being, we will gain vital clues. The flow of plasma around the Earth is a part of the

substorm that can be studied from the ground. We measure tiny changes in the Earth's magnetic field due to electrical currents that thread the aurora. Along with measurements from research satellites, if the timing is right, these can tell is what conditions are like near or inside the auroral disturbances. Due to the difficulty in obtaining and interpreting data, the aurora has been mysterious. We will characterize its behaviour as an important part of coming to understand it and the nearby region of space known as the magnetosphere. Modern technologies in instrumentation and communications, some developed at Athabasca University, allow us to make great strides in obtaining the information we need. Further, we now have techniques to better organize and understand the data. The project focusses on auroral forms, and their magnetic signatures. These forms seem to be stirred up like waves on a water surface, telling us about stormy conditions in space. Alberta has great advantages in being a good place to see the aurora, along with good communications facilities. Our instruments are coupled to many in Canada, including new ones in Quebec. Our instrumentation will be installed to operate at the same time as the Canadian ePOP-CASSIOPE and the American THEMIS satellites, to maximize what we can learn by studying the aurora from the ground. We expect to fully understand certain auroras under study, making an important contribution to solving the auroral substorm problem.

"XML is the dominant format for web data, and is particularly suitable to represent the many forms of semi-structured data present in web pages, blogs, wikis, RSS feeds, etc.



XML is also the wire format for data exchanged via web services, and as such is at the foundation of modern Business Process Management approaches that are built on top of service-oriented architectures. 



The objectives of our research are to develop an array of novel techniques for XML data management that can significantly contribute to the retrieval and management of both semi-structured and business process data.



We propose to start by addressing the problem of describing and visualizing the structure of large collections of XML documents using summaries.



We are also interested in techniques for processing retrieval queries that combine structural constraints with keyword search. Supporting these queries in a way that can be answered as efficiently and effectively as in traditional keyword searching is an ambitious goal for XML data management systems. To begin, we will address the challenge of how to measure the effectiveness of retrieval results obtained from XML collections.



We intend to apply the preceding techniques to facilitate the retrieval and the description of data exchanged among business processes.

"Flavonoids are widespread secondary plant metabolites important to human health as dietary anti-oxidants and

functional foods. In epidemiological studies, the class of polymeric flavonoids known as proanthocyanidins is

particularly strongly linked to a reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease and some cancers.

Proanthocyanidins are found in tea, cocoa, and fruit and berry crops. The research outlined in this proposal will

identify and test key regulatory genes for proanthocyanidin synthesis in apple and blueberry, and to enhance

proanthocyanidin levels in apple trees and fruit using metabolic engineering. We have recently identified

potent proanthocyanidin regulatory genes in poplar, which provide the starting point for this work. Blueberry

and apple produce some proanthocyanidins together with a variety of other flavonoids; we will therefore

identify the corresponding blueberry and apple regulatory genes, as well as genes encoding biosynthetic

enzymes, in order to study their function in these functional food crops. Our proanthocyanidin regulators will

also be overexpressed in transgenic apple trees by our partner organization Okanagan Biotechnology Inc,

leaders in the field of apple transformation, in order create high proanthocyanidin apples and to demonstrate

their efficacy in apple. Ultimately, we intend to assemble a tool box for precise metabolic engineering of

functional food genes, which will permit precise manipulation of health-promoting chemicals. The presence of

health-promoting proanthocyanidins in higher levels and in a greater variety of food plants will lead to reduced

cardiovascular disease and increased health for Canadians.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Food and Bioproducts",3,"STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Understanding the variation in the composition of seawater over geological time is central to understanding the long-term evolution of the Earth system and the processes that control long-term climate change. The principal emphasis of the scientific community is currently focused on understanding sub-aerial chemical weathering and river chemistry to understand the inputs into the ocean from the continents and their impact on ocean chemistry - this is undoubtedly important to do. However, there is currently far more uncertainty in the chemical exchange between the oceanic lithosphere and oceans than there is in the modern riverine chemical fluxes. This is largely due to two factors, the inaccessibility of the ocean crust and the heterogeneity of chemical exchange between seawater and the oceanic crust. The research program I propose here will start to address this in a fully quantitative manner through building a model of the processes that operate in oceanic hydrothermal systems and 'calibrating' it against the diverse, but sparse, observations that help to constrain these processes. These observations include: (i) the composition of rocks recovered from the seafloor; (ii) the compositions of fluids venting from the seafloor; (iii) the physical properties of the upper oceanic crust determined remotely, for example by seismic experiments; and (iv) the amount of heat that is being lost through the ocean floor. The results of this work will provide the foundation for understanding the origin of past changes in ocean chemistry. In combination with independent estimates of the composition of seawater in the past these models will allow us to determine the composition of the ancient river input into the ocean. Only through better quantifying these processes can the long-term controls on climate be fully understood.","Sciences de la terre","Avancement des connaissances","Solid Earth Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Performance measurement and benchmarking are important underpinnings of our economic system, particularly the large Canadian service sector. Banks, hospitals, schools, and fast food restaurants are but a few examples of organizations that can benefit from benchmarking and efficiency evaluation. By having effective tools for measuring the performance of any organization relative to its peers or competitors, that organization can have a better understanding of any gaps that may exist between where it currently stands and where its potential lies. 



The proposed research is aimed at developing decision support tools for modeling performance and identifying best practice in organizations. The model structure to be used is data envelopment analysis (DEA), which falls within the broader set of multiple criteria decision-making methodologies. DEA research has spanned three decades; the proposed research program examines some of the major issues that have arisen in the process of applying DEA to real world problems.



An important area of current research is supply chain management. Having the means for analyzing supply chains and making performance comparisons between vendors and their associated supply chains, is now becoming a must in both 'for profit' and 'not for profit' settings.

"Nuclear power is an attractive energy source in today's society where concern for control of environmental emissions and greenhouse gases is increasing and the expected taxes to be levied on carbon emissions are becoming a reality.  The possibility of making our nuclear power plants more efficient and multipurpose to help alleviate these environmental concerns has been gaining much attention and is the focus of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF), an international treaty signed by 13 countries, including Canada, to investigate future nuclear reactor designs.  One of the reactor technologies of interest to the GIF is the supercritical water reactor (SCWR).  This reactor would use supercritical water (water whose temperature and pressure are above its critical point, 371 degC and 22.1 MPa respectively) to remove the heat from the reactor core and is a logical evolution of current reactor designs.  Canada is particularly interested in this design since the pressure-tube configuration of the CANDU reactor is well suited for operation in supercritical conditions.  The use of supercritical water to cool the reactor has many benefits including no phase separation (boiling will not occur above the critical point) and higher thermodynamic efficiency of the power cycle due to the much higher temperatures employed (up to 625 degC).   For the same net power output as current reactors, the higher efficiencies in a SCWR would result in a smaller reactor that is less costly to build and consumes less fuel thereby reducing used fuel production.  

The selection of materials that can be used to construct a SCWR is one of the key research areas required before a design can be implemented.  This research program will investigate the corrosion and stress-corrosion cracking of alloys that may be considered for use in a SCWR and the subsequent transport and deposition of their corrosion products.  A test loop has been built at UNB to simulate the expected operating conditions in a SCWR and will be used to expose candidate materials, coatings or new alloys to a supercritical water environment and evaluate their suitability for use in a SCWR.

"To effectively mount an interdisciplinary field- and laboratory-based research programme at the interface of animal behaviour, physiology, and ecology, it is essential to have a suite of tools that enable the remote study of animals.  To support and expand our research programmes, we are requesting a Remote Animal Activity Monitoring System for use on fish and aquatic herpetefauna.  The system will use passive integrated transponder technology.  A passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag consists of an integrated circuit chip and coil antenna which, when energized by a low-radio frequency reader coil, transmits a unique identity code. Having no battery, the tags are small, inexpensive, and do not have battery life limitations.  Consequently, PIT tagging offers opportunities for identifying individuals at a scale approaching that of the population, something that is rarely achievable for other telemetry methods, for economic reasons.  PIT technology has become an important tool for studying animal movement using PIT arrays in the field in systems as diverse as streams, experimental ponds and mesocosms, all systems frequently used by the research team.  Several of the co-applicants also conduct applied conservation research on topics such as by-catch reduction of fish and turtles and fish passage evaluation at barriers, all of which will benefit from this technology.  Also relevant for the application is the fact that the activity monitoring system is modular so that it can also be used in the wetlabs at both Carleton and uOttawa.  In the laboratory the PIT technology would provide an additional dimension to comparative physiology studies by enabling the quantification of fish activity and behaviour, something that has been difficult to achieve to date.   The seven co-applicants (from the Ottawa-Carleton Institute of Biology) involved in this RTI application have varied and overlapping interests in the fields of ecology, behaviour, and physiology with a focus on aquatic animals.  The co-applicants currently collaborate on a number of projects, but the proposed research tools will increase our capacity for collaborative interdisciplinary research and the training of the next generation of integrative biologists.

"In the last three yrs, our lab has made significant progress in understanding the physiology of parental care in fish through research supported by the NSERC Discovery Grant (DG) program. In doing so, three Ph.D., one M.Sc., and eight undergraduate students have been supported and trained by my DG program. It is clear from all of our studies that parental care is an inherently stressful period, yet when faced with additional stressors, there appear to be compensatory mechanisms that reduce the immediate negative consequences of stress. We have also developed and validated a number of new techniques for conducting physiological research on fish in the wild which provides the toolbox necessary to advance my research program. My first three yrs of research elucidated a number of additional questions with respect to stress in fish. These questions are the focus of the next five years of DG research. Specifically, my goal is to study the ecology of stress in wild fish, attempting to understand why not all individuals appear to respond in the same manner (i.e., mediators of stress responsiveness), and to understand the consequences of stress on organismal condition, behaviour, and fitness. This work is consistent with my long-term goal to establish a clear understanding of the inter-relationships between physiology, behaviour and reproductive success in fishes and their role in shaping fish populations. The proposed research will provide the data needed to parameterize such a model for vertebrates in a future DG application to fully understand the population-level consequences of stress on animal distribution and abundance. Using a combination of centrarchids and salmonids our team will conduct integrated laboratory and field experiments that use techniques such as exogenous implantation of cortisol, physiological/endocrine assays, respirometry, proximate body composition analyses, and long-term monitoring of individual fitness. Collectively, this work will represent the first studies on ecological factors and trade-offs influencing stress responsiveness in wild fish, providing ample opportunity to contrast findings with other taxa (i.e., birds) for which there is more data.

"Abundant Pacific salmon stocks are important economically, ecologically, culturally and politically to Canada.

New federal fisheries policy and management strategies have shifted large amounts of salmon harvesting from

marine to coastal river locations where First Nations, recreational, and commercial fisheries all occur. Despite

the use of different gear (e.g. gillnets, beach seines, angling), all sectors involved in freshwater Pacific salmon

fisheries will capture non-targeted or non-desirable fish. Being able to release these fish and ensure their

survivability is paramount to achieve harvest allocations, stock conservation, and the sustainability of these

fisheries. Using lower Fraser River fisheries as the model, we propose studies to quantify sub-lethal

disturbances and mortality rates of different species relative to gear type and to identify and test potential

strategies for improving recovery of fish released from different gear. Specifically, we will evaluate the use of a

flow-through box, in-river holding pen, and soft-mesh sack to facilitate recovery of fish by coupling

physiological approaches with field-based telemetry studies. We will also provide fishers with tools for

assessing fish condition easily and reliably by validating and refining the use of reflex impairment indicators

(e.g., loss of equilibrium) as predictors of mortality. Such information would help fishers to decide when to

release and when to hold onto fish for recovery. Because all resource management issues must include a

thorough understanding and management of human (i.e. fisher) behaviour, we will also study the factors that

would influence fisher adoption and use of different recovery tools and the tradeoffs that they would be willing

to make with respect to different legislated or voluntary actions. Collectively, the proposed research will

provide information to management agencies to reduce uncertainty in current management approaches that

could provide fishers with increased fishing opportunities Moreover, credible scientific research and a more

thorough understanding of the human dimension should help to reduce conflict between stakeholders so that

efforts can focus on common goals such as ensuring that in-river Pacific salmon fisheries are sustainable.","P�che commerciale","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Fishery Industry","2 & 3","STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group",Ontario,Ontario

"Male sexual behavior is a rewarding behavior that consists of multiple elements, of which ejaculation appears to be the most rewarding. However, the neural pathways for relay of ejaculation-related sensory information to the brain are currently unclear. Recently, our laboratory identified one candidate pathway in the position to relay ejaculation-related signals from the pelvic organs to the brain, via the lumbar spinal cord. Specifically, a population of cells in the lumbar spinal cord that are involved in the control of ejaculation, form a nodal point in this spinothalamic pathway. These lumbar spinothalamic cells receive inputs from the reproductive organs and in turn provide inputs to a medial subdivision of the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus (SPFp; Coolen et al., 2003). This pathway contains multiple neuropeptides and transmitters and expresses neural activation only following ejaculation and not following other components of sexual behaviour, in support of its involvement in processing and relay of ejaculation-related signals (Coolen et al., 2003). Our long term goal is to better understand the functional significance of this spinothalamic pathway for male sexual behaviour. In particular, the significance of this pathway and the processing of sensory information related to ejaculation for sexual reward will be investigated in the current proposal.



The objectives of our proposal are to 1. further investigate the functional role of the neurotransmitters in the LSt-SPFp pathway and 2. test the involvement of SPFp efferents for sexual reward and behaviour. Studies in Aim 1 will determine the effects of infusions into the medial SPFp of ligands or antagonists to the receptors for the neurotransmitters expressed in this pathway, on the expression of sexual behaviour and the development of conditioned sexual reward. In Aim 2, the hypothesis that SPFp outputs to forebrain areas are critical for sex behavior and reward will be tested by activation of the SPFp. Together, these studies will fill an important gap in our understanding of the neural circuits mediating sexual behaviour and reward.

"Project Summary - The aim of this research program is to understand the mechanisms of how bacteria exploit their human and animal hosts during infection by using a specialized secretion apparatus called the type III secretion system. This secretion system acts like a molecular syringe to inject bacterial proteins directly into host cells so that the bacteria can commandeer the cell for it's own growth. Importantly, disabling the secretion system render the bacteria unable to infect their hosts. Our research program is focused on the type III secretion system of Salmonella enterica, a bacteria that infects many domesticated food animals in Canada and throughout the world and that causes serious gastrointestinal illness in the humans that it infects. Our work involves identifying and understanding the function of specialized bacterial proteins called chaperones that we believe orchestrate the assembly and function of the type III secretion system during infection. This work will define key mechanisms of how bacteria use chaperone protein networks to ultimately cause disease in humans and animals. 

Impact and Outcomes - This research has importance for all Canadians concerned about food and water safety. Because protein chaperones have essential conserved functions in type III secretion, we believe that we can eventually disable bacterial pathogens in humans and animals by targeting chaperone activity. Knowledge from this research will also bring increased understanding of all type III secretion-containing bacteria. Getting to this point requires in-depth research into chaperone structure and function that will have an impact in the fields of infectious diseases and agriculture in Canada and abroad. In addition, this research program represents an outstanding opportunity for biochemistry trainees at the graduate and undergraduate levels who learn cutting-edge technologies in the life sciences, leaving them with marketable high-tech skills for future advancement in the sciences, whether in academia, government, or private sectors.

"Cells of the immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes, sense their environment using an array of specialized surface receptors. Upon binding a suitable foreign substance, these receptors generate intracellular signals, allowing the cell to respond appropriately to a given stimulus. During cellular stimulation, surface receptors (such as the T and B cell receptors - TCR and BCR) are commonly observed to reorganize their movement and location. For example, TCR and BCR are observed to form sub-micrometer clusters on the cell surface. Our understanding of how receptor signaling leads to changes in receptor motion, and how these dynamic changes affect subsequent signaling, is a key part of our knowledge of the processes governing lymphocyte activation. 



This proposal focuses on the use of single particle tracking (SPT) as a tool to probe the spatial dynamics of lymphocyte surface receptors. We will develop experimental and theoretical tools and perform a program of experiments designed to shed light on the relationship between receptor signaling and receptor dynamics on the cell surface. To perform the experiments, we will label individual receptors with a fluorescent tag and track the movements of individual molecules using  microscopy.  Motion data will then be analyzed using novel statistical approaches already under development. These experiments will allow us to clearly understand the strengths and limitations of SPT in this context. 



The information from these experiments will advance our basic understanding of immune cell activation. This is important in understanding autoimmune diseases and the immune response to viruses, for instance. Further, certain classes of drugs work in a way that mimics part of the immune system, and understanding the physical parameters that govern this may become an important part of designing new drugs.

"Fisheries and ecosystem scientists are often given the role of determining whether a population or ecosystem is healthy for input into conservation and management decisions such as endangered species listings, setting fishing regulations, or permitting for activities such as mining or forestry. For populations, we rely on indicators such as abundance and mortality rates.  We could also include factors such as disease prevalence and toxic chemical concentrations.  With ecosystems, there are numerous potential indicators such as species richness, food-web complexity, and productivity.  However, there is little guidance as to the correct cut-off between healthy and unhealthy for each indicator or how to combine results from multiple indicators.  

     I propose to learn from the experience of medical researchers, who have been dealing with this very issue for decades.  When performing clinical trials to develop a new indicator and reference point for healthy versus unhealthy (e.g., for a new illness), there is often no way to definitively determine whether the test patients have the disease.  Statistical methods such as latent class models allow them to determine the cut-offs while taking into account the fact that the cost of a misdiagnosis can be high and asymmetric.  A healthy person may get unnecessary treatment, or an ill person may go untreated.  These models can then be applied to new patients to estimate the probability they are ill based on a suite of indicators. 

     The goal of this proposal is to adapt and apply these methods from medical science to the challenges being faced by fisheries and aquatic ecosystem scientists in conservation and management contexts.  Despite not being able to definitively determine the health status of our test populations and ecosystems, we will develop indicators and reference points which can then be used to estimate the probability that a population or ecosystem is in an unhealthy state, taking into account the asymmetric costs of a mistake.  This will help us better understand the factors related to population and ecosystem health, and will help us make more informed decisions as to when action or increased monitoring is needed.

"The idea for this application started last year when a representative of Canadian General Tower Ltd. approached us about our research with plasticizer degradation.  They are particularly interested in the development of safer plasticizers to be added to polyvinylchloride formulations (PVC) which they use in many applications.  Plasticizers are low molecular weight organic compounds that are essential for effective processing and tailoring of properties in plastics.  It has been well established that these compounds leach from plastics during use and upon disposal.  Significant concerns about the use of these compounds have been raised recently because of their negative impacts on organisms.  Furthermore, these compounds are degraded into toxic metabolites, which are persistent in the environment and we have observed several of them in samples taken from a variety of urban and industrial sites.  These results foreshadow increases in the regulation of the use of traditional plasticizers. Such developments will be particularly problematic given the large-scale importance of plasticizers in the production of a wide variety of products.  We propose to develop ""green"" plasticizers that would impart all of the desirable characteristics as effectively and economically as do conventional plasticizers in plastics formulations, but would be intrinsically non-toxic, incapable of generating toxic and persistent intermediates during degradation and would not leach out to a significant extent during use or after disposal.  We have identified certain organic compounds that are similar in structure to commercially available plasticizers but which certain chemical characteristics that play a pivotal role in the production of hazardous degradation products.  In collaboration with our industrial partner, Canadian General-Tower candidate plasticizers will be synthesized, if necessary, tested and characterized to ensure that they are compatible with normal formulations and impart the desired material properties, are themselves environmentally benign and are transformed by common microorganisms and mammalian cells into non-toxic products.

"The bones of land animals (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) are living organs with the ability to respond to changes in the physical demands placed upon them.  This mechanism, known as 'functional adaptation', acts to ensure that bones are optimized to be sufficiently strong but not unnecessarily heavy.  Adaptation can involve both changes in the overall shape of bones (modeling) as well as internal modification of the bone tissue (remodeling).  My research program focuses on the latter process - remodeling - which is the primary mechanism of change in mature bones after growth has ceased.  The overarching aims of my research are to better understand how and why the microscopic architecture of the dense outer (cortical) shell of bones is modified under normal and modified loading conditions.  A key innovation of my research is the use of high magnification three-dimensional imaging technology (micro-CT) capable of visualizing bone microarchitecture down to a cellular level.  Within the current phase of my research, specific projects are focused on understanding 1) the relationship between microscopic structure and loading patterns within individual bones, 2) the organization of individual cellular-level remodeling events and 3) the effect of altered loading on microscopic structure.  Ultimately, my research program will advance our knowledge regarding the biology of bones and will provide an important new opportunity for interpreting the function of bones in both present and past species.  The data generated will have wide ranging applications in bone research including understanding bone as a 'material' (engineering) and understanding the evolution of bone as a tissue (palaeontology).  Further, a number of human bone diseases are related to the remodeling process (e.g. osteoporosis).  Therefore, improving our understanding of the normal function of remodeling and how this process evolved may provide vital clues that will improve our capacity to combat bone disease in the future.

"There is an increasing interest in the production of bacteriophages (phages), which can be used directly in phage therapy, diagnostics and as antibacterial agents and can also be used to produce recombinant proteins, which can be used as pharmaceuticals and in agriculture and food applications. The large scale production of phages is difficult. Self-cycling fermentation (SCF) was developed in my laboratories and is a method of growing microbes continuously, in synchronous culture. The work proposed here is an adaptation of SCF to significantly improve the production of phages. The research will apply a cycling strategy to the production of phages and, eventually, recombinant proteins having phages as vectors and adopt a novel control strategy which simplifies SCF and optimizes the production. The system will be developed as two independently cycling bioreactors. The first stage is used for the growth of the host and operates as a normal self-cycling fermentor (SCF). The second stage is used for the infection of the host by the phage and is called the self-cycling infection chamber (SCIC).

An improvement over the original SCF control system is to use the analysis of CO2 levels in the exit gas. Preliminary work has show that this can capture all of the important features of both growth and the infection process. By analogy to normal SCF operation, this overall process is expected to be robust, reliable, and versatile (i.e. operational under various infection strategies). Another advantage of the SCF/SCIC is the possibility of obtaining a synchronized host population before its transfer into the SCIC. This would allow the age of the host at the time of infection to be used as a manipulated parameter. An important long term goal will be to use genetically modified phages, which can produce recombinant proteins. In the past, the use of phage for recombinant protein production has been discounted because of the difficulties in achieving large scale production of the phage. The SCF/SCIC will solve this crucial problem and make this approach feasible.

"The sustainable use of wood based products depends on their long term and effective performance in a wide range of environmental exposures.  Properties of wood that affect its performance, such as decay resistance, dimensional stability, fire resistance and weathering performance, depend on the physical and chemical nature of the cell wall components of the hollow wood fibres.  These physical and chemical properties can be changed through treatments whereby inorganic or organic substances in solution are pressure impregnated into the cell lumens or void spaces from which some of the dissolved substances may diffuse into the cell walls. The long-term efficacy of the treatments may be enhanced by strategically reacting or fixing the substances within the cell wall structure.  Examples of efficacious inorganic treatments are borates against fungi, insects and fire, phosphates against fire and copper and zinc against micro-organisms. Non metallic substances such as organic wood preservatives and soluble monomers and polymers can also be effective treatments to protect or stabilize wood.   Since all modes of wood deterioration are related to physico-chemical changes occurring in the cell walls, it is evident that the amount and distribution of protecting chemicals in the wood substance should affect their performance.  However, relatively little is known about the relative rates of diffusion of these substances from the penetrated void space of the wood, into the cell wall material nor of their equilibrium distributions and configurations in the cell wall matrix.  The objective of the proposed work is to develop an understanding of the diffusion and reaction of different components in the wood microstructure and their micro-distribution and configuration in the cell walls, as affected by compound or ion type, processing conditions and chemical properties of the wood.  Potential benefits of the proposed work include developing approaches to enhancing the performance and effectiveness of chemically treated wood and improving our understanding of cell wall structure and conformation of substances in the cell walls.

Advances in technological developments and proven consumer demand for renewable energy technologies have reached a point where the widespread adoption of these products has become a realistic option for planning objectives. The ollaborative project described in this proposal, between researchers at the University of British Columbia and Turquoise Technology Solutions, will develop geospatial tools and products to facilitate informed decision-making regarding renewable energy strategies at all levels of government, the private sector and residential users. Specifically, the research proposed here will address solar resource assessment, since solar radiation is the direct driver of many renewable energy technologies (i.e. solar, wind, biomass). In this project, we will merge digital elevation models across Canada to provide the necessary topographic parameters to determine the impact of slope and aspect on fine scale radiation parameters. Using a

suite of existing algorithms we will then modify the potential radiation loads across Canada at a fine spatial resolution using the digital terrain data and attenuate these values as a function of the atmospheric transmissivity. These values vary according to cloudiness and optical air mass parameters associated with elevation, and will be made available using an historical cloud climatology data developed by Turquoise Technology. The output of the project will consist of spatial estimates, across Canada, of the actual radiation intercepted by the Earth's surface, over the past 30 years, which are critical for future investment in solar technologies.","Autres ressources d'�nergie","Ressources d'�nergie","Pacific Internal Decision Committee",1,"EGP   ","Engage Grants Program                                                                               ","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

Monitoring of plant photosynthesis is a critical component to understanding the terrestrial carbon cycle, and requires a detailed understanding of the vegetated land surface. Remote sensing is the ideal technology to observe vegetation characteristics in a spatially continuous mode, however variations in vegetation growth over space and time, requires additional information on soil water and nutrient status and climate. This research program will develop functional relationships between vegetation reflectance (indicative of vegetation functioning), plant light use efficiency (Rue) and coincident measurements of carbon and water fluxes. Our approach focuses on the determination and monitoring of Rue using the remote sensing derived photochemical reflectance index (PRI, (based on canopy reflectance at 531 and 570 nm) and other spectral indices. Modeling Rue at the canopy scale is not straightforward, as PRI is a function of both directional reflectance and plant physiological status. To address these complexities, we have designed and built an innovative, tower-mounted sensor (AMSPEC) which scans the top of the canopy to record changes, every 15 seconds, in leaf functioning. 



This project will follow a number of critical lines of inquiry. We will use our current structural reflectance model for PRI (and thus Rue) and scale up from the tower to the surrounding area using airborne spectrographic imagery. With spectral bands matching the tower sensor, we will be able to develop a spatially and temporally explicit model of carbon uptake. We will also build a second generation AMSPEC (II) with multiple scan angles to more effectively view the canopy and derive a more comprehensive and accurate model. AMSPEC II will be mounted in a boreal forest stand, representing a globally important biome which is potentially highly sensitive to climate changes. Once developed these observations will help quantity and monitor the carbon cycle at landscape and regional scales.

"Secretion, the release of stored compounds, is a fundamental cellular process essential for numerous actions including nervous system function, release of hormones and insulin, and wound healing.  Unfortunately, the essential cellular machinery has yet to be fully resolved.  The final, defining release step itself requires fusion of the storage compartment (vesicle) and the cell membrane, so that the contents of the compartment can leave the cell.  The mechanism of this fusion step, and its regulation, remain largely undefined.  It is clear however that both lipid and protein components in the membranes act together in native fusion.  Nonetheless, detailed mapping and mechanistic studies of lipid functions in native calcium-triggered fusion have not advanced as effectively as have protein-directed studies.  

As these basic cellular mechanisms are conserved, I use a simple native membrane preparation, isolated in its 'fusion-ready' state, to identify critical lipidic components.  No other preparations are available for experiments of comparable focus.  My group has already identified cholesterol as a critical component of the fusion mechanism.  In addition, we have developed highly sensitive new assays to quantitatively assess lipids, and a variety of new tools and techniques to manipulate the effective levels of specific lipids in the vesicle membrane.  We now have two specific goals: (i) to characterize the physical nature of the fully docked state of release-ready vesicles at the plasma membrane (e.g. are they already partially fused); and (ii) identify other critical lipids and their specific influences on vesicle docking, calcium-sensing, fusion, or the kinetics of the mechanism.  Such a fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms of secretion is essential if we are to safely and selectively target this process to modify function.

"The central aim of the proposed research program is to improve understanding of the extent to which glaciers in northern Canada are responding to climate change. When the climate warms, glaciers generally experience greater surface melting and lose mass via increased meltwater runoff. This process has been well-studied, and forms the basis of the sea-level change estimates provided in the major current climate impact assessments (e.g., Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2001; Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, 2004). A second impact is that increased surface melting may provide more water to the interior and bed of glaciers, which in turn could lead to an increase in glacier surface motion. The nature of this response is currently poorly understood, and the impact of changes in glacier dynamics is almost completely ignored in climate impact assessments. This omission may be a significant shortcoming as improper accounting of changes in glacier fluxes may lead to an underestimation of future sea-level rise. This is because a widespread acceleration of glaciers would move more ice to lower elevations where it can melt more quickly, and move more ice directly to the oceans (in locations where there are tidewater glaciers). This is of particular concern for northern Canada because the glaciers and ice caps there contain the largest volumes of ice in the world outside of Greenland and Antarctica, their small size means that they may respond more quickly to changes than the large ice sheets, and future climate warming is predicted to be greatest in the high latitudes.

        This proposal will address this knowledge gap by making detailed ice motion and mass balance measurements on the Kaskawulsh Glacier in the Yukon and on Devon Ice Cap in the Canadian High Arctic, and establishing their links to both climate and non-climate related forcings. With improved understanding of the processes driving glacier flow, it will be possible to establish how these forcings may alter under a changing climate, and in turn how glaciers may respond dynamically to climate change.

"The central aim of the proposed research program is to improve understanding of the extent to which glaciers in northern Canada are responding to climate change. When the climate warms, glaciers generally experience greater surface melting and lose mass via increased meltwater runoff. This process has been well-studied, and forms the basis of the sea-level change estimates provided in the major current climate impact assessments (e.g., Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2001; Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, 2004). A second impact is that increased surface melting may provide more water to the interior and bed of glaciers, which in turn could lead to an increase in glacier surface motion. The nature of this response is currently poorly understood, and the impact of changes in glacier dynamics is almost completely ignored in climate impact assessments. This omission may be a significant shortcoming as improper accounting of changes in glacier fluxes may lead to an underestimation of future sea-level rise. This is because a widespread acceleration of glaciers would move more ice to lower elevations where it can melt more quickly, and move more ice directly to the oceans (in locations where there are tidewater glaciers). This is of particular concern for northern Canada because the glaciers and ice caps there contain the largest volumes of ice in the world outside of Greenland and Antarctica, their small size means that they may respond more quickly to changes than the large ice sheets, and future climate warming is predicted to be greatest in the high latitudes.

"Cell adhesion is a complex process that plays a fundamental role in the growth and differentiation of cells in multicellular organisms.   In particular, cell adhesion has profound influence over the survival of dells within tissues and organs and can also significantly impact many pathological conditions.  Cell adhesion is the process by which cells attach and spread on protein-based structures outside the cell (the extracellular matrix).  Such interactions affect cell shape, intracellular structures and biochemical reactions and gene expression.  The long-term goals of my research are to examine the intracellular, molecular machinery that specifically regulates cell adhesion.  In doing this, I intend to establish a research program that will contribute to the basic understanding of these biological functions within cells.



Within the long-term goals of my research program, the research proposed in this application contains three specific aims: 1) to define the role that restructuring of cell membranes plays in the processes of cell adhesion; 2) to analyse proteins which function to regulate the membrane restructuring that is involved in cell adhesion and 3) identify cellular regulators of these activities.  I plan to examine the functions of proteins that control cell adhesion, proteins that regulate the restructuring of cell membranes and proteins that regulate the cell's internal ""skeleton"" (the actin cytoskeleton).  I expect to uncover how proteins with these diverse functions work together within cells to control cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and ultimately affect cell behaviour.  This research will involve the use of cultured cell types, modern biological techniques to perform experiments on living cells, high-resolution microscopy and biochemical analyses. Collectively, these approaches will allow the direct examination of protein function during cell adhesion and will yield results that hold wide significance in the disciplines of cell biology and biochemistry.

"It is well known that exercise can improve cardiovascular function and reduce the likelihood of developing heart disease, diabetes and stroke. However, new research has shown that exercise can improve ""brain health"". Animals that are exposed to periods of regular exercise show improvements in learning and memory (cognitive abilities) compared to those that are inactive.  How exercise improves brain function is not clear. However, several molecules important for growth of new connections in the brain and for growing new blood vessels appear to be particularly sensitive to exercise. In our research we are investigating these and other mechanisms using animal models of exercise that closely approximate human exercise patterns so that findings from the animal models can be more easily translated to humans. An especially novel aspect of our research is that we are exposing animals to a series of challenging mental activities (similar to solving puzzles in humans) that we think will cause changes in the brain similar to those produced by physical exercise. If this is the case then the combination of physical activity and mental stimulation may provide an optimal method for maintaining cognitive abilities throughout life.","Sant� publique (y compris recherche psychologique li�e � la m�decine)","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Newfoundland and Labrador",Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador
"Aluminium based automotive heat exchangers are produced by furnace brazing a structure which is assembled by stacking, formed Al sheets. The Al sheets contain a coating which consists of a low melting point Al alloy. During brazing this coating melts and creates a fusion joint at the contact points between sheets. Since the core of the sheets do not melt, the brazing process creates a completely joined 3-D honeycomb structure ideal for heat exchange applications.

     Dana Canada-Long Manufacturing has developed a unique Ni-based fluxless brazing method for producing the fusion joint in Al alloy radiators. To remain competitive in the increasingly global automotive market place Dana Canada must continually improve manufacturing efficiency and innovation. 

     The purpose of this project is to use advanced high temperature thermal analysis tools, developed at the University of Waterloo, to achieve a fundamental understanding of the Ni-based fluxless brazing process used by Dana. More specifically the applicant's research team will develop quantitative methods, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), to quantify the amount of liquid formed, its transient nature and the role Ni plays in the brazing process. Liquid and Ni content are important aspects of creating a good joint and in determining the final surface microstructure, corrosion resistance and thermal conductivity of the manufactured heat exchanger. The research will also develop a novel technique for measuring the thermal properties of a braze joint during heating. This will allow an assessment of joint quality as well as provide important thermal data needed to assess the manufacturing operation and heat exchanger performance in an automotive application. 

     The insight produced by this work will allow Dana Canada Corporation to make informed decisions in their pursuit of a more efficient, cost effective and higher performance automotive heat exchanger manufacturing process. This will ultimately increase the strength of the Canadian automotive sector as a whole and therefore benefit the Canadian economy.

"High temperature intermetallic compounds and metal-ceramic composites are difficult and costly to process using conventional casting, forming and machining routes due to their high melting temperature, high hardness and limited ductility. The fabrication of these materials through pressing and sintering of powders has the advantage of the fabrication of near net shape parts, reducing the need for forming and machining. For the specific case of reactive sintering (RS), the use of a mixture of relatively low cost pure powders, which react during sintering to form the desired compounds or composites, has the added benefits of lower processing temperatures and economic production. However RS suffers for the production of a porous, inhomogeneous finished product which has limited the commercial application of this technology. Our recent studies on RS of NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) has revealed that low sintered densities result from the development of a poorly distributed liquid phase which becomes isolated into discontinuous ""pockets"". 



In this proposal, novel reactive liquid phase (RLP) processing will be developed with the aim of achieving high densities and increased homogeneity in a sintered part made from pure powders. The Ni + Ti system will serve as a test case. Cu will be added as a liquid phase sintering aid and a novel selection of Ni, Ti and Cu powder sizes will be used to create a well distributed, continuous liquid phase. This liquid will densify the mixture and accelerate the reaction between Ni and Ti to produce CuNiTi ternary SMA as the final product. This novel RLP approach will be further developed to create new CuNiTi-TiC composites through the addition of carbon powder to the original Cu, Ni, Ti mixture. The successful development of the RLP process will lead to a breakthrough in reactive sintering technology thus increasing its use in commercial applications. Economically produced, high density CuNiTi SMA and CuNiTi-TiC composites will have applications in important sectors of the Canadian economy including the automotive, tool and die and mining industries.

"The goal of the Smart Internet initiative is to move beyond the present paradigm of manual navigation and combination of internet services and interactions in the Web Browser, to a new world in which the internet interface can automatically personalize and combine services and interfaces to match the interests, workstyle and personal goals of each user.

      The initiative involves two specific areas of research: Smart Interactions, which addresses factors that impact the discovery, aggregation and the delivery of resources and content from the internet that concentrates on the users and their tasks, and Smart Services, which addresses the enabling computing infrastructure needed to support Smart interactions - their requirements, functions and relationships.  Each of these poses a range of research challenges that crosses disciplines, methods and technologies that will require the collaboration of researchers with many different kinds of expertise.

      Canada is in a unique position to explore and map the future of the Smart Internet, due to the small set of existing research projects already underway in collaboration with the IBM Center for Advanced Studies in Toronto, where the Smart Internet was originally proposed, and to the presence of a number of top international researchers whose expertise will be critical to advancing the state of the art.  In order to make the quantum leap that is required, it is clear that this is a much larger challenge than can be taken on by one small group, and will require cross-disciplinary research in a range of areas.  

      The purpose of this workshop is to bring together key researchers and practitioners in a range of related areas from across Canada in order to organize and focus the research directions and challenges of the Smart Internet initiative, as the first step in the creation of a national strategic network.

"My research program, which focuses on the function of chemical signals, is aimed at understanding how male and female fish communicate. Round gobies exhibit an advanced form of chemical signalling in fishes. The proposed research will provide important insights into chemical communication during courtship and spawning of the invasive fish, the round goby, through analysis of pheromone signals released in the urine and odours released from embryos. I will determine if reproductive male and female round gobies control the release of their urine (and correspondingly, their sex pheromones) to signal their readiness to spawn. The parental male occupies a nest, releases a sex attractant that lures gravid females to the nest to deposit eggs which he fertilizes, maintains and guards. Nest-holding males actively disperse their urine (urine that contains a novel attractant) from nests using fin movements. By analyzing visible flow fields using particle image velocimetry, we will track odour plumes to determine their speed and distance travelled. We will describe the mating system of the round goby by determining if other males enter the nest and sneak fertilizations without the cost associated with care of the fertilized eggs. Field observations, manipulative experiments and genetic analysis will enable us to determine if parental male round gobies rear offspring that are fathered by other males. Reliability of parental male traits, chemical signals, nest cues and time since egg deposition will be evaluated to determine reproductive success of paternal males given the likelihood of sneakers. Cannibalism of eggs may be a function of both breeding condition and relatedness. Odours from embryos may serve as a lure to attract round gobies to feed on embryos, especially when food is limiting. If sex pheromones and egg odours serve as stimuli to attract large numbers of round gobies, these techniques could potentially be used in the management and control of the round goby, a species known to have detrimental effect on native fishes.",Environnement,Environnement,"Evolution & Ecology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"An attosecond (or 1/1,000,000,000,000,000,000 of a second) lasts an almost inconceivably short time.  However, many things that are important for our lives happen that fast.  For example, an attosecond is just a bit faster than the time that it takes for an electron to orbit an atom or molecule. One aim of attosecond science is to understand and control these electrons.  



Not surprisingly, attosecond pulses are created by controlling electrons in the simplest material --- an atom.  We control them with an intense light beams that illuminates the atom.  First the light beam detaches one of the atom's own electrons.  Then, like a hand pulling a stone in a sling shot, the light pulse pulls the electron away from the atom.  Soon, however, the electron is driven back, like releasing the stone from the sling shot.  While the stone passes through the yoke of the sling shot, at the last moment the electron collides with the atoms it just left.  The collision spins off an attosecond pulse.  



About two years ago we found a method to photograph electrons.  This may sound like science fiction but up to the limit that science allows we can now ""see"" the electron.  So, attosecond science opens a path to taking real-time 3-D movies of electrons as they change during a chemical reaction.  



With methods for taking pictures and for measuring processes that used to be too fast to measure, attosecond science will be useful everywhere where electrons play a large role.  The impact of this new field of study will extend well beyond multiphoton physics, touching chemistry and biology.  It opens new ways to measure fast processes, new ways to image electrons and atoms in molecules and new ways to control electrons.

"Symplectic topology is one of the fields of modern mathematics that has seen an extraordinary development in the last 30 years. Its origin come from physics - for example from the classical problem of the stability of the solar system - and various physical concepts continue to motivate its modern evolution. The present proposal is concerned with a number  unexpected rigidity properties of some particular spaces - called Lagrangian submanifolds. These spaces are (very extensive !) generalizations of the real numbers viewed as a subset of the complex ones. To have an idea of a typical and very simple rigidity property imagine the reals as a straight line going through the origin in the plane. Suppose that we apply to the plane a transformation which preserves area and which leaves the real line constant outside the interval (-1,1) and which leaves fixed all the points in the plane whose distance from the origin exceeds some fixed large, positive constant K. A moment of thought will show that the image of the reals by this transformation has to intersect the real line inside the interval (-1,1): the real line is thus rigid in the sense that these intersection points can not be avoided when using area preserving transformations of this sort. The types of rigidity considered in this project are considerably subtler and more complicated phenomena. They are also related to various other parts of mathematics: complex analysis, partial differential equations and topology. Altogether this makes for a fascinating subject of investigation !

"The global long-term goals of this research program are: (1) to develop new radiochemical analytical techniques and (2) to apply improved radiometric techniques for dating environmental samples from the Quaternary.  The determination of the age of environmental samples is not simple when events are older than recorded history; yet it is fundamental to many aspects of environmental science.  Historical chronologies of many environmental processes can be developed by aging samples.  For example, atmospheric and groundwater transport, as well as rock and sediment ages, interpreted using geochemical theories, can be used to reconstruct temporal trends, to determine rates of environmental change, and to test models of environmental processes.



Radiometric dates can be obtained using either the radioactive decay of a nucleus or the rate of production of a given isotope by a nuclear reaction that occurs at a constant and known rate.  The dating of many young Quaternary samples has proven difficult because high precision measurements on closed systems are not possible.  In older systems, accurate dates often prove difficult because most 14C has already decayed or the initial activity is uncertain, and other techniques often violate the requirements of a closed system.  This research will provide new ways to measure radionuclides and more robust dating techniques for Quaternary materials covering a wide range of ages.  



These techniques will be used to in environmental assessments, climate change studies,  ecological impact statements and other applications where it is important to look at the longer term behaviour of a system and the impact of human and natural events on that system.

"The aging population and the increased sophistication of the Canadian consumer has resulted in an increased effort in designing food products not only pleasing to the palate, but also imparting additional health benefits. Milk and dairy products are common items present in the refrigerator of Canadian families, and often seen as traditional products. These represent optimal delivery systems for health-enhancing compounds, provided that the texture and quality of the products can be maintained. So, it is important to design better dairy products that will deliver health benefits additional to those traditionally associated with milk. This becomes even more critical if we think that in 2005 there are more than 400 dairy processing plants in Canada (Canadian Dairy Information Center, www.dairyinfo.gc.ca), representing a significant portion of the Canadian economy. 



We propose a research program that focuses on the design of novel structures from milk proteins with the following objectives:  1) to incorporate soluble fiber in structured dairy products and   2) to create novel particles from milk proteins which could be used as delivery systems of health-enhancing compounds. These objectives cover some important challenges in the development of new low-fat, high protein and high fiber products. The effect of selected polysaccharides on the interactions with milk proteins will be studied, with particular attention to how the interactions will affect the formation of milk gels, as this has important consequences in the design of dairy products. In addition, we will look at the potential application of protein-polysaccharides aggregates as funcitional ingredients in foods. The potential for preparing delivery systems using milk protein aggregates as platforms will also be  investigated in this program. 

The fundamental research underlined in this proposal will allow the incorporation of substances beneficial to our health in dairy products, without compromising (and hopefully improving) their quality. As a consequence, milk production and processing will continue to be an important part of the Canadian economy.

"This request is for funds to acquire a microplate reader for high throughput assays requiring absorption, fluorescence or related detection methods. Unique to a microplate reader are i) its automated operation, ii) low sample requirements and iii) the flexibility arising from the multiple detection modes it operates with. 



The automated microplate reader allows multiple (up to 1,536) assays to be run in parallel. Experiments that would otherwise require seven months to be completed in a standard 1 sample/cuvette spectrometer (7 months x 200 hs/month = 1400 hs) can be done in no more than one hour in the microplate reader. The small sample requirements, which are in the microliter volume range and picomolar to micromolar concentration range further enable studies to be performed on rare, difficult to isolate or synthesize molecules/biomolecules. Finally the multiple detection modes of the microplate reader give access to a number of techniques the co-applicants require in their every day operation. The microplate reader detection modes include: UV-visible absorbance, fluorescence intensity, time-resolved fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, luminescence, resonance energy transfer in its many forms (FRET, TR-FRET, BRET), and spectral scanning. 



The microplate reader will be physically located in the Department of Chemistry at McGill University. Dedicated use of the microplate reader is absolutely essential to the four co-applicants, their students and PDFs. The instrument is to be utilized by other researchers from McGill Chemistry Department. In respect to the co-applicants, the instrument supports research programs in drug discovery, novel sensors and reporters, biophysical studies on protein-DNA interactions, research into free radical sensors, and development of novel therapeutics.

"Images provide the way to visualize our surrounding macroscopic environment. Images can also help us visualize and ultimately understand what occurs at the microscopic and nanoscopic (a billionth of a meter) level. We refer to chemical imaging as our ability to visualize processes at the cellular or molecular level using advanced techniques and specific chemical probes. Herein we take advantage of the interaction of light with a small molecule, or the emission of radiation from a small molecule, to ultimately visualize and interrogate, in a non invasive manner and over long period of times, tissues, cells, cellular activity, concentration of chemical species within a cell, biomacromolecular interactions, etc. 

Motivated by our interest in understanding the chemical basis behind cellular mechanisms we propose to develop a novel platform of ""smart"" molecules and supramolecular architectures to visualize and quantify: i) chemical composition, ii) chemical interactions and iii) macromolecular structure in the cell/tissue. Specifically we will develop: I) probes for monitoring reactive oxygen species. II) Novel supramolecular structures for studying lipid membrane-protein interactions and for high throughput membrane binding analysis. III) Fast methodologies for preparing molecules capable of emitting radiation (containing C11 isotope). 

In our quest to elaborate new advanced probes we will generate fundamental knowledge in the chemistry and photophysics of luminescent materials as well as in the chemistry of reactive chemical intermediates such as peroxyl radicals and carbanions. This knowledge will be capitalized in generating novel imaging strategies which in turn will enable a further understanding on the chemical basis behind cellular mechanisms. 

The research conducted will promote new opportunities for the Canadian biomedical research and the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry.

"An insurance company submits itself to an important risk by subscribing a high number of insurance policies. To avoid facing financial difficulties in the future, insurance companies must be able to have an adequate appraisal of the financial health of their institution. For that purpose, risk theory can be used to measure the global risk of a portfolio of insurance contracts. This evaluation can be made with short term models over a fixed period of time and with long term models. With long term models, the global risk can be assessed by examining the evolution of the surplus process over several periods, either on a discrete or continuous time basis. In such a case, ruin theory is most oftenly used to accomplish this task. The description of the characteristics of the surplus process has relied traditionally on an assumption of independence between the amount of claims and the interarrival times. In many applications, this assumption is inadequate and generalizations with a dependence structure is needed to avoid a misevaluation of the global risk faced by an insurance company. In my research program, I will propose and include different dependence constructions which can be observed in practice in risk models. Both discrete and continuous time risk models will be considered. Different quantities such as the ruin probability, the surplus immediately prior to ruin and the deficit at ruin are of interest in the assessment of the risk of an insurance portfolio.  The unified approach based on the Gerber-Shiu penalty function will be used to study these ruin related quantities in the extensions proposed. The possibility of dividend payments to shareholders and investment income will also be studied within the suggested risk models with dependence. 

The accomplishment of my research program will provide tools for actuaries to evaluate more adequatly the global risk of an insurance portfolio when a long term based model with a dependence structure between interarrival times and claim amounts is called for. This will also allow them to have a better understanding of the risk faced by insurance companies.

"In magnetic systems when the temperature is lowered below the critical one there is a breaking of rotational symmetry leading to a magnetic stiffness of the magnetic moments. Because the systems resist twisting the magnetization locally, but don't resist a uniform twist, they have low energy spin wave excitations. Therefore, spin waves are propagating disturbances in the ordering of magnetic materials.  They are observed through experimental methods like: inelastic neutron scattering, inelastic light scattering (Brillouin scattering, Raman scattering and inelastic X-ray scattering), and others. From the practical point of view, the reciprocal of the lowest frequency of the characteristic spin waves of a magnetic material gives a time scale for the switching of a device based on that material and other constraints like geometry and presence of impurities. A fundamental understanding of the effect of geometry and impurities on low-dimensional magnetic structures is important for identifying their potential for e.g. high-frequency nanostructure devices and switches, as well as for an understanding of the basic science and the intrinsic materials properties. For example, thin magnetic films have impurities that affect their electronic properties.  Therefore manipulating these impurities can bring the possibility of new physical properties in these materials. Another experimentally feasible manipulation is the geometry of the magnetic structures. Several important phenomena have been detected and studied in planar trilayer magnetic structures. However, there are not many studies of trilayers in a cylindrical geometry. These two aspects of the low-dimensional magnetic system (impurities and geometry) will be investigated in this research project. The theoretical methods for this study include many body theory, classical electromagnetism, and Monte Carlo simulations. Non-magnetic systems, like for example carbon based materials, are also affected by impurities and geometry constraints. Therefore, to adapt the theoretical models developed for the magnetic systems is of great interest to better understand these systems. This is another aspect that will be covered by this proposal.

"My long term research program is to improve the imaging and manipulation of living cells as a natural application of my experience in laser physics and cellular microscopy. I intend to develop quantitative tools to systematically study the dynamics of protein-protein interactions, cell migration and development.

My short term research program aims to develop novel methods to engineer in vitro the spatial protein distributions found in vivo during key events in cellular processes of organisms. To test and understand the basic mechanisms that control cell guidance and migration we will mimic and manipulate these distributions.



During development, nerve cells first migrate and then extend processes for long distances exploring the environment to appropriately wire the nervous system. A clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying developmental processes will provide insight into engineering means to promote nerve regeneration.

The objective of reproducing these biochemical microenvironments requires the design of simple and reliable ways to fabricate protein patterns where the spatial distribution of chemoattractants and chemorepellants manipulate the cell response. 

The proposal consists of these specific aims:

1. To improve and characterize a laser based method to pattern proteins on culture substrates 

2. To fabricate multicomponent and three-dimensional protein patterns



Combinations of microscopies and new platforms to manipulate culture substrates will be developed with the aim of establishing standard methods. Engineering simpler protocols to make these techniques available to typical biological research laboratories is key to achieve the critical mass to develop major advances in the understanding of migration and guidance processes.

"Except for a few dystrophic diseases, injury to muscle-tendon unit is not a life threatening disease, but a very common problem in sports and in the work place. This class of injury accounts for 2,200,000 days of hospital care every year in Canada (Canadian Institute of Information). In USA, statistics released in 2001 at the American College of Sports Medicine meeting reveal that musculoskeletal disorders account for the loss of 21 millions school days and 147 millions work days. It was estimated that all this costs $250 billions a year. Consequently, 30 billions NSAID tablets are consumed every year. It is clearly one of the most neglected class of trauma in society. While preventive care measures have to be put forward, a better understanding of the mechanisms behind muscle tissue injury and repair will lead to a better management of these injuries and to more cost-effective treatments and strategies. Tissue healing is a carefully orchestrated series of cellular events involving inflammatory cells which must first leave the blood stream before they can interact in the injured tissue and lead to repair. In the present proposal, we intend to identify which cells can produce pro- or anti-inflammatory signals that contribute to the persistence or resolution of inflammation and those that can trigger tissue repair. We also want to characterize the time frame of implication for each one of these cells. In this proposal we will focuss more specifically on one type of immune cells, the mast cell. Our working hypothesis is that mast cells play key roles, not only in governing the inflammatory response, but also in modulating its resolution and the tissue repair phase. We will thus 1) Evaluate the importance of mast cell activation in modulating inflammatory cell invasion in muscle damage 2) Determine if mast cells help resolve inflammation through production of anti-inflammatory mediators and 3) Investigate the putative implication of mast cells in the regeneration phase of muscle healing and its mechanism of action. The model used in most cases is the injury in a hindlimb muscle of rat caused by injection of a toxic drug.

"Amongst all current imaging modalities, optical microscopy is the only method capable of probing live tissue with cellular and subcellular resolution and is the only one with a broad range of molecular contrast mechanisms. This versatility comes from the fact that light interacts well with molecules and consequently, contrasts based on density, absorption, fluorescence, and other advanced optical interactions are possible. Imaging strategies based on novel contrast mechanisms can be developed and integrated into current technology to enhance a biologist's toolbox, or can be developed into new imaging devices to enable innovative applications in life sciences. Our group stands at the interface between optical technologies and biology, and develops new modalities and devices for applications in life sciences, in particular for neuroscience. For instance, we are developing an optically-sectioned neuronal activity imaging microscope with wide field excitation that permits very fast imaging even in thick tissue for fundamental studies in neurobiology.  Also, we are developing imaging techniques based on laser technology that are complementary to techniques used today in medicine.  For example, since brain biopsies are not possible, we are developing a micro endoscope for imaging deep brain structures with minimal invasiveness and colateral damage.  Finally, we have developed a microscope that can image spinal cord and other tissues in live animals with a very high spatial resolution at video rates.  We are integrating it with our optical techniques for routine use in biology.","Sciences physiques","Avancement des connaissances","General Physics",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Sleep loss is a major problem in modern society. Many people willingly cut down on their sleep to make more time for work and social demands, while others cannot get the sleep they need because of shift work, normal aging, or sleep disorders. Sleep loss has immediate consequences for mood, alertness, productivity, and safety, leading to poor learning in schools, increased automobile accidents, and catastrophic industrial errors.  The most reliable finding from experimental studies is that sleep loss leads to slowed reaction time and deficits in sustained attention. A sleepy person may be able to perform with 100 percent accuracy at times; however, they will experience lapses in attention (that is, missed or delayed responses) which occur more frequently and for longer periods of time as the degree of sleep loss worsens. Researchers do not yet fully understand the brain basis of these behavioural lapses during sleep loss. Because of the type of performance deficits observed during sleepiness, researchers theorize that these deficits are related to dysfunction of the frontal brain regions. There is also some support for this from brain imaging studies. The goal of my current research is to understand how the brain controls behaviour during sleep loss using techniques like EEG and event-related potentials as measures of arousal and attention. Following 30 hours of total sleep deprivation, we will look at patterns of brain activity during performance of tasks involving frontal lobe function (e.g., working memory or processing novel stimuli). Moreover, we will investigate brain activity immediately prior to behavioural lapses in order to predict performance failure. We also aim to identify factors that predict who will be most vulnerable or resilient to sleep loss (e.g., age, gender, experience with sleep loss). Understanding how the brain controls rapid fluctuations in arousal and attention during a sleep loss challenge will improve our understanding of the role of sleep in waking function, and our understanding of brain function in general. Moreover, this research will lead to practical innovations for improving human productivity and safety under conditions of sleepiness.

"While cosmological models of structure formation now show excellent agreement with observations on the largest spatial scales, there remain serious discrepancies on the scales of galaxies and smaller. Unfortunately, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which galaxies were assembled into their present state ultimately hinges on astrophysical processes that are still poorly understood: i.e., gas cooling, star formation, and feedback from stars and active galactic nuclei.



The best way to understand how these processes unfolded over cosmic time scales is to carry out detailed studies of galaxies in the local universe. This proposal aims to build on such ongoing surveys, focusing on galaxies in the two nearest rich clusters (i.e., Virgo and Fornax), and in the halo of the Milky Way. Observations from a wide array of ground- and space-based facilities (i.e., from HST, CFHT, Keck, MMT, Magellan, Spitzer, KPNO, CTIO and Palomar) taken expressly for this purpose will be used to explore the formation of galactic nuclei and their connection to super-massive black holes, the nature and origin of galaxy scaling relations, and the connections to the smallest and faintest galaxies currently known: those in the outer halo of the Milky Way.

"Electronic properties of the collective states of a two-dimensional electron gas in a strong magnetic field



When a gas of electrons is confined, at very low temperature, into the lowest-energy state of a quantum well, it behaves as is it was effectively two-dimensional. This reduction in dimensionality increases the role of the coulombian interaction between electrons. When a strong magnetic field, perpendicular to the plane of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is added to the system, the energy of the electrons is further quantized into Landau levels. As the electrons fill these levels, a rich diversity of electronic states are observed experimentally. The most illustrious of these states are the Laughlin liquid states occurring at integer and some fractional fillings of the Landau levels where the electrons collectively ensemble themselves to produce an exact quantization of the Hall conductance. In this research project, we study other collective states of the 2DEG that occur away from the integer filling of the Landau levels: Wigner crystal, Skyrmion crystal, stripe and bubble phases. We also look at similar states that occur in the 2DEG formed in a double quantum well structure and in single layers of graphite. We study the energetics of these states as well as their collective excitations and experimental signature. We try to understand how the quantum confinement, coulombian interactions and quantum fluctuations conspire to give to these states their unique transport and electronic properties.

"The primary objective of this research is a theoretical study of the wave-like disturbances, known as collective excitations, that can occur in low-dimensional solid structures where typically the length scale in one or more of the dimensions may be as small as a few (or a few tens of) nanometres. The disturbances can, for example, be fluctuations in the magnetization (as in a spin wave or magnon), in atomic vibrations (as in phonons), or in electromagnetic fields (as in polaritons).  The types of structures of interest include thin films, multilayers (such as superlattices which have a regular repeat pattern or periodicity), nanowires, nanotubes and nanodots (either singly or formed in arrays).  All of these are capable of being fabricated to remarkable precision by modern growth techniques.  A common feature is that the waves or excitations are extensively modified due to the very small length scale and the boundary regions (the surfaces and interfaces) in such structures, and therefore may show properties quite different from those in bulk materials.  A fundamental understanding of these effects is important, both for the basic physics and for identifying their potential for applications (e.g, as high-frequency nanostructure devices and information storage devices).  I am interested in novel aspects concerned with the nonlinear dynamical properties of these structures and materials, i.e., in cases where the waves interact with one another.  This is in addition to the need for extending previous work in the linear (or noninteracting) regime to different materials and geometries (e.g. arrays of nanotubes and nanodots, or patterned surfaces).  The theoretical methods include the use of advanced analytical techniques (such as many-body theory and quantum field theory) and, in some cases, numerical simulations (such as quantum and classical Monte-Carlo methods).  Detailed applications will be made to inelastic light scattering and other experimental techniques for investigating the excitations in these systems.  A major emphasis in this project will be to linear and nonlinear spin waves in ordered magnetic materials, where interesting effects can occur because of spatial localization and competing types of interactions.

"What determines community structure and dynamics? This basic and ages-old question is still very relevant today and forms the basis of my research program. My work to date has clearly illustrated that integrating local environmental and spatial dispersal processes in the regulation of community structure through the metacommunity concept is absolutely necessary to capture all the important processes structuring local communities. This research provided some clear observational evidence for the recently developed metacommunity frame work that studies sites interconnected to each other through dispersing species. However, two other important ecological determinants, temporal processes and species traits, are currently only implicitly included in metacommunity theory. Explicitly incorporating them in the metacommunity framework will be an important step in determining the fundamental causes for local, spatial, and temporal metacommunity dynamics, the long term objectives of my research program. I will employ cladoceran communities in the hydrologically dynamic Peace-Athabasca Delta as a model system for testing specific hypotheses. I will focus for the next 5 years on: 1) the patterns and causes of short term temporal metacommunity dynamics within a season; 2) the patterns and causes of medium temporal metacommunity dynamics between seasons; and 3) how individual species traits ultimately cause these metacommunity dynamics. The first two projects are structured as two complete PhD projects, the third project as a series of Master and Undergraduate research projects. These projects use a combination of observational and experimental approaches, together with modern molecular techniques and state-of-the-art statistical analyses. These novel research questions and results will expand the mechanistic basis of metacommunity theory by including the important temporal processes and species traits. In addition, it will provide the rigorous scientific basis for predicting ecosystem responses during stresses and recovery because of climate change in the Peace-Athabasca Delta.

"Thermal energy conversion and management is a core technology that can strongly affect the advancement of applications including automotive, fuel cell, aerospace and waste heat recovery. Two-phase thermal management systems are required to precisely control temperature and minimize weight/size of the system per unit energy rejected. The reliability, predictive capability for design and transient control, however, are not readily available, especially in heat exchangers. Analysis capabilities are therefore required to assist in the design, development and optimization of advanced thermal management systems. The purpose of the proposed research is to develop expertise in 'smart' heat exchanger design and establish electrohydrodynamics (EHD) as the mechanism of intelligent control. EHD provides the ability to control heat exchanger and system preformance based on applied voltage conditions. 

The motivation for this research is the result of a critical need for innovative technologies to modulate waste energy conversion systems in order to provide a means to develop optimization strategies to improve efficiency. This will be accomplished by providing a proof of concept prototype compact heat exchanger designed and validated using the know-how and analysis capabilities developed through the course of this fundamental research program. The resulting knowledge base will provide Canadian heat exchanger manufacturers with the tools and intellectual property to design EHD heat exchangers and the required control strategy to modulate the thermal management system to ensure that devices function at the optimum operating conditions.  Most importantly, the successful development of an EHD heat exchanger that mitigates the challenges involving the dynamics of waste energy recovery systems will support the advancement of energy conservation through efficiency enhancement and optimization.

"Understanding the formation of cosmic structure, from the first stars at early epochs to the rich array of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the nearby universe, drives many aspects of contemporary astronomy. Recent observations of the relic microwave radiation from early in the universe tightly constrain the form of the tiny initial density fluctuations out of which these structures grew. My research focusses on the critical numerical models of cosmic evolution that connect these initial cosmic ripples with presently observed cosmic populations. Despite simple governing physics, the huge range of scales present and complex gravitational and hydrodynamic interactions means that detailed predictions require the indispensable experimental laboratory provided by numerical simulation.

    A key requirement for producing useful and accurate models of cosmic structure is the ability to undertake very high resolution simulations. I have been involved in many leading large-scale cosmological simulations and in the development of highly optimized numerical algorithms and now, with the recent installation of powerful supercomputers in Ontario, have the ability to undertake some of the most ambitious studies of cosmic structure to date.

    I am focussing on two specific aspects of structure formation: the formation of the first objects at early epochs and the formation and evolution of galaxies. The first objects and early stages of galaxy formation will over the next decade finally become accessible to new instruments and it is vital to provide detailed theoretical support to anticipate these observational programmes. The first objects set the stage for the formation of galaxies - the ``Holy Grail'' of cosmic structure studies. The group at McMaster has recently made significant progress in developing models of dwarf galaxies that incorporate realistic models for star formation and feedback that have resolved a key puzzle of the standard cosmic model. The challenge is now to understand the development of more massive galaxies and to chart the full history of comsic structure.

"Due to the increased awareness for global warming and for our individual impact on the environment, citizens

and government officials are looking for higher efficiency and environment-friendly alternatives to

incandescent lighting. The fluorescent lamp has become the prominent replacement for the traditional tungsten

filament bulb due to its significantly higher energy efficiency and service life. A typical incandescent light bulb

has a luminous efficacy of less than 20 lm/W and a typical service life of less than 500 hours. These numbers

now exceed 85 lm/W and 10000 hours with fluorescent lamps. On the other hand, the increased use of

fluorescent lamps displaces the problem from an energy efficiency issue to an environmental issue. According

to a study funded by the Canadian government, Canada recycled 4,279,300 mercury-containing lamps in 2004,

which is only 7% of the estimated total of 60 million mercury-containing lamps entering the waste stream each

year. The increase use of fluorescent lamps thus represents a significant additional source of Hg release in the

environment. The present research project aims at validating the operability of a low-pressure electrical

discharge lamp developed in our laboratory which makes use of carbon nanotube (CNT) array electrodes and a

mixture of Ar/H2O (or Ar/N2) as plasma gas. Such an electrical discharge lamp is proposed as an

environment-friendly and energy-efficient alternative to the standard Hg-containing lamp.","Produits de consommation","Proc�d�s et produits industriels","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"I2IPJ ","Idea to Innovation","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"This proposal presents a request for NSERC funds for the purchase of a Tabletop Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) system. This compact and easy to use microscope combines an optical microscope for a rapid, low-resolution imaging of samples (20x magnification), with an electron microscope which allows to resolve features as small as 50 nm (20,000x magnification). This instrument will be used to image the morphology of novel materials and coatings produced by the nine co-applicants and for training graduate students at the Masters and PhD levels as well as undergraduate in summer internships. Additional to the research and training potential of the instrument, the system will accelerate the sample evaluation process and will significantly reduce our user fees costs since a major fraction of the samples being investigated do not require the high-resolution capabilities of electron microscopes presently installed at McGill University.

"Two of the promising research and development activities initiated during the last five years of funding under a NSERC Discovery grant represent the core of the present research proposal: The development of a dual-plasma process for the synthesis of nanofluids (US patent pending), and the development of the Atmospheric Pressure Glow Discharge torch (APGD-t) for localized biomedical applications (US patent pending).



Nanofluids are regular fluids hosting a stable suspension of nanoparticles which enhance or give new heat transfer, optical, magnetic and electrical properties to the host fluid. The research and development activities aim at the development and/or improvement of plasma processes for the synthesis of nanofluids containing surface-stabilized metal nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes; the investigation of the effect of plasma processing parameters on the properties of the produced nanofluids; the characterization of the properties of the nanofluids; and the analysis of the mass/heat transport phenomena taking place inside such nanocomposite fluid via a novel laser-induced fluorescence imaging approach and computational modeling.



The interactions of the plasma jet produced by the APGD-t with biological surfaces are investigated. Of particular interest to us is the understanding of the newly-discovered phenomenon that cells can be momentarily permeabilized by the non-thermal plasma without necrosis. The miniature plasma torch designed and constructed under a NSERC I2I (Phase I) will be used for this work.

"Igneous and volcanic rocks play a central role in the make up of Canada's varied geology.  Magmatic activity in the form of volcanism, emplacement of magma into the Earth's crust and associated interaction between hot fluids and these rocks, play a key role in the formation of many varied and economically important mineral deposits, that help fund the nation's economy.  At the same time, the presence of volcanoes close to large cities, such as Vancouver, pose concerns in terms of potential natural hazards.  The study of igneous rocks and activity, therefore, is crucial in not only helping understand, identify and model the geological processes inherent in the generation of gold and other mineral deposits, but additionally and perhaps more significant in characterising cycles of volcanic activity and their estimated timeframes of operation.  This type of information can help in the prediction of volcanic eruptions.  To this background, this research program will study igneous rocks and the products of volcanism from parts of western Canada, Italy, and Colombia, to describe their nature and origins, and model the development of magmas.  It will utilise state-of-the-art analytical equipment in combination with field and laboratory investigations.  This project provides excellent training opportunities for 1 Ph.D. and 2 M.Sc.-level students in addition to supporting several undergraduate student research projects.  As such, it will train the highly qualified people needed to keep Canada at the forefront of Geoscience education, exploration and research.

"Our research program has three interrelated objectives. The first is to describe and understand the early development of important human visual functions such as spatial vision, color vision, and refraction. More recently, we have broadened this objective to include research on cognitive functions such as visual attention and memory.  An important feature of this work is our use of both behavioral (e.g. looking) and psychophysiological (e.g., heart rate) measures in the examination of infant attention. Where possible we also try to integrate findings from our research with neuroscience-based models of brain development. The second objective is to design new time-efficient psychophysical tests that measure visual functioning (e.g., contrast sensitivity, attention) in infants and children. We anticipate that these tests will also have research application and commercial potential.  The third objective is to use the best available techniques to assess the development of visual functioning and information processing in  broader populations of infants and children such as those with iron deficiency, high refractive error or  with neurological dysfunction.  Specifically, we want to field-test and in particular, evaluate the practical utility of the new tests that are designed in our laboratory. Although each experiment we conduct is designed to address a specific question pertinent to one of the long-term objectives, an underlying goal is to conduct research that addresses questions of basic science and of practical application. Collectively, the results of this work will interest  a wide variety of researchers, for instance, those who wish to understand the origins of the complex mechanisms that mediate vision and visual information processing; those would wish to identify aspects of the natural environment that capture infants' attention and potentially facilitate learning; those  who wish  to identify the behavioral correlates of early (and likely immature) anatomical and physiological development; and those of wish to generate new tools for measuring early sensory functioning.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Psychology: Brain, Behaviour & Cognitive Sciences",3,"RGPGP ","Discovery Grants Program - Group","Newfoundland and Labrador",Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador

"It is now believed that only 4% of the Universe exists in ordinary visible (baryonic) form, with another 23% in the form of non-radiating dark matter.  The remainder permeates the Universe in the form of a dark energy.  While the latter is a relatively new, speculative, concept, the gravitational presence of dark matter has been known for many decades.  Dark matter is an integral part of any model of galaxy formation and evolution; still, we have yet to accurately map the distribution of visible and dark matter in any galaxy. This proposal is concerned with the measurement of visible and dark matter, and their interplay, as well as the distribution of stellar populations in galaxies.  We are pursuing an ambitious program to measure the universal galaxy mass function as well as the scaling relations and stellar populations of galaxies using our multi-band imaging and spectroscopic data collected for Virgo cluster galaxies.  The importance of the Virgo cluster in modern astrophysics can scarcely be overestimated as it is the dominant mass concentration and the largest collection of galaxies in the local Universe. If we are to understand the nature of galaxies, including their structural properties, mass/luminosity distribution, and dark matter content, the obvious route forward is through a high-sensitivity, multi-wavelength study of this testbed cluster and its constituent galaxies. Well-resolved optical and infrared images of the nearby Andromeda galaxy and integrated spectra of Milky Way globular clusters will also be used to calibrate stellar population models.  Most of the data to achieve the goals of this proposal are either in place or guaranteed through approved legacy surveys (such as the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey). We also use numerical simulations to model galaxy density profiles and refine galaxy mass estimators. Over the next five years, I plan to use this grant to supervise a minimum of five undergraduate students, seven master students, and two doctoral students.  The graduate students in my group develop skills in observational, computational and theoretical astrophysics, as well as in research and teaching methods and public outreach.

"Many brain functions, if not all, require an intense collaboration between different areas. The interactions between cortical regions and with subcortical regions such as the cerebellum and basal ganglia are considered essential for proper performance in sensory, motor, and cognitive tasks. It is the capacity and the importance of these interactions that will be studied in this research programme, using the latest methods of measurement and analysis in network activity in the brain. The interactions between the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex are at the source of our controlled, calibrated actions. The electrical activity recorded with multiple single electrodes, such as action potentials and local field potentials, will be compared for the awake attentive rat and during sensorimotor tasks. A principal objective will be to evaluate if neuronal activity is structured by local influences such as oscillations, and if those promote communication across different areas such as the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, and the cerebral cortex. These patterns of interrelations will be evaluated in and out of tasks, and also with regard to the stability of the circuits during learning of sensorimotor tasks.

"The goals of this project are to a) better understand the sources of igneous rocks emplaced during the last 40 million years in the western United States, and b) investigate igneous activity associated with breakup of an old supercontinent in the southern Northwest Territories of Canada.  The past 40 million years has been a time of intense volcanic activity in the southwestern United States, particularly Nevada, accompanied by stretching and faulting of the crust.  Volcanism swept methodically from northeast to southwest across Nevada, presumably a result of the subduction of the Farallon Plate beneath North America.  We understand very little of how volcanism was linked to the subducting plate or crustal stretching, what the sources for the volcanic rocks were, and to what degree this igneous activity was responsible for contemporaneous gold mineralization in Nevada.  We seek to identify the sources of magmas, either in the mantle or in the crust (or both), and better describe the timing of the sweep of volcanism across northern and western Nevada.  In the Northwest Territories, an igneous intrusive complex was emplaced along the East Arm of Great Slave Lake around 2 billion years ago, carrying with it rocks rich in Nb, Ta, and rare earth elements, all important to industry.  The intrusions mark a new period in the history of the region, where, after a long period of geological quiescence, an old continental landmass was split into fragments that allowed these intrusions to rise to the surface.  Understanding the geochemistry and origin of the intrusions and the relationships between them will improve models for the origin of the economically important rare earth minerals and add to the exploration effort for more mineralization in the area.

"    )	The goal of this research program is to study evolutionary questions related to mobile group II introns. In a first initiative we are studying the dissemination of group II introns by conjugation and transduction between bacterial species. The transfer of these mobile elements between cells is called group II intron lateral or horizontal transfer. We are also studying the evolutionary relationships between group II introns, nuclear introns and the five small nuclear RNAs that are part of the splicing machinery of eukaryotes, the spliceosome.

    )	Our model system is the Ll.LtrB group II intron from Lactococcus lactis. L. lactis is an industrially important low G+C Gram-positive bacterium mainly used in the dairy industry for the production of cheese and yogurt. Ll.LtrB was found associated with different conjugative elements in L. lactis: the pRS01 and pAH90 plasmids and the chromosomal sex factor. We are thus studying if the transfer by conjugation of the L. lactis sex factor between bacterial cells can support the spread of the Ll.LtrB intron it conveys. We will also study if the Ll.LtrB intron can be disseminated in the bacterial kingdom by various bacteriophages (transduction). Following transfer of the intron-carrying elements from L. lactis to different bacterial species (conjugation or transduction), we will study the reinsertion of the Ll.LtrB group II intron in its new cell environment. Reinsertion of the Ll.LtrB intron into homologous and non-homologous sites will be studied. In a second effort, we are studying the capacity of group II introns to be fragmented and still splice in trans. This will allow us to address the origin of nuclear introns and their splicing machinery.

    )	These studies will shed light on the importance of horizontal transfer in the evolution and phylogenetic distribution of group II introns and to address the evolutionary theories claiming that group II introns are the ancestors of both the nuclear introns of eukaryotes and the five small nuclear RNAs that are part of the spliceosome.

"The repertoire of proteins that make up a proteome can be two to three orders of magnitude higher than the number of genes in its genome. This paradox, which is largely due to the myriad of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) deposited on protein backbones and/or side chains, expands the complexity of the cellular machinery and fine-tune biological pathways by altering the intrinsic biochemical properties of the modified proteins. Such modifications include, but are not restricted to, phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitinylation and sumoylation. The biological consequences of the signal will vary depending on the covalent alteration, the underlying chemistry and the type of residue that will be modified. Despite great progress in the development of proteomic and genomic tools, the biochemical and functional roles of enzymes that attach acetyl, methyl or phosphate groups have remained elusive. My laboratory employs X-ray crystallography and steady-steady-state kinetics to characterize covalent modifying enzymes. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the fundamental basis underlying the recognition and modification of a family of proteins that are central to DNA scaffolding, namely the histone proteins. Histone covalent modifications are critical for controlling DNA compaction and thereby a flurry of cellular processes. Being central to all eukaryotic organisms, determination of the mechanistic details eliciting histone modifications will provide a working model to uncover biological pathways controlled by each covalent modification. In this proposal, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which two histone methyltransferases selectively recognize unique residues on one histone tail and determine the consensus motifs recognized by these proteins. In a whole, the information retrieved by our research program will 1) provide the overall 3D-shape of histone modifying enzymes, 2) elucidate the atomic details of the driving forces central for the activity of post-transcriptional modifying enzymes and 3) determine the key binding interfaces of an enzyme conferring specificity for a given protein substrate.

"We request a narrow linewidth Diode-Pumped Solid State (DPSS) laser operating at 532 nm that will be used to obtain resonance Raman (rRaman) spectra of heme proteins (as described in current M. Couture Discovery Grant) and Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectra (SERS) of nanomaterial synthesized in order to build a flow-cell that will be used as a model of the vascular system (as described in B. Mutus Discovery Grant). M. Couture has a strong scientific program aimed at the detailed characterization of the catalytic mechanism of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), which are the enzymes that synthesize the signalling molecule nitric oxide. For this, her laboratory is equiped with a high resolution Raman system that is used to get rRaman spectra of NOSs and other heme proteins. The current set-up uses a laser emitting in the blue-region of the absorption spectrum to get rRaman spectra of stable samples as well as those of short-lived kinetic intermediates using a custom-build continuous flow mixer. The requested green DPSS laser would allow Q-band (green) excitation of the heme active site to specifically enhance non-totally symmetric modes of the heme. This would complement our current studies with blue-excitation and be extremely important to assign the modes of the heme macrocycle and of the heme substituents. Once assigned, specific heme modes could reveal how the electron density on the cysteine sulfur of NOSs is shared with the heme, how it responds to substrate and cofactor binding and how this relates to the catalytic process in NOSs. 



The requested green DPSS laser would also be used to initiate a collaboration with the B. Mutus group that has developed a strong and innovative program aimed at creating a flow-cell suitable for the study of signaling in vascular cells. The nanomaterial synthesized to build this flow-cell  would be characterized by SERS to determine the spatial arrangement of the linker chains on the gold nanoparticles in order to improve the synthesis steps in a controlled manner.

"Nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) synthesize the signaling and oxidative stress molecule nitric oxide (NO). The long-term objectives of this research program are to determine the structural, functional and dynamic properties of the active site of NOSs to understand the catalytic cycle and mechanisms of regulation of the enzymatic activity at the molecular level. The NO synthesized by NOSs is used as a signaling molecule in the vascular and neural systems. It is also a toxic molecule used by the immune system in host defenses against pathogens and cancer cells. The involvement of NO in many aspects of human physiology and diseases, including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, means that isoform-specific inhibitors are needed to regulate neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). We expect that gaining a thorough understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of NOSs, including providing a detailed picture of heme-ligand substrate interactions and identifying key kinetic intermediates, will improve our comprehension of the chemistry of NOSs and, in the long term, will help in the development of potent, isoform-specific inhibitors of human NOSs. The specific objectives of this proposal thus are: A-Characterize by resonance Raman spectroscopy the first oxygenated intermediate formed during the catalytic cycle of NOSs using non-natural substrates and characterize the oxygenated complex of active site mutants. These studies will help determine the importance in the catalytic cycle of polar and steric interactions between substrates and the heme-bound dioxygen at the active site and will also help decipher the role played by the proximal cysteine ligated to the heme. B- Characterize the oxygenated form of NOS mutants to determine the involvement of protein dynamics in the catalytic cycle. C-Characterize catalytic intermediates formed by the reaction with peroxide. The latter two studies aim to get a better understanding of the mechanisms of NOS synthesis by NOSs. D-Characterize the interactions between heme-bound ligands (O2, NO and CO) and NOS inhibitors with all three mammalian NOSs to decipher the structural basis for inhibitor binding and isoform specificity. Together, these studies will provide an understanding at the molecular level of the mechanism of NO synthesis, identify important factors modulating the enzymatic activity and identify structural determinants for isoform-specificity of NOSs.

"Cell proteins serve a vast number of essential functions. Examples of protein functions include enzymes, membrane transporters and channels, intracellular ligands and hormone receptors. Living organisms produce proteins from genetic codes recorded in genes stored as DNA, which are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translated into proteins. The presence of specific mRNA in cells indicates a cellular or organismal need for the proteins for which they encode. Ecotoxicogenomics is the study of changes in gene expression in response to contaminant exposure in wild organisms. This study will examine changes in gene expression patterns in wild yellow perch exposed to metal mixtures in the field. To this end, we will create a cDNA microarray, consisting of a glass slide on which over 1000 gene sequences will be spotted, and which will allow the simultaneous measurement of the level of expression of all genes present on the slide. Yellow perch is the most common species of wild fish around major metal mining and smelting areas in Canada and therefore the most relevant fish for metals ecotoxicogenomics. Yellow perch will be collected from Sudbury ON and Rouyn-Noranda QC, along metal contamination gradients. In Rouyn-Noranda, fish from a clean lake will also be caged in a contaminated lake and vice-versa. Finally, yellow perch will also be exposed in the laboratory to single metals and to natural stressors (temperature, hypoxia, food ration variations) in order to link basic physiological and behavioural responses to gene expression profiles. Combined, these studies will allow us to identify metal-specific gene expression signatures. The microarray will be tested with the objective to develop a tool for Environmental Effects Monitoring of metals in contaminated aquatic environments. The results of this study will improve our capacity to monitor and mitigate the environmental impacts of the metals industry in Canada.","Effet des activit�s �conomiques sur l'environnement (y compris agriculture)",Environnement,"RPP Internal Decision Cttee",1,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"Scaling of integrated circuit process technologies has enabled orders-of-magnitude increases in the processing capabilities of microprocessors, however their input/output (I/O) signalling bandwidths have increased at a slower rate. Hence, computational and signal processing systems are not reaching their full potential, because data communication cannot keep up with data processing, and because data communication dissipates an increasingly large fraction of a system's total power dissipation. To address this, we are conducting research in the areas of chip-to-chip and on-chip data communication.



To minimize cost, communication circuits (which are usually analog in nature) are often forced to reside and operate on predominantly digital integrated circuits. This imposes additional challenges on the design of the former, namely, a low supply voltage; an electrically noisy power supply and interconnection environment; a process technology whose transistors are optimized for digital logic performance; transistor models whose parameters may be accurate for logic simulation but inaccurate for analog circuit simulation; transistors whose model parameters are estimates, rather than based on hardware measurements, until after a preliminary design must be completed; and transistors whose electrical performance may vary significantly from wafer to wafer, and from device to device.



The goal of this research is to propose and validate mixed-signal integrated circuit/system design strategies that improve the performance and manufacturability of data communication circuits.

"To create images computer graphics solves simulations of light and matter subject to physical laws that are most often real, but may be imaginary. These simulations are inexact, because the goal is a picture, not a model of reality. Thus, the criterion for success is not exact correspondence with reality, but the response of the viewer. This response is both situation-dependent and subjective. Applied perception, my research area, measures human response to images, visual, auditory or haptic, to provide an objective basis for situation-dependent quality criteria for computer-generated imagery.

In this project I am concentrating on unattended perception, how a viewer receives and uses information without needing to focus attention on it. Visual input that maintains posture or adjusts gait is an example. The goal is to measure unattended information, which is tricky, so as to assess the factors that make it effective. The result will be rules of thumb that programmers can use when developing rendering algorithms for parts of a scene that are expected not to be attended. It is important that such parts be rendered well-enough but not so well that they consume too many resources.

My approach to unattended perception is empirical. I approach it through calm technology, using dual task methods to measure which aspects of computer-generated images are perceived when attention is saturated with another task.

The other aspect of this project concerns approximate methods for lighting and rendering. I have identified a large class of techniques as being examples of a general underlying algorithmic strategy, which simplifies the simulation by separating it into parts. I regard this class of algorithms, from which come most approximation algorithms used for unattended parts of a scene, as ripe for analysis and formalization. It is also the logical complement to my interest in unattended perception.","Technologie de l'information, des ordinateurs et des r�seaux de communications","Avancement des connaissances","Computing and Information Sciences - B",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario
"Performance measurement is the cornerstone of accountability and it has been used in industry for several decades to improve business systems and processes.  Industry's key performance measures are the balance sheet and stock value. The public sector also has a balance sheet, but stock value does not exist instead performance can be measured as a policy or expenditure outcomes.   

With the move to asset management including the adoption of business practices, performance measurement is a new approach for public agencies who have traditionally reported inputs and outputs, but not outcomes.  Technical performance measures abound but the importance of developing outcome based performance measures is indicated by the recent work of the National Round Table for Sustainable Infrastructure (NRTSI) which is developing a five year plan to define the state, condition and management of core public infrastructure.  Preliminary work in the NRTSI indicates a knowledge 'deficit' when it comes to performance measurement.  

This research focuses on two performance measures used in transportation agencies that encompass the technical domain of asset measurement (International Roughness Index, AADT and collisions) as well as operational performance measurement (winter mobility as defined by speed and time to recover) it is expected that an improved understanding of the issues and challenges in linking technical performance measures to the users/stakeholders will be the research outcome.  In particular, providing a template that can be used to develop more accessible and user friendly language that are still founded on technical excellence will provide guidance to agencies struggling to develop meaningful, robust, relevant and sustainable performance measures.

"I develop mark-recapture models to estimate population parameters such as survival and abundance of animal populations.  To do so, I develop models, fit and test models and develop computer programs motivated by real-world applications from biological settings.  This research tackles pressing applied problems faced by fisheries, wildlife managers, conservation biologists, and epidemiologists.



My first priority is to develop methods to deal with tag loss in mark-recapture experiments.  This will include the study of dependent tag loss where the behaviour of the individual contributes to tag loss.  Even though tag loss is known to cause bias in estimates and their standard errors, it is often ignored for lack of appropriate methods.



Secondly I will explore how both observable and unobservable explanatory variables in models can be used to deal with differences in survival and capture rates (heterogeneity) which can also cause bias in estimates.  Heterogeneity has been a long-standing issue in mark-recpature experiments and methods to deal with it should be investigated.



Finally, I will make use of the Bayesian paradigm to develop methodology that would otherwise be cumbersome using classical statistics.  Mark-recapture models are plagued by large numbers of parameters and missing data. The Bayesian framework is more suited to handle these sorts of complex, hierarchical analyses which I will exploit for this setting.

"All living creatures critically depend on being able to sense their environment and mount the appropriate responses in order to survive.  As a consequence, all cells have intricate systems to do this.  Such systems include proteins that sense environmental change and then signal this change to the other proteins that they interact with.  Through such networks of protein interactions, the cell can orchestrate complex responses that are required to survive diverse environmental stresses such as changes in temperature, pH, or salt concentration or even exposure to toxins, pollutants, and chemical pesticides.  Given the central importance of these signaling networks for adapting to environmental stress, the proteins involved are often highly conserved throughout evolution.  This research program uses the most experimentally tractable organisms that are closely related to humans to study the mechanisms by which changes in the network of protein interactions impact on cellular signaling, survival during stress, and, ultimately, adaptation to new environments.  We will use fungal model systems to evolve new connections in protein interaction networks, will exploit the genetic variation in diverse fungal species to determine how interaction networks have been reconfigured by evolution in nature, and will dissect the specific changes within a species underpinning adaptation to divergent environments on a global scale.  This research uses state-of-the-art molecular tools to understand the wiring of a cell and how this can influence the course of evolution.  The outcomes of this work will allow molecular geneticists to understand new aspects of cellular signaling and will also provide new insights for evolutionary biologists as to how evolution happens at the molecular level.  Beyond benefiting multiple scientific disciplines, this research will establish strategies to block the evolution of resistance to pesticides crucial for agricultural productivity as well as strategies to evolve microbes with enhanced capacity to tolerate stress and remediate contaminated environments, thereby improving the lives of Canadians.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"Potassium channels are proteins found in the membrane of the cell and which permit potassium ions to enter or exit the cell as required. They are found thoughout the body, where they perform a wide range of biological functions. In epithelial cells, which line body cavities and structures providing support and protection, potassium channels are responsible for a number of important processes, including the control of fluid and electrolyte absorption and secretion, regulating cell volume, and controlling cell proliferation. Work from my laboratory is concerned with improving our understanding of potassium channels in the epithelial cells which line our lungs. The aims of this proposal are to investigate the regulation and function of two different types of potassium channels- one regulated by calcium (the Ca-activated potassium channel termed hIK), and also voltage-gated potassium channels in the Kv4 and KCNQ families. Using a number of different cell lines derived from human airway epithelial cells, we will investigate how these channels are regulated and, in the case of the Kv4 channels, where they are expressed and what their biological roles might be. To do this, we will use a number of different experimental techniques to investigate factors which might increase their expression at the gene and protein level and to compliment these studies with methods that provide direct measurements of the activity of the channels. In the long term, the goals of this research are to increase our understanding of how these important ion channels work to regulate fundamental biological processes in airway epithelia.

"Although most often associated with the carbon cycle, terrestrial vegetation can also have a profound influence on the Earth's hydrological and surface energy budgets. Plants release water into the atmosphere via transpiration, and as a result can influence the partitioning of surface energy into sensible and latent heat. Latent heat is a form of potential energy that results in the use of energy for vaporization of water, wherein the latent energy can be moved to distant areas and released upon condensation. Production of latent energy therefore is a means by which atmospheric heat and moisture is transported to cooler places across the globe. Recent research in my lab indicates that if vegetation in northern latitudes, like in the Canadian boreal forest and tundra, were to be more productive (say as a result of increasing atmospheric CO2), then the extra production of latent heat that they would produce could represent a potential positive feedback on Arctic warming. This proposal is aimed at getting a better understanding of how vegetation can influence atmospheric transport of moisture and heat. This research is made all the more critical because satellite research has already shown that northern latitudes are much greener now than they were over a decade ago. If this greening also results in an increase in latent heat production, then we should be prepared for an even greater magnitude of warming. It is unwise of us to overlook positive (warming) feedbacks because they can lead to ""climate surprises"" and threshold-induced rapid rates of climate change.

"In many interactions with computers, users accomplish tasks by manipulating visual representations of objects. Having noted that logic programming provides a simple but powerful mechanism for manipulating complex symbolic structures (unification), we are investigating ways to apply variants of this mechanism to structures with concrete visual representations. Accordingly, we are applying logic programming in two domains where manipulation of visual structures is of key importance: designing complex parametrised structured objects, and spreadsheet programming and design.

We have proposed a logic-based visual language for structured design (LSD), which integrates concrete representations of design components with operations that specify how components are assembled, and have shown how the definition of ""design space"", on which LSD depends, naturally captures the notion of the behaviour of complex components; how design synthesis and assembly of structured objects can be integrated; and how domain-specific operations on components might be animated. Our long term goal is to develop a formal basis for visual design languages, sufficiently general to apply to a wide range of industrial design domains. This has the potential to make an important contribution to industrial design.

Spreadsheets, in their current form, have limited programming facilities, minimal abstraction facilities, and no sound software engineering tools or methodology. As a result, despite the fact that they are used for critical applications, they are among the most error-prone of programming tools. We have shown that by defining a form of unification that applies to arrays, logic programming can be added to spreadsheets to provide facilities for programming abstractions in the sheet interface, and specifying spreadsheet structure. Our goal is a spreadsheet model which supports the ""formula-in-cell"" programming familiar to spreadsheet users, while providing tools to help users build robust and reliable spreadsheet applications.

"Climate change, habitat alteration, and over-exploitation are the main processes that threaten marine populations world-wide, including those in Canada.  Inshore rockfish populations (e.g., Sebastes caurinus, S. maliger) in deep fjord marine ecosystems around the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia (B.C.) may be particularly at-risk because these threats have already been documented and will likely increase in the future. Furthermore, rockfish have life-history and ecological characteristics that are common among extinct, or threatened, marine species. For example, rockfish are long-lived (45-76 yr), have relatively low birthrates, high age-at-maturity (12-18 yr), and low mobility following settlement to deep rocky reefs. It is therefore not surprising that some rockfish populations in the U.S.A. are considered ""at risk of extinction"".  My research combines empirical and modeling approaches to improve predictions of the population consequences of environmental change. This proposal describes two specific field research programs that support my long-term research goals. First, I propose to examine local-scale relationships among habitat complexity, population density, growth, and survival of inshore rockfish. These ""density-dependent"" processes are central to rockfish population sustainability as well as our ability to determine essential fish habitat. My second objective examines regional-scale connectivity, or the exchange of individuals among rockfish populations. Connectivity is determined by the spatial distribution of habitat patches, the dispersal ability of inshore rockfish larvae, and the local oceanographic features such as currents and food availability. These factors, among others, combine to determine the long-term response of inshore rockfish populations to climate change.  The inter-disciplinary research in this proposal offers an ideal opportunity for training highly qualified environmental biologists and future resource managers. My emphasis on empirical field research and quantitative analysis fosters graduate and undergraduate academic preparation, technical skill, leadership, and logistical planning and execution.

"There is growing interest in assessing and mitigating the impacts of fishing gear on the seafloor because these habitats play an important role in maintaining fish and shellfish production. Unfortunately, major gaps still exist in our knowledge of how deep-sea ecosystems respond to different types of fishing disturbances. Failure to address these gaps may leave many Canadian bottom-fisheries at risk of losing access to important export markets in the United States, Europe, and Asia as consumers and retailers in these markets increasingly demand eco-certified seafood products. Quantitative estimates of fishing gear impacts on seafloor habitat are an important component of eco-certification assessments; however, there are no existing procedures or methods for performing these assessments, especially on Canada's west coast. We propose to develop an exposure-response approach to assessing the potential impacts of bottom-fishing gear on seafloor habitat. We will develop exposure-response models by combining spatial mapping of bottom-fishing effort intensity and habitat (the exposure) with submersible surveys of habitat-forming species density (the response). This approach provides a flexible and adaptive framework that builds the necessary information to support eco-certification of British Columbia's bottom-fisheries. In addition, a better understanding of how bottom habitat responds to fishing disturbances will help the fishing industry design operational changes that reduce or eliminate these impacts. Thus, Canada and the fishing industry will benefit from healthier ecosystems and more sustainable fisheries.","P�che commerciale","Ressources naturelles (aspects �conomiques)","Strategic Projects Selection Panel - Fishery Industry","1 & 2 & 3","STPGP ","Strategic Projects - Group","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Solution precursor plasma spraying (SPPS) is a process capable of depositing coatings of almost any composition by injecting solutions of precursor salts corresponding to the desired coating composition into a DC-arc plasma. The rapid formation of the solid from the solution results in extremely fine crystallite sizes, typically on the order of 20-30 nm. Coating structures can range from extremely high porosities to nearly completely dense. However, a number of complex phenomena are involved and significant challenges exist in understanding and controlling the process in order to be able to reliably deposit coatings of the desired structure, composition, and properties.



The proposed research programme will extend and expand our recent work in SPPS. There are two major objectives. One is to further develop and demonstrate the potential of this process to produce unique, high performance deposits for specific applications. Of particular interest is the electrochemical performance of these coatings as electrodes in SOFCs, as gas sensors, and in the photocatalytic treatment of impurities in the air and water. A limited number of the most promising short-term applications will be identified and pursued in collaboration with researchers or companies having specific expertise in the area of application. The second major objective is to develop a better understanding of the phenomena involved in the process through numerical modelling of the evaporation, break-up and collision of droplets in the plasma, the precipitation of product phases in the droplets, the heating, melting, and impact of the particles on the substrate. This objective will be pursued in collaboration with colleagues and former students from the Centre for Advanced Coating Technologies.

"A major goal of our research program is to obtain quantitative information about the effect of zeolite structure and composition on the behaviour of organic reactive intermediates using fast reaction techniques.  In these studies, the short-lived reactive intermediates are generally utilized as probe molecules specially designed to give information about the nature of the internal cavities of zeolites.  Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate materials made up of an open framework structure that gives rise to a variety of different cavities and channels. The overall objective is to determine how simple modifications to the zeolite structure and composition, such as alkali-metal cation exchange or the incorporation of co-reactants affect the dynamics of a variety of reactions involving short-lived species.  One current focus is to study the dynamics of bimolecular reactions within zeolites using both carbenes and carbocations as probe reactive intermediates.  The information from these studies will help to describe the diffusion of molecules within these solid systems.  We are also obtaining results that will allow us to develop theories to explain why reactions in zeolites tend to show reduced substituent effects compared to the same reactions in solution.   In addition, we are also exploring the potential utility of zeolites as hosts for two-photon absorption, a technique with great potential for a wide range of applications, including data storage and photodynamic therapies.  Finally, we are taking advantage of our past experience studying the ionization of beta-substituted radicals in order to develop a new class of phototriggers that could be of use in studies of biological phenomena.  State-of-the-art instruments are used in this research, including nanosecond and femtosecond lasers.  Researchers become highly proficient in a wide range of experimental techniques including laser flash photolysis,  complex data analysis, synthetic organic chemistry,  and characterization techniques such as NMR, GC/MS, fluorescence and UV-Vis spectroscopy.  The proposed research will train researchers to understand the complexity of modern experimental research using state-of-the-art equipment and will prepare those researchers for a strong scientific career.

"    )	Enzymes are molecules that allow reactions to occur at the appropriate rate in a cell under physiological conditions. The health of a cell is totally dependent upon such reactions. However, since the requirements of a cell change with differing conditions, so must the rates of many of the reactions sustaining the cell. Since it is enzymes that control these rates, it is essential for a cell to be able to regulate these enzymes to ensure that all of a cell's requirements are being properly met.

    )	Since molecules are so small, chemical studies have classically involved measurements made on a very large number of seemingly identical molecules. All the data obtained reflects average values for the characteristics being measured. If differences between individual molecules existed, they would not be detected due to the very large scale averaging. 

    )	Over the past years, scientists have developed methods to measure the characteristics of individual molecules, including enzymes. With enzymes an interesting finding was made: Individual molecules of a given enzyme do not have identical properties. This means that in order to regulate its chemistry, a cell must alter the distribution of characteristics of an enzyme population. The means by which this is achieved is not understood.

    )	In my research we use the enzyme beta-galactosidase as a model to study the structural differences which underlie enzyme microheterogeneity and how a cell can alter the distribution of properties of a population of individual enzyme molecules in order to regulate its chemistry. This is done with the use of single enzyme molecule measurements. The effect of a given treatment on the distribution properties of the composite individual molecules of an enzyme population is measured. This is performed to provide insight into the structural differences between the individual molecules and to determine how the cell can alter the distribution of properties to effect a desired change in the overall population characteristics. This will increase our overall understanding of how cell chemistry is controlled and how this relates to the states of both health and disease.    )	","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Manitoba,Manitoba

"How is a transmitted message preserved from errors due to noise?  One way is to introduce 

redundancy; a simple kind of redundancy is obtained by sending multiple copies.  A more efficient approach uses Error Correcting Codes, the most important of which involve Hadamard matrices -- square array's of 1's and -1's whose rows form the ``words'' of the code.  The rows of a Hadamard matrix must be``orthogonal'', which means, roughly, that they are as different as possible.  



This project studies many questions about Hadamard matrices and related objects lumped together as ""orthogonal matrices"".  Other applications occur in optics, cryptography, spectroscopy, information storage devices (such as CD's), and range-finding equipment such as GPS and radar. Orthogonal matrices are also of great theoretical interest -- first, because they bridge a gap between major fields of mathematics; and, second, because answers to simple questions about them are elusive.   The best known of these questions, now considered  one of the great unsolved mathematical problems, was posed by J. Hadamard in 1893:  What are the possible sizes of Hadamard matrices?  Another one, posed by Ryser in about 1960:  Can a Hadamard matrix be obtained from a single row by rotating its entries to the right into all possible positions?  



That such practical considerations coincide with compelling theoretical questions marking crucial gaps in our understanding explains the broad interest in orthogonal matrices.  Some consider these problems too intractible to attempt, but our innovative approach emphasizing the deeper structure of these matrices is yielding promising new insights. The algebraical tools  we have introduced have already been used to make significant progress on questions like the Hadamard matrix problem.

"The proposed research program consists of a series of studies to elucidate the processes of encoding and retrieval in human memory.   The experiments are in two main areas; first, studies of basic encoding and retrieval mechanisms at the cognitive level, and second, studies of adult age-related changes in these mechanisms and processes.  Additionally, I will continue to collaborate with colleagues conducting neuroimaging studies to specify the neural correlates of attention, memory and learning.  Four main theoretical points guide the present program.  First, rather than think of memory as divided into separate systems, I postulate degrees of specificity running from abstract (""semantic"") to highly specific (""episodic"") representations; I plan to gather more evidence on this point.  Second, I will explore the possibility that older adults have particular difficulty with specific information (e.g., names, episodic detail).  Third, I will run studies to explore the notion of 'consolidation.' Fourth, I will evaluate the idea that 'working memory' is more accurately described as a set of domain-specific processes related to a person's set of expert knowledge schemas.  The associated experimental work will manipulate conditions at encoding and retrieval; some studies will mimic aging by using divided attention.  The experiments on working memory will examine bridge-playing experts.

"Constructing routes for distribution purposes is a key activity in the logistic processes of many companies. The overall objective of this project is to develop new decision support tools (models, algorithms, and software) to build routes in the complex environment faced by companies in their regular operations. The vehicle routing problems that will be tackled will account for a much broader range of operational characteristics and objectives than the classical variants usually considered in the literature: complex costing formulas for routes, multiple depots, multiple fleets of restricted sizes, loading restrictions, multiple/periodic customer service, variable vehicle speed according to load or activity, etc. Special emphasis will be put on addressing the impact of uncertainty in problem data and on the need for providing ""robust"" solutions.

The project will focus on the development and evaluation of heuristic algorithms capable of handling the large instances encountered in real applications. These heuristics will be based on multi-thread cooperative search strategies, which have proved very successful in similar contexts.

Two industrial partners, Alimentation Couche-Tard and La Federation des producteurs de lait du Quebec, will provide detailed contextual information and data on the planning and operating environment in which routes are to be determined and will use the results of research. The participation of Omega Optimisation, a company specialized in the development of operations research software for industrial applications, will ensure that the tools developed are industrial strength and thus facilitate technological transfer.

The project will yield new vehicle routing models and new solution algorithms. It should also lead to new insights on the performance of multi-thread cooperative methods. The software that will be produced should allow industrial partners to derive more effective distribution routes and thus to significantly cut on their logistical costs. In the long run, other benefits for Canada should include reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and an improved competitivity for Canadian businesses.

"The common threads of this research proposal are represented by 1) computational methods designed for complex data models with particular emphasis on Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, 2) model selection procedures and 3) topics in Statistical Genetics. 



Some of my previous work has showed that algorithms developed at the intersection of randomized quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) could combine the strengths of the two approaches and I believe that further improvement can be made by constructing new algorithms at the interface between RQMC and MCMC. I also develop Monte Carlo techniques for estimation in models with missing data where analytical calculations are intractable.



My interest in model selection was triggered by the work I have done in cellular automata and competing risks. Recent work looks at the performance of the Deviance Information Criterion and its relation to the model focus. 



The problem of multiple hypothesis testing has become one of high priority in genomic studies. My work has focused on the control of type II error rate as well as the development of alternative false discovery control methods that utilize the available auxiliary information. I intend to continue the work on statistical and computational problems in genetic studies, especially in the area of multiple hypothesis testing in multi-stage

experiments.

"Chronic pain is no longer considered solely a symptom, but for complex and poorly understood reasons, is often self perpetuating and becomes like a disease unto itself. Among many therapeutic approaches to pain management, analgesic drug therapy continues to play a central role. Pure opioid agonists such as morphine remain the gold standard in pain pharmacotherapy, however toxicity of morphine therapy has limited its long term applicability. Better ways to understand how to improve tolerability of opioids and to predict which combinations of analgesics to offer, are urgently needed. Significantly, although morphine targets the same opioid receptor (mu opioid receptor, MOR) as endogenous opioids, it does not trigger the same mechanism for regeneration of free receptor at the cell's surface. It has been convincingly established that upon stimulation by morphine, MORs do not undergo the usual internalization, which is the first step in receptor regeneration. A drug cocktail induced correlation between the internalization rate of MOR and the dynamics of the NMD A receptor, DOR and/or beta-arrestin will provide an accurate assay for the potency of the cocktail. To observe these coupled dynamics, we will make real time molecular movies of the trafficking of ORs in response to various combinations of stimuli to OR and to the NMDA receptors. This will be accomplished using quantum dot labels and video-rate microscopy.

"Increasingly, semi-conductor nanocrystals (aka quantum dots, QDs) are being used in biophysical research. The applications are mostly to enhance imaging analyses of tissues and in biological assays of ligand binding and protein or genetic material dynamics. The dots' narrow luminescence spectra and almost infinite photostability suggest that they are the ultimate fluorescent label. However, crucial aspects of the photophysical and photodynamic behavior of quantum dots remain poorly understood. Once a deeper understanding of this behavior is gained, it will be possible to exploit more thoroughly the application of quantum dots in nanodevices for biophysical research, a research paradigm which is in its infancy. 



Long term goals: 1. Understand the fundamental photophysical nature of QDs and assemblies thereof; 2. Develop hybrid QD nano-assemblies for biological, telecom and light harvesting applications; 3. Use nanotechnology to understand small molecule effects on lipid bilayers.

"The primary astronomical objectives are to use gravitational lenses to study the distribution of dark matter around galaxies and groups of galaxies, and the amplification and magnification provided by these lenses to study the formation and evolution of high redshift galaxies. The primary instrumentation objective is to better understand the performance and limitations of current 8m class instruments in order to design and construct the next generation of instruments for ELTs(Extra Large Telescopes). More specifically, funding is requested to provide partial support (to complement NRC support) for two students per year who will produce accurate models of the lenses found in the CFHT Legacy Survey data and who will utilize Gemini laser guide star adaptive optics integral field spectroscopic data to study details of high redshift galaxies that are lensed by foreground galaxies or groups of galaxies. Lenses that are now being discovered with the CFHTLS are providing a new, unique opportunity to study the high redshift universe, as is the advent of laser guide star adaptive optics.

"A revolution is currently occurring in the miniaturization of fluid mechanical devices. Just as shrinking the scale of computers has led to complete changes in lifestyles, working practices and global economies within a human generation, similar developments are occurring in the realm of small scale devices that involve the flow of one or more fluids.  Many of these developments are driven by medical, biochemical, bioanalytical, nanoliter scale chemical reaction engineering, and microfluidic ""lab-on-a-chip""devices. Still others find their motivation in the development of advanced materials, such as superhydrophobic and patterned surfaces with unique wetting, electrical and material properties, self-assembled materials that acquire their structure as a result of non-hydrodynamic forces, and so-called 'complex fluids': colloids, polymer solutions, and particulate suspension, that involve what is often counter-intuitive fluid mechanical behavior.   These devices and applications are implemented at very small length scales and require a level of accurate manipulation and control of fluids that is unusual in larger scale applications.



This research project is on the accurate modeling of these phenomena, particularly those associated with evaporation and nanoparticles. Associated with the task of creating patterns - stripes of conducting material, say, for semi-conductor applications and miniaturization, is that of controlling or preventing fluid mechanical instabilities than may disrupt or destroy the pattern. The physical and theoretical understanding of the detailed mechanisms leading to instability, and accurate predictive numerical simulation of these instabilities, are the main aim of this research.

"The unsteady, aeroelastic behaviour of wind turbines and their cost sensitivity poses unique design challenges not found elsewhere. Notwithstanding great strides made in designing increasingly large wind turbines, there remains large uncertainty in analysis predictions, particularly in the areas of aerodynamics and non-linear structural response. Adequate aerodynamic validation data is conspicuously lacking. The sheer size of utility-scale machines can create technical and social impediments. One alternative that is often espoused is to install small machines (1-10's kW) locally to end-use locations. Knowledge of the flow conditions and design of these smaller machines is relatively undeveloped. Advanced analysis tools are required to drive future design innovations, such as winglets and bend-twist coupled blades, across all scales. Better numerical optimization techniques, applied to the fully coupled multidisciplinary aeroelastic problem, are also needed. The proposed research program is aimed at addressing these areas, summarized as follows:

- Development of advanced wind turbine analysis tools, capable of handling novel concepts with better accuracy in design-relevant time frames, while maintaining consistency across a range of fidelity levels and modelling approaches

- Controlled scale-model testing, with full flow-field and rotor data acquisition, for code validation. Use of rapid-prototyping tools to generate numerous rotor models for testing, and as a concurrent activity in the design process of novel rotors

- Development of multidisciplinary optimization methods to effectively couple low and high order analysis tools, with inclusion of time-domain and controller effects

- Utilizing the results of the above outlined research, carry out the design, optimization and real-world testing of more cost-effective small wind turbines","G�nie","Avancement des connaissances","Mechanical Engineering - B",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"The goal of my research program is to understand the mechanisms by which membrane proteins maintain the right balance of calcium level essential for normal neuronal cell function. Cell membranes contain various well described transport proteins, which enable calcium to enter (or leave) the cell. I have recently isolated five novel members of the human subfamily of P5-type transporters, called ATP13A1 to ATP13A5, classified as calcium transporters. This is of special interest, since calcium plays a central role in neuronal physiology including neuronal maturation, differentiation, and cell death. The main objectives of the currently proposed research program are to understand the biological function of P5-type pumps, to provide experimental evidence that they are involved in calcium homeostasis, and to show that they have distinct functions from the major known calcium transporters. The emphasis will be on their biological role in the developing and mature nervous system. My lab integrates various modern molecular methodologies in the area of genetics, neuroscience and cell physiology to study biochemical properties of proteins. I will study the expression and mechanisms of regulation during normal brain development, and potential physiological changes associated with defects in their activity. This program of study will provide new insights into the nature of membrane ion translocation, and it will help to elucidate novel and distinctive mechanisms of calcium regulation.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"We have been studying a regulatory gene, Pitx3, that has been linked to eye malformations and cataracts in humans. Pitx3 presumably normally acts to coordinate the activities of other genes necessary to the formation of a lens and retina.  When mutated, the gene has similar effects in mice, however all of the mutant mice and human patients characterized to date likely retain partial gene function. Pitx3 plays a similar role in frogs, an organism that is routinely employed to study eye development and genetics. However we have noticed other anomalies in mutant frogs that suggest additional roles for Pitx3 in establishing a body plan for embryos:  Pitx3 plays a role in correctly orienting asymmetrical organs such as stomach, intestine, heart, gall bladder etc.  In addition, the gene appears to play a role in regulating the segmentation of precursors to the vertebrae.  We have employed a technique called microarray analysis to identify likely downstream targets (other genes) of Pitx3 activity.  We have isolated some of these genes, and we are currently trying to understand how Pitx3 coordinates their participation in the regulatory networks that construct eye, vertebrae, and asymmetrical visceral organs.  Characterizing the gene networks involved in segmentation and left/right asymmetry is important for helping us to understand how spinal, heart, and eye defects arise in humans.","Sant� publique (y compris recherche psychologique li�e � la m�decine)","Sant� publique, �ducation et services sociaux","Molec. & Develop.

"Geochronology is the science of determining absolute geological time using radioactive decay of unstable isotopes in Earth materials (rocks, minerals, ores). Geochronology requires integration of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics with the Geosciences to understand the processes that have shaped our planet over a 4.6 billion year history. The rhenium-osmium (187Re-187Os) radioactive isotope system is one of the last to be implemented in the Geosciences, due mainly to analytical difficulties. Although the Re-Os system is only applicable to selected crustal rocks and minerals, these happen to be the rock and mineral types for which the more commonly used radioactive dating system such as U-Pb, Ar-Ar and Rb-Sr cannot generally be used to provide age dates. The proposed research will focus on three projects in which accurate and precise crustal geochronology will provide a major scientific advancement of knowledge relating to regional and global-scale crustal processes. Research in Re-Os geochronology will applied to the evolution of the Proterozoic Earth by dating of organic-bearing shales from a variety of basins worldwide. The aims of the research are to: 1/ provide absolute age control for key Proterozoic strata associated with global glaciations and 2/ To provide precise age control for the biologically-critical Ediacaran System in Earth history (635-542 Ma) with which to evaluate and test models of cause-effect between changes in the Earth's surface conditions (glaciations) and biological evolution.  The second project will use common sulfide minerals like pyrite to constrain the timing of fluid flow events in sedimentary basins using the Re-Os method. Similarly, the generation and flow of hydrocarbons (oil) in sedimentary basins can be directly dated using Re-Os. Coupling both these methods to study aqueous and hydrocarbon fluid flow in the same basin will provide critical timing information with which to test the various models of the driving geological force(s) behind basinal fluid flow. Lastly, a study of the fundamental nature of Re and Os in oil will be undertaken to provide a sound basis for the implementation of the Re-Os isotope system in petroleum exploration.

"Forested landscapes provide ecological services that result in clean air and water.  Forest sustainability is essential for the survival of local human communities as well as the global biosphere.  Unfortunately, these landscapes are at risk due to an increasing demand for natural resources and altered land-uses, both at a time when climate change is creating greater uncertainties in their future.  In forests, the fundamental unit for science and management of water resources is the watershed.  In order to maintain the integrity of forested ecosystems it is essential that the focus of investigation for the physical, biological, and chemical sciences is directed at the watershed level.  A comprehensive understanding of these processes is required in order to predict the responses of watersheds to a changing climate (both gradual changes in climate and extreme events such as floods and droughts), coupled with natural and anthropogenic disturbances.  It is critical to achieve this understanding since watershed responses may be non-linear, meaning that they can reach ""tipping points"" in response to an environmental change that can lead to unexpected ecosystem responses.   My NSERC DG research program will:  (1) provide critical advancements of our current understanding of watershed processes, particularly as they relate to water and the dissolved and particulate substances carried by water and their role in shaping downstream microbial productivity and diversity; (2) document and project the changing rates of watershed processes over time (focusing on gradual change and extreme events); (3) explore the shifting dominance in watershed processes across space (from small catchments to regional drainage basins); and  (4) establish the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on water resources.  This research program will develop interdisciplinary and innovative approaches to the study of how watershed processes will respond to a global climate change.

"    )	Post-Quantum Cryptography is a keyword coined by Dan Bernstein to refer to (cryptography related) computational assumptions that are not known to be broken by a potential Quantum Computer. This field is currently gaining considerable momentum and several new improvements are making use of such computational assumptions continuously more appealing to users. The main three sources of such hypothesis are the fields of coding theory, real lattice problems and multivariate polynomial with low degrees. Because of the threat generated by the potential existence of a quantum computer, a lot of attention is now moving onto these alternative assumptions.



    )	Quantum Cryptography refers not only to the traditional applications such as Quantum Key Distribution due to Bennett and Brassard, but to any cryptographic task where quantum information is used in one way or another: either, to use quantum communication to solve classical cryptographic tasks (such as QKD), or more involved cryptographic situations where Quantum Data is actually at stake. It is a tradition around my research group to focus on alternate cryptographic tasks such as Bit Commitment and Oblivious Transfer. These two primitives are of highest importance for constructions of more general cryptographic tasks.



         The spirit of this research is to continue the study of cryptographic protocols in the context of quantum information processing. Very many new related questions will arise in the next five years and most of them will be of interest to my research group.

"In my research group we study the evolution of traits related to social behaviour, reproduction, and life history, in a variety of animals, including insects, mammals, and humans.  Our work on social behavior is designed to help uncover the circumstances under which animals cooperate with one another, rather than engaging in the forms of competition that usual prevail in nature.  These studies involve detailed analyses of the behaviour, ecology and evolution of specific sets of related species, and comparisons of these species with diverse others.  Our work on reproduction is focused on understanding why most animals engage in sexual reproduction (with two sexes, male and female), when theory from evolutionary biology predicts that asexual, all-female reproduction is more efficient in terms of passing on genes to the next generation.  This is a key unresolved question in biology, with important implications for human genetics.  Our work on the evolution of life histories addresses two main issues, how placentation evolves in mammals, and how lifespan has evolved.  These studies use variation among species in placental and life-history traits, and in the genes that appear to underly these traits, to sort out what genes, and what changes in these genes, have been most important in mediating their development and evolution.  Finally, we are studying the genetic bases of autism and schizophrenia, the two main disorders involving human social behaviour, from evolutionary perspectives, to generate insights into what causes these diseases and what can be done to alleviate them.",Environnement,"D�veloppement du nord","Evolution & Ecology",1,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"The static analysis of ""non-cooperative"" games has long been used by economic game theorists to predict a player's rational choice in human conflict situations. It has also become the accepted method to predict long term individual behaviors in an evolving biological population through the game-theoretic solution of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). My research proposal is to analyze the dynamics of evolutionary games relevant for biological systems, paying particular attention to the dynamic stability of equilibria found in the above static analysis. This is an active area of research with many applied mathematicians as well as theoretical biologists involved.

   There are several specific areas of evolutionary game theory that I will concentrate on. One area is coevolutionary models in ecology. Coevolution here includes changing population sizes of several species in the ecosystem as well as changing patterns of individual behavior within each species. For instance, when there are several habitats, game-theoretic intuition suggests a species will distribute itself among these habitats according to the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) whereby all individuals have the same ""fitness"". My research examines if this IFD is an ESS and/or dynamically stable; otherwise one does not expect to observe this equilibrium state in nature. An application of such models is to predator-prey systems when prey face a tradeoff between accessing a refuge with limited food supply versus habitats where they are not safe from predation. Another application involves the use of ""extensive form games"" that describe the sequential decision making resulting from ongoing interactions among the same individuals. For example, prey may have a choice of habitat followed by different possible behaviors depending on where they and their predators live. A more technical area of proposed research involves continuous trait spaces and adaptive dynamics, a current area of much research. The goal here is again to predict the outcome of evolution as populations adapt to their changing environment and to the changing populations around them.

"Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI) are devestating events that usually leave victims paritally or completly paralyzed below the level of the injury. These injuries happen most often to healthy young men in their 20st but the vulnerable child and elderly populations also suffer these injuries, and their devestating consequences, at an alarming rate. 



The long-term objectives of this research program are to experimentally determine the mechanisms of spinal cord injury at the level of the spinal column (bones, discs and ligaments of the spine) and spinal cord and especially at the interface of the cord and column. These SCI injury mechanisms are poorly understood at all ages although the injury mechanisms at the level of the spinal column has been extensively studied in healthy adults and for this reason column injury mechanisms in this population are the best understood presently. However, this work has primarily been done using cadaveric spinal columns and little work has been done incorporating either muscles and/or Spinal Cord tissue. If the effect of musculature, spinal posture, spinal column degeneration (in the elderly) and spinal column development (in children) could be determined then many advances in injury prevention and treatment would result. For instance it would allow the development of improved age-specific injury prevention devices, improved clinical screening techniques, improved playground, geriatric and automotive environments, improved conditioning exercises and improved treatments for SCI that are tailored to the actual age-related cord injuries. This application is the first renewal of my original NSERC Discovery Grant on this topic that was funded for five years starting in 2003. We have used the original grant to establish ongoing projects to develop an improved sports and transportation helmet to prevent spinal cord injuries during head first impact, to establish the relationship between spinal stenosis and the risk for spinal cord injury in the elderly and to understand the benefits of cerebrospinal fluid drainage as a treatment after spinal cord injury.

"The invertebrate sampling equipment includes one inflatable, heavy duty and high capacity boat and an array of plankton and benthic nets of various mesh sizes and mouth openings. This equipment will support diverse research projects in my lab which can be categorized into few main areas: recombination, mutation and genome evolution and the evolution of invasiveness. 

A) Recombination and genome evolution:  Recent evidence suggests that ameiotic recombination could be of significant evolutionary importance for explaining the long term maintenance of clonal lineages. Research in my lab is contrasting recombination rates in various populations of Daphnia pulex from pond and lake habitats. B) The metal-induced mutation process: from genomes to natural populations. In collaborations with national and international colleagues my lab is developing large ecological genomics projects that combine interdisciplinary perspective to provide broad-based insights into the mutational effects of chronic heavy metal loads. These projects aim to directly estimate genome-wide mutation rates and spectra in aquatic model organisms (e.g., Daphnia, Hyalella), and to assess the impact of heavy metals on deleterious mutation loads in natural populations. C) The evolution of invasiveness: The central theme of this research program is to study the evolution of traits that underlie invasiveness. Specifically this project aims to characterize both spatial and temporal patterns of genetic structure during the establishment and subsequent spread of invasive tunicates and to contrast the selective regimes of invasive species in both native and introduced ranges. 

These projects involve intensive sampling of aquatic invertebrates across the native and invasive range. The availability of robust, simple and versatile sampling equipment is critical to all these studies. This equipment will support existing research programs and timely completion of graduate research.

"Although recombination is a dominant force in promoting genome evolution, it remains one of the deepest mysteries in nature. Recombination provides evolution flexibility in the face of a constantly changing environment and reduces the risk of extinction by mutational meltdown. However, most phyla have lineages that do not engage in sex and inherit their genomes as indivisible blocks (e.g., ostracods, bdelloid rotifers, euglenoids). These taxa in which the benefits of recombination are likely outweighed by the costs of sexual reproduction represent ideal study systems for investigating the causes and consequences of recombination. 



I use the small crustacean Daphnia as a model system to study the role of recombination in the tempo and mode of genome evolution. The peculiar life cycle of Daphnia involves the alternation of sexual and asexual reproduction (cyclic parthenogenesis) making possible the study of recombination among populations with variable sexual investment. Moreover, the existence of populations which lost completely the ability of engaging in sexual reproduction (obligate asexual) permits the investigation of recombination in both sexual and asexual populations. 



The main questions that I address are: (i) Why is meiotic recombination prevalent among eukaryotes? (ii) What role does ameiotic recombination play in the evolution of asexual genomes? and (iii) What is the nature and scale of recombination rate variation across genomes?

"Hydrogen is considered by many as the fuel of the future because of its cleanness when utilized in combustion systems or in electrochemical devices. Although abundant in nature, it is not available in its molecular form and thus must be extracted from its parent compound (e.g. reforming of fossil fuel or electrolysis of water). The present proposal focuses on two technologies for hydrogen production from carbonaceous feedstock:



1. Gasification of Glycerol in Supercritical Water (SCW) for Producing High-Pressure Hydrogen: The objective is to generate hydrogen at high pressure in order to reduced subsequent compression cost. Glycerol was selected because it is the major by-product from bio-diesel manufacturing. Clycerol will be gasified in SCW, that is at pressure and temperature above 22.1 MPa and 374C, respectively. SCW possesses unique properties that makes it ideal for reforming reactions. For example, SCW can issolve any organic compound, which is very beneficial in reducing the amount of tar which can be produced in significant amount during gasification in sub-critical water. 



2. Catalytic Cracking of Methane for High Purity Hydrogen Production: this technology has the merit of generating very high purity hydrogen without carbon monoxide (which is a poison for PEM fuel cell) and without complicated purification steps. It also has the advantage of being less endothermic than conventional steam reforming of natural gas. Beside hydrogen, the other reaction product is solid carbon in the form of carbon filaments, which can be in part recovered as useful by-product. The quality of the carbon formed depends on the operating conditions and the catalyst used, and obviously can affect considerably the economics of the process. In the proposed research we will optimize the catalyst and develop a simulation of the whole process, based on fluidized bed reactors.

"Recent research points to a dramatic increase in the volume of raw spatial data. The ability to generate massive amounts of spatial data (in particular imagery) is likely to further intensify with the introduction of new earth observation systems, GPS-enabled mobile devices, and other emerging technologies such as wireless geo-sensor networks. These trends have created an entirely new situation, in which our ability to generate spatial data (and in particular imagery) surpasses our ability to organize, process, and analyze it. Furthermore, the unprecedented wealth of sensory devices has made it possible to rapidly collect spatial data over time, resulting in large amounts of spatio-temporal data. A primary emerging research challenge is therefore the development of efficient, reliable, and robust methods and paradigms for inferring and discovering high-level knowledge from such data, while addressing the complex and dynamic nature of spatial entities. In light of this, the fundamental challenge addressed is how to relate low-level raw pixel data in remotely sensed imagery time series to high level qualitative spatio-temporal knowledge which is not explicitly stored in the imagery. Such qualitative knowledge should allow representing all aspects of a dynamic physical system (space,time, and quantity), and support automated reasoning. The objective of this proposal is to develop data models and algorithms for modeling, abstraction, and qualitative knowledge discovery in spatio-temporal remotely sensed imagery data.

"Many of the world's most abundant organisms depend critically upon larval stages that are poorly understood in terms of their form and function.  The seas are full of such invertebrate larvae, which permit dispersal and thus ensure replenishment of populations, continued genetic diversity and colonisation of novel geographic regions. Such larval forms are essential for economically important species in the wild and present challenges during aquaculture.  From the perspective of fundamental biological principles, understanding larval stages is also essential for explaining the development of subsequent adult body plans and the evolution of the very biodiversity upon which the world relies.  Our lab, together with only a handful of others worldwide, has recently made major inroads in describing the form and function of larvae of one of the most important phyla of marine organisms: the molluscs.  In this application, we propose to examine how the larval nervous system controls the cilia and muscles used to generate swimming and feeding behaviours in the common intertidal snail, Ilyanassa.  We will start by using techniques which have already proven useful in our hands (immunocytochemistry , behavioural pharmacology) to identify neurotransmitters in the nevous system and determine their roles.  However, to understand the functions of individual neurons, we will need to use electrophysiology, coupled with modern optical imaging techniques.  These studies will involve the use of microelectrodes to impale single larval neurons, which can be visualized with vital stains or DIC optics, and will permit the study of cellular characteristics and synaptic connections.  Simultaneous dye injections will reveal detailed anatomy.  We will also turn to state-of-the-art optical imaging techniques which will permit us to study activity of both single neurons and populations of cells.  These studies will comprise the first detailed analyses of the larval nervous system of molluscs at the cellular level and provide a basis for future comparisons across the molluscs and between phyla.

"Thoracic blunt trauma ranks only second to head injury in terms of total fatal injuries in automobile crash. Further, it is estimated that thoracic trauma contributes to approximately 70% of disabling injuries and deaths in vehicle crashes, with traffic collisions being a leading cause of premature death and long term disability in Canada. Thoracic injury is most commonly observed in side impact vehicle crash for the occupant on the struck side of the vehicle and includes damage to the thoracic cage (rib fracture) as well as lung and heart injury.

   Vehicles and safety systems are assessed using advanced numerical modeling techniques to understand performance and safety prior to constructing physical prototypes. One of the biggest challenges is to evaluate the potential for occupant injury in different crash scenarios. Historically, this has been accomplished using crash test dummies, and more recently using numerical models of these dummies. However, evolving vehicle designs using lightweight materials and increasing crash performance requirements require detailed predictive methods to evaluate the potential for occupant injury. To address this need, we propose to advance a state of the art thoracic numerical model with the goal of predicting injury at the local (organ) level. This will provide an essential tool for evaluating and improving safety and vehicle crashworthiness, and expanding current knowledge in local, organ-based injury prediction.

    The proposed research program will expand existing knowledge of injury biomechanics through improved understanding of local response and injury, while providing an essential tool to evaluate occupant safety in automobile crash scenarios. This predictive model will provide the ability to evaluate new crash situations and safety systems, and ultimately improve vehicle design for crashworthiness. The research will address a vital need for Canadian research personnel trained in trauma prevention and design for safety and vehicle crashworthiness. It will lead to better methods by which to evaluate trauma and improve protection for the human body in new areas including protective sports equipment, and personal protection.

"Crack in Corrosion (CIC) has been identified in operating pipelines as a hybrid defect where a crack or crack colony occurs coincidentally with a significant amount of corrosion. It is of utmost importance to develop a reliable and consistent means of evaluating the remaining strength of CIC defects to determine the appropriate action in terms of repair or removal. A preliminary investigation has highlighted the need for improved evaluation methods. More detailed studies and complete experimental data are required to validate new methods and understand the applicability of existing methods to this type of defect.



The focus of this study is to undertake a detailed experimental testing program in order to provide current data  that will critically assess existing techniques and validate new techniques for the evaluation of CIC defects,. The program will include applying advanced numerical methods and the Failure Assessment Diagram concept. This study will enable pipeline companies to improve their maintenance schedules and become more cost effective with enhanced reliability. Pipeline repairs can then be carried out in a timelier and cost efficient manner.

"Canada is a land of many climates and environments, from temperate forest to tundra and prairie to alpine. Plants are adapted to these environments and, even within a species, populations may be found that are genetically adapted to local environments. Precise adaptation of this sort is essential for productive plant growth in agriculture and forestry but the genetic basis of this process is incompletely known. The long term objective of this program of research is to use recent advances in genomics to determine the genome-wide architecture of plant adaptation. The main focus will be on the black cottonwood trees of British Columbia, which we have shown to exhibit extensive local adaptation to the varied terrain. Knowledge of plant adaptation is important for predicting the effect of climate change on ecosystems and for forest improvement and will facilitate conservation and appropriate use of native Canadian trees.



Short term objectives include mapping the fine scale distribution and performance of black cottonwood genotypes along an altitudinal gradient, using global positioning systems (GPS) and relating them to  environmental variables using geographical information systems (GIS). Transplant experiments and newly developed (""next generation"") sequencing technology will be used to simultaneously determine gene expression and genetic variation of high altitude and low altitude clones cultivated in contrasting environments. Outlier analysis will be used to select genes that are extreme in their reaction to altitude (either in terms of gene expression, or by partitioning genetic variation into ""high altitude"" and ""low altitude"" genotypes). ~100 outlier genes will be chosen for confirmation by further sampling and quantitative expression analysis. Ten of these genes will be investigated in detail, including by ""knock down"" experiments using virus induced gene silencing (VIGS). This study will constitute one of the most intensive studies of local adaptation at the genome level ever carried out.

"Direct exposure to superheated steam or hot saturated environments is a hazard for workers in the energy sector and other heavy industries. Several such incidents have been reported where workers were seriously injured, demonstrating a need for materials designed to protect against such hazards, and appropriate methods to evaluate materials for this application. Textile materials for use in flame resistant (FR) steam protective clothing systems must be evaluated for both steam/hot water permeation/penetration and energy transfer. Specifications for clothing systems and new garments must be developed to prevent skin burns from energy transfer during or after exposure. University of Alberta researchers recently concluded an initial investigation of steam/hot water permeability properties of FR protective clothing wherein a prototype evaluation device and procedure were developed. This proposal represents a continuation of that research to complete the work. Expected outcomes of the proposed research are: development of theoretical numerical models incorporating test parameters, fabric characteristics and fabric performance properties; optimization of existing evaluation protocols and further development of the laboratory-scale test device for working at higher steam pressure; and development of specifications for textile materials and garment designs to protect against steam/hot condensate exposure. 

   A major benefit to Canada will be enhanced worker safety. No standard test device or protocol exists to evaluate steam protective materials. Canadian industry, especially the energy sector, will benefit from a better understanding of the hazard and of protection strategies. Outcomes of this research will offer opportunities for Canadian high-tech textile and apparel firms to be world leaders in the development of protective materials and garments, and for the Canadian energy sector to be pioneers in their use.

"My principal interest is the structure of magnetic nanostructures engineered from ferromagnetic/ non-ferro- magnetic layers epitaxially grown on semiconductors.  The correct interpretation of the magnetic behaviour in such systems- the magnetic anisotropy and interlayer coupling- is strongly dependent on the nature of the interface between layers, the strain in the layers and the extent of any interdiffusion or reaction between layers and substrate. The same factors are important to improving spintronic devices which depend upon the efficiency with which an electron carries its spin through a metal-semiconductor interface. 

   We examine these factors with synchrotron radiation structural techniques applied in situ in two molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) facilities which we constructed at the PNC/XOR (Pacific Northwest Consortium/ X-ray Optics and Research) beamlines, Advanced Photon Source, IL. We study metallic films as they are grown epitaxially, layer by layer. Our structural techniques include XAFS (x-ray absorption fine structure), specular and diffuse x-ray reflectivity, x-ray standing waves and surface x-ray diffraction. We have examined extensively Fe/GaAs, Pd/Fe/GaAs and Fe/Pd/Fe/GaAs and will continue with related systems.

    A persistent problem is the origin of the uniaxial  in-plane magnetic crystalline anisotropy at the  Fe-GaAs interface. We have found an in-plane structural anisotropy for 2 ML Fe but not for 4 ML and thicker films. We will determine if the in-plane structural anisotropy is a universal feature, independent of the surface reconstruction of GaAs. At the submonolayer level we will attempt to determine if a Fe-GaAs complex forms at the interface and what is its ""crystal"" structure. We will also look for Fe complexes at the Fe/AlGaAs interface in Fe/AlGaAs/GaAs which has a high electron spin-injection efficiency.

    We are examining spin dynamics in ferrimagnetic amorphous GdCo alloys. In a sub-nanosecond  time- resolved experiment we pulse the sample temperature with the PNC/XOR 200 femtosecond laser and use x-ray magnetic circular dischroism to follow the magnetization as the Gd and Co sub-lattices re-orient.

"Chirality is a property that many molecules possess. It is often compared to handedness since chiral molecules are identical except for being right- or left-handed. Chirality is widely prevalent in nature: from the spiral of snail shells to the helical twist in DNA.  Nineteen of the twenty essential amino acids are chiral, and in mammalian species, these exist only in their left-handed forms. Chirality also plays an important role in materials chemistry.  Chiral devices are used in a broad range of applications to control and manipulate light.  For example, chiral smectic liquid crystal films switch the pixels of liquid crystal displays on and off thousands of times faster than current commercial liquid crystal-based devices.  These chiral liquid crystal-based devices represent the next generation of liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, and also have potential uses in telecom applications as switchable waveguides and interconnects and in high-resolution 2-D and 3-D (holographic) projection. Magnetoresistance in chiral nanostructures may enable development of novel magnetic field sensors for use in magnetic memory devices (hard disks and magnetic solid state memory), allowing increased storage densities and data transfer rates. The recent emergence of 3D cinema is a good example of the application of chiral materials, where they are used to rapidly project alternate left- and right-eye images in orthogonal circular polarizations (the glasses worn by the audience filter the projected images to each eye creating the 3D effect). Older technologies used linearly polarized light, and induced nausea due to sensitivity to head tilt. The circular polarizers now used greatly reduce these effects. With an increasing number of applications of chiral materials, there is an increasing need to prepare and analyze these unique structures.  However, the analysis of the chirality of chiral solids and films is extremely difficult.  One method is to use Diffuse Reflectance Circular Dichroism (CD), which is a modification of a regular CD instrument such that many of the artifacts and difficulties associated with carrying out the CD of solids are eliminated. This instrument is also designed so that sensitive films and hydrogels can be analyzed while they sit horizontally.

"Chiral chromatography is used to separate enantiomers, which are chemical compounds that are identical to each other except in the orientation of the atoms in space. Enantiomers are virtually indistinguishable in terms of physical properties (melting point, boiling point, spectroscopic data, etc.) but, when placed in a biological environment they can have hugely different properties. In the case of Thalidomide, one enantiomer cures morning sickness, one causes birth defects. In ethambutol, one enantiomer treats tuberculosis, the other causes blindness. The reason for this is that our biochemical machinery is made up of pure enantiomers of amino acids, which can recognize the different enantiomers. Thus pharmaceutical companies need to determine the biological activities of both enantiomers, and in general need to either prepare them in pure form, which is difficult, or separate them. Early on in the process of screening drug candidates, where pure forms of one or the other enantiomer are needed for testing, companies do not want to invest significant amounts of time investment to develop an efficient route since this time may be wasted if the compound fails a toxicity screen. Basically, the more quickly a compound can be made, the more quickly it can be screened for bioactivity and toxicity.   Therefore efficient methods of enantiomeric separation, like preparative scale chiral chromatography are critical in the early stages of chiral drug development. With modern screening technology, an effective separation method can be found within days as opposed to the months that it may take to develop a highly effective enantioselective synthesis. Thus we propose to develop a novel type of chiral stationary phase. The material is an organic/inorganic composite with pores in the nano/meso region. It is prepared by condensation of chiral biaryl-based monomers around a surfactant template which is used to introduce porosity and control structure. The students involved in this project will be trained in organic synthesis, in order to make the chiral monomers, and in materials and analytical chemistry. They will have close interactions with our partners, Merck Frosst and Silicycle, the largest chromatography company in Canada.

"Both deformation and magmatic activity are strongly localized in all tectonic settings and at all scales.  My research program over the next five years will focus on the nature and physical controls on such localization.  The characteristics of localized deformation and intrusive igneous activity in a variety of tectonic settings will be determined by a combination of field and geophysical observations and geochronology.  The physical mechanisms and controls on localization will be investigated by a program of three-dimensional physical modeling, using a recently established experimental tectonics laboratory, complemented by two-dimensional numerical experiments.  Efforts will be focused on the following sub-projects to be carried out by up to 4 graduate students per year and one post doctoral fellow.



1. Localization of deformation and plutonic activity in continental magmatic arcs.

2. Erosion as an agent of localization in orogenic belts. 

3. Crustal-scale models of shear zone localization in wide, hot orogens.  

4. Localization and growth of evaporate structures.

"Support is sought to continue investigation of fundamental problems in assessing and mitigating the risks from landsliding on the Interior Plains and in the Canadian Cordillera.  Better understanding of these risks contributes to the sustainable development of communities and minimizes impacts on resource (forest, energy, fishing, mining) industries and on transportation facilities (roads, railways and pipelines).



Our recent work on natural slopes in the Rockies has resulted in a process diagram showing how the mode of movement (buckling, sliding or toppling) depends on the orientations of both the bedding and the slope.  Studies of slopes with azimuths at substantial angles to the strike of bedding or foliation indicate that steeper slopes with several kinematic modes of movement are possible.  Such slopes may present significant hazards along the trans-continental routes through the Cordillera.  Studies of the slopes in the Yellowhead Pass and the Crowsnest Pass in cooperation with the CNR and CPR are planned to continue.  Our studies of the east slope of Turtle Mountain and the Frank Slide are proceeding with the support and cooperation of Alberta Government agencies.  Our research in the Peace River Lowlands documented five of the largest, historic rapid landslides on the Interior Plains of North America.  The landslides have dammed tributaries of the Peace and the eroded remains of these landslide dams continue to obstruct flow, pond water and drown trees.  We have recently described similar landslides in similar materials in the Thompson River Valley, south of Ashcroft, BC, where they endanger the main transcontinental railway lines and the salmon fishery.  The slides undergo small, slow movements in response to the drawdown of the Thompson after its spring floods.  There is evidence that much larger, rapid movements have occurred, movements similar to those seen in the Peace River Lowlands.  We propose to investigate the inter relationships of these two modes of movement at instrumented sites on the Thompson and the Little Smokey River with the cooperation of the railways and Alberta Transportation.

The study of mixed-valence complexes will increase the basic knowledge of these compounds and lead to new theories.  This greater understanding will be used to optimize mixed-valence properties for faster and smaller devices in the field of photonics (light controlled devices).  One of the simplest devices is the on/off switch.  A photoswitch is the ultimate goal of research into photoisomerism and cyanamide mixed-valence complexes.  In this case, a light-driven change in geometry alters the flow of electrons within a compound.  Incorporation of this compound into a conducting material would have the effect of controlling electrical current by exposure of the material to light.  Another type of photoswitch is one which controls the intensity of light exiting a device by taking advantage of the hyperpolarizability of cyanamide mixed-valence complexes.  When the dipole moment of the mixed-valence complex is aligned with other mixed-valence complexes in a polymer matrix, it will be possible to change the non-linear properties of the material by application of an electric field and in so doing control the phase of light passing through the material.  Devices such as Mach-Zehnder interferometers, birefringent modulators and directional couplers can make use of these novel materials.

"Up to the mid 19th century or so, mathematics was mostly algorithmic. Proofs of existence were usually done by giving an actual construction of the object. As mathematics began to become more abstract, people began to study the notions of algorithms and computability. The first stumbling block was on the definition of what it meant to be algorithmic or computable. When faced with an algorithm, people would agree that it was one, but how would one show that something could not be computed, or solved by an algorithm? By the 1930s, work of Turing and others culminated in an acceptable notion of computability.



Since the 1930s, computability theory has developed far beyond just checking what is computable and what is not. We have notions of relative computability, where we say A is computed from B if there is some program that can compute A if it is allowed to refer (finitely often) to an infinite tape coding B.



In this project, I propose to study various areas of mathematics, and use computability theory to examine the complexity of the proofs. This can help answer questions such as how difficult is it to prove one thing compared to another? Is the original proof the most efficient? By studying these properties, we can find out interesting phenomena about the area of mathematics being studied, often leading to further insight.

"The underlying theme of our research program revolves around dynamic processes. Ultimately, we are aiming for a deeper understanding of the interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics in various chemical systems. Three specific topics under investigation are:



(i) Molecular folding and unfolding - Foldamers are oligomers or polymers that have well-defined and predictable folding properties in solution. This research deals with backbone rigidified foldamers where local conformational preferences stabilize folded molecular structures.



(ii) The genesis of molecular 'handedness' - The intriguing topic of molecular asymmetry has captured the interest of many scientists since the second half of the nineteenth century. Recent experiments in our laboratory have shown that under a continuous and dynamic dissolution-crystallization process, a racemic population of ethylenediamine sulphate crystals can be driven into crystals of a single handedness (i.e. stochastic mirror symmetry breaking).



(iii) The use of reversible reactions to investigate molecular binding and amplification - Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry (DCC) involves the creation of a dynamic mixture of compounds carried out under reversible equilibrating conditions. This thermodynamic adaptive chemistry relies on and takes advantage of dynamic molecular exchanges and interactions where bonds are continuously formed and broken.

"Predicting population size and spatial distribution lies at the heart of management plans for biological control, fisheries, disease, wildlife, invasive species, and endangered species. It is no surprise that abiotic environmental conditions are important determinants of population dynamics.  However, some species have large effects on the physical environment which alter populations. For example, plant architecture creates physical structure in space, which may alter abiotic factors (e.g., wind speed) in the immediate vicinity of the organism. This alteration of the physical environment may impact both the plant's own population and the populations of other species. In my research program, I investigate the effects of small-scale spatial and temporal structure of the environment on the dynamics and spread of populations. More importantly, I also study how organisms themselves create or modify this structure in order to predict how such feedback between organisms and physical environment alters our ability to manage populations. I propose three subprojects that each address aspects of this overall research program. First, I will develop a simple and general modelling framework to describe the feedback between organisms and physical environment. Second, I will examine the role of climate variation, and organism modification of climate conditions, in determining establishment probabilities and spread rates of non-native species. Finally, I propose to develop and test general models which predict the effects of plant architecture on the pest species such as aphids, and the ability beneficial predators, such as minute pirate bugs and lacewings, to control these agricultural pests. Together these projects will provide both theory and experimental data which may demonstrate the importance of considering organism-environment interactions when predicting population dynamics.

"I have for many years investigated music perception and cognition as a Canadian pioneer in the field, and each experimental project has revealed new and abundant information about the organization of thought and the brain.  I have developed new tests and new ways of thinking about the theoretical implications of research in the field.  The study of music listening is richly rewarding as it can teach us how we perceive, remember, and form preferences for the auditory world around us.  Music also conveys emotion, which is striking when we consider that it does so without the use of words and without the requirement of formal music training.  In the present proposal I will address intriguing questions that have arisen such as:  (1) As well as fostering emotional communication, music is structured and memorable. Why are these features available to all listeners, not just musicians? There are acknowledged perceptual benefits and advantages from music training, but in many instances the skills of the average listener accomplish musical understanding and appreciation.  Why is this?  (2) Prosody is a music-like characteristic of speech.  It is the ""ups and downs"" in the voice that accompany the words of an utterance. Prosody involves patterns of timing,  loudness, and pitch, and these patterns influence meaning and convey emotion.  To what extent are all listeners sensitive to these patterns?  Which depend on music training and why?  (3)  As a part of the proposed research I will look at special populations such as the  ""tone deaf"" and neurologically compromised individuals who have either selective loss of musical abilities following brain damage or selective sparing of musical memories following the onset of dementia.   Research with these populations is illuminating the brain systems underlying fundamental psychological processes such as memory, emotion and language.    Training high quality personnel is a major component of the funding request.  For the granting period, I anticipate supporting four or five graduate students, one or two postdoctoral fellows, and 20 part-time undergraduate research assistants or thesis students.

"Nanoscale science and technology is one of the fastest growing research areas in recent years. Nanostructures or devices are typically fabricated by lithography, etching and thin film deposition techniques. Among various nano-lithographic technologies, nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is the choice for high throughput patterning of nanostructures. Similar to CD/DVD duplication process, it is based on mechanical hot embossing principle onto thermoplastic polymers that become soft when heated (thermal NIL). Another popular form of NIL is based on ultraviolet light curing and hardening of a mixture called resist that consists of pre-polymers and additives (UV-NIL). Besides its high throughput, NIL has ultra high resolution of sub-5 nanometers, which is beyond the limitations set by light diffraction as in photolithography or beam scattering as in electron beam lithography. Therefore, NIL is considered as the most suitable lithography for mass production of many nano-devices.



The objectives of this proposal is to design, fabricate (by NIL) and characterize the following devices: 1) chemical and biosensors based on surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and extraordinary optical transmission through nano-hole array in noble metals, which are both label-free with high sensitivity; 2) optical negative refractive index metamaterials offering unique optical properties absent in normal materials; 3) nanostructured plastic solar cells having enhanced energy conversion efficiency; 4) transparent and conductive metal nanostructures suitable for electrode for organic semiconductor devices; and 5) bit-patterned magnetic recording media capable of areal density well beyond 1 Terabit/in^2.

"Brain imaging (particularly functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI) has become one of the dominant techniques of the 21st century for understanding how the human brain works.  For example, brain imaging has revealed that the human visual system contains a number of specialized brain areas that are devoted to processing various aspects of objects.  Different brain areas analyze objects in terms of their form, color and texture, how they feel, how they might be grasped, or in the case of tools, how they might be used. Because of technical challenges with functional MRI, almost all of these studies have studied two-dimensional (2D) pictures of objects and tools, which are very different from real three-dimensional (3D) objects and tools.  For example, you wouldn't expect a photograph of a hammer to feel heavy, nor would you consider grasping it and using it to pound in a nail.  My lab is one of the few worldwide that has developed novel techniques for studying real 3D objects and tools using functional MRI.  Because our work is so unique, we need specialized equipment.  First, we need equipment to present a series of objects in the confined space of an MRI scanner.  Second, we need equipment to monitor the participants' performance, to monitor their ability to remain still in the scanner, and to monitor their brain activation moment-by-moment.  Third, we need equipment to measure participants' behavior in similar situations outside the MRI scanner (for example, when they grasp, move, or use tools).  This requires one sophisticated camera system to track markers on the participant's fingers and hands and an additional camera system to track where each of the two eyes is looking.  This research will enable us to better understand how the brain recognizes and acts upon objects.  It will be useful for interpreting brain disorders in patients who have problems recognizing objects or performing actions.  It may even contribute to the development of neural prosthetics, enabling brain implants to guide movements of an artificial robotic arm to real world objects.

"The oceanographic community is undertaking a major international program (GEOTRACES http://www.geotraces.org/) to study the marine biogeochemical cycling of trace elements and isotopes and to elucidate the oceanographic information embedded in their distribution. The program consists of sampling detailed water column sections in all major ocean basins, complemented by process and time-series studies in strategically located regions and will carry with it a heavy analytical burden. The scale of this program is unprecedented in the field of chemical oceanography and promises to provide a quantum leap forward in the understanding of ocean processes past and present and their role in Earth's changing climate system. For instance, some trace elements, such as Co, Cu, Fe, and Zn, are essential micronutrients. A better understanding of the factors controlling the distribution and speciation of these potentially biolimiting micronutrients will provide critical information for understanding their role in regulating the structure and productivity of marine ecosystems, the efficiency of these ecosystems at sequestering carbon dioxide and their sensitivity to climate change. This proposal requests funds to acquire components to assemble a flow injection analysis (FIA)/sequence injection analysis (SIA) system designed for the chemiluminescent, colorimetric and fluorometric detection of bioactive trace metals and reactive oxygen species in seawater. These analytical approaches have proven to be cost effective, high throughput, precise techniques for near real-time determinations of dissolved trace metals in seawater that can meet the requirements of analytically intense programs like GEOTRACES.

"Improvements in sampling and analytical techniques are driving a period of rapid discovery in the field of chemical oceanography and marine biogeochemistry. The distribution of trace elements and isotopes in seawater provides important information on how processes in the ocean influenced the Earth's climate in the past and will impact changing climate in the future. For example, certain trace elements like iron and zinc can be important factors in determining the biological productivity of the oceans. This productivity has a large impact on the ability of the oceans to absorb anthropogenic carbon dioxide, thus impacting climate and global change. In addition, trace elements and isotopes are useful indicators of the circulation of the oceans in the present and provide records of past ocean conditions, but only when factors controlling element and isotope behavior in the modern ocean are sufficiently understood. Research of this nature requires state of the art equipment that can provide samples of uncontaminated seawater with high temporal and spatial resolution. The dedicated oceanographic winch requested here will complement a trace element clean sampling system being built up and managed by a UVic/UBC consortium of research scientists. With this purpose built winch the trace element clean sampling system will enable a wider group of Canadian research scientists to participate in ongoing global studies and high resolution regional studies that will provide invaluable information for oceanographic and climate change research.","Oc�ans, mers et estuaires",Environnement,"Environmental Earth Sciences",1,"EQPEQ ","Research Tools and Instruments - Category 1 (<$150,000)","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique
"The distribution and bioavailability of essential trace elements can impact marine productivity, ecosystem structure and air-sea exchange of greenhouse gases. An understanding of the response of marine biogeochemical cycles to global change must, therefore, include studies of trace element sources, sinks, and chemical speciation.  This is because marine microbes have absolute requirements for trace element nutrients that can help explain temporal-spatial variability in microbial community structure and set upper limits on carbon and nitrogen fixation in the sea. The bioavailability of trace element nutrients to marine microbes is controlled not only by the concentration but the speciation, or chemical form, that essential elements take in seawater. In turn, microorganisms can affect the distribution and speciation of trace elements through biologically mediated uptake/exudation, redox reactions and the production of strong organic ligands that complex dissolved trace elements in the water column. The proposed research program will investigate how changing hydrography and ocean acidification will affect the bioavailability of trace element nutrients in marine surface waters and continue studies of the dominant mechanisms that control interactions between marine microbes and trace metals in coastal and open ocean environments. The long term goals of the program are to provide an understanding of how changes in the distribution and availability of bioactive trace metals to marine microbes affect: 1) the magnitude of C and N fluxes into and out of the surface ocean, and, 2) the elemental and isotopic composition of the sinking flux of particulate matter to the ocean interior.

"We naturally reorient our eyes to targets of interest located at different eccentricities and depths. However how the brain ensures the precise control of binocular positioning remains highly controversial.

Objective: The main objective of this study is to understand how the brain generates disjunctive saccades. In our recent work, we have shown that the neurons of the brainstem saccadic generator, which are typically considered a source of purely conjugate premotor drive, in fact provide temporally appropriate vergence information to drive eye motion during disjunctive saccades. In the present proposal, we will take this work to the next stage and identify the source of the vergence-related signals of premotor saccadic neurons. One obvious candidate is the superior colliculus, which receives inputs from disparity sensitive cortical regions such as the frontal eye fields. Additional vergence inputs to premotor saccadic neurons could come from the cerebellum and/or its deep nuclei. In particular, the oculomotor vermis and caudal fastigial nucleus have important projections to the premotor saccadic region and contain neurons whose discharges are related to saccades. Finally, neurons in the midbrain such as vergence-velocity neurons, which have only been characterized during smooth vergence, may also play a role in driving disjunctive saccades by means of their direct projections to the extraocular motoneurons. Each of these possibilities will be systematically explored.

Scientific Approach: The activity of single neurons in alert behaving monkeys will be quantified during saccade-vergence interactions in alert behaving monkeys. System identification techniques developed in our laboratory will be used to describe the discharge dynamics of neurons during conjugate and disjunctive movements. The resultant data will be interpreted in the context of current models of the oculomotor system. 

Experimental Significance: Results will be used to generate theoretical models of the networks that control saccade-facilitated vergence.  These models will, in turn, provide a foundation that can be used to understand how the brain coordinates the movement of multiple muscles to generate more complex voluntary movements.

"Genetic-based therapeutics use materials such as short pieces of DNA to either stop the expression of specific

disease creating genes or to precisely replace genes missing in genetic disorders. This class of drugs has

revolutionary therapeutic potential in many indications including most cancers, cardiovascular diseases,

autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and genetic disorders. However, the development of such

therapeutics is challenged by the delivery of genetic materials to diseased cells; genetic materials delivered

without a vehicle are both unable to enter cells to affect biological processes and are rapidly degraded in the

human body. Recent research has demonstrated that the encapsulation of genetic materials in appropriately

designed lipid nanoparticles (LNP) can solve these delivery problems. However, current methods for

formulating LNP containing genetic therapeutics are laborious, have limited reproducibility, are difficult to

scale and cannot be readily used for many lipid compositions. We have developed a novel platform technology

that enables rapid formulation of LNP siRNA systems to solve many of these issues. The apparatus currently

exists as a prototype system that needs to be made user friendly and optimized for routine bench scale and

intermediate scale LNP production. This proposal seeks funds to develop a prototype formulator instrument

that can be used broadly by the drug development community.

Our approach to the formulation of LNP encapsulated genetic therapeutics has the promise to revolutionize the

genetic therapeutics market by providing a viable, much needed delivery solution. This platform technology

will support a growing cluster of Canadian companies focused on genetic-based therapeutics, accelerating the

time-to-market for critical therapeutics, and raising the international profile of technology in Canada.

Additionally, this technology will be the basis for a Canadian based spin-off company, which will be poised to

seize on the tremendous growth in genetic-based therapeutics.","Sciences m�dicales et de la sant�","Avancement des connaissances","RPP Internal Decision Cttee","1 & 2","I2IPJ ","Idea to Innovation","British Columbia",Colombie-Britannique

"Diagnosing the cause of degraded river ecosystem condition is difficult because river organisms are simultaneously exposed to multiple environmental stressors (e.g., toxic chemicals, nutrients, suspended sediments) that can adversely affect them.  Although environmental stressors can have complex, interactive effects on biological communities, these cumulative consequences are rarely considered in regulatory guidelines.  Organisms living in rivers draining agricultural landscapes are at particular risk because they are exposed to sediments, nutrients and pesticides. The proposed research will provide the building blocks needed to improve knowledge of the interactive effects that pesticides, excess nutrients and sediments have on food webs in agricultural rivers.  The research will: (1) establish the effects on river insects of commonly used pesticides, both alone and in combination, and evaluate competing predictive models; (2) examine the role nutrients may have in masking the effects of pesticides through experiments conducted in artificial streams; and (3) test the combined effects on river invertebrates of pesticides, nutrients and excess sediments across a simulated agricultural gradient.  Key predictions are that: (1) river insects will respond to non-lethal pesticide exposure through decreased abundance and body size; (2) these negative effects will be moderated by mild nutrient pollution; and (3) sedimentation will worsen the negative effects of pesticides. The research will train 2 MSc, 2 PhD and 5 undergraduate students, and increase our knowledge of nutrient-contaminant-sediment effects on river communities. The work will have important implications for managing agricultural aquatic ecosystems, which are some of the most threatened in Canada and worldwide.

"Neutron stars are extreme astrophysical objects, 300,000  times as massive as the Earth and yet the size of small city. They offer a unique laboratory to study matter under conditions of high density, temperature,  and magnetic fields: conditions that cannot be achieved in terrestrial laboratories. Born in the collapse of a massive star, they are also an important part of our understanding of the evolution of stars, especially the origins and evolution of their magnetic fields and rotation. We propose a program of theoretical work designed to directly address recent observations of both weakly and strongly magnetized neutron stars. The goal is to probe the extreme physics of these objects, particularly their magnetic field strength and geometry, their interior conditions, and nuclear burning properties on their surface.

"Projecting future water availability is one of the main challenges of water management. The objectives of this project are to provide data on long-term patterns in water availability from the Winnipeg River Drainage Basin (WRDB) in northwestern Ontario, a region which is heavily reliant on water resources for hydrological power generation, as well as other societal demands. In order to prepare for future extremes, long-term planning must be based on realistic estimates of historical lows in water availability. However, these long-term lows are currently only based on the 80-100 year instrumental records, which are not representative of the full range in extremes that occurred prior to the 20th century. Although many regions of Canada are projected to have increased precipitation under increasing CO2 conditions, there is great uncertainty in both the temporal and spatial distribution of future precipitation based on model projections. Empirical data from the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in the WRDB suggests that without a substantial increase in precipitation lake levels, stream flows and groundwater levels will all decline under a warmer climate. Our recent findings from the ELA, suggests that water availability has been at much lower extremes than any seen during the 20th century. Our proposed research will provide information on the spatial coverage of water availability within the WRDB over the past ~2000 years (a period influenced by climatic processes similar to today) to determine the frequency, magnitude and duration of past lows in water availability, and whether these lows have occurred synchronously across the WRDB. A more adequate assessment of the extremes in water availability will enable water managers to better prepare adaptation strategies for the future. The methods developed in this proposal will be applicable to many other regions in Canada. The three MSc students trained in this multi-disciplinary field will be able to work in a diversity of fields (e.g., science teachers, conservation authorities, park managers, environmental consulting companies, water-management positions). Highly trained personnel in environmental assessment, and particularly in water management, will continue to be in high demand.

"Cells in our bodies are continually exposed to potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a result of normal cellular metabolism and exposure to inflammatory factors called cytokines.  It is essential for cells to detect ROS levels and respond in an appropriate manner.  Recent studies in yeast and bacteria have shown that certain proteins within the cell can ""sense"" ROS by virtue of sulfur containing amino acids which can be directly oxidized by ROS and undergo a chemical linkage called a disulfide bond.  The formation of disulfide bonds leads to activation of key proteins which can then function to increase expression of genes that either participate in a protective anti-oxidant response or, if the levels of ROS are high, initiate cell death.  Emerging evidence indicates that a similar disulfide-bond controlled activation system may also occur in mammalian cells as well.  ROS, produced at the cell membrane and in specialized organelles called mitochondria, can trigger signaling events leading to altered gene expression in the nucleus.  The exact type of proteins within mitochondria and nuclei that undergo disulfide bonding in response to elevated ROS is poorly understood.  Using mouse cell culture models that mimic physiological conditions, combined with a novel protein separation technique, we will determine the spectrum of disulfide linked proteins in mitochondria and nuclei that are affected by increased ROS levels.  Initial studies have revealed that a major anti-oxidant protein can interact, via disulfide bonding, with nuclear proteins involved in development and DNA repair.  Identification and analysis of ROS sensing proteins will provide insight into how oxidative cellular conditions influence both normal and disease-associated signaling processes.

"The objective of this research program is to identify novel mechanisms by which orphan nuclear receptors control the activation and repression of genes involved in glucose metabolism.  Activation of the liver X receptor alpha (LXRa) inhibits the expression of key genes involved in glucose metabolism including the rate-limiting enzyme in glucose synthesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK).  Preliminary data from this lab have also demonstrated that the liver X receptor beta (LXRb) is required for the glucocorticoid (GC)-mediated upregulation of PEPCK, suggesting that an important and currently unrecognized molecular interplay is occurring between the nuclear receptors glucocorticoid receptor and the LXRs. The first objective will be to determine the molecular mechanism of LXRa-mediated transrepression of genes involved in glucose metabolism.  The second objective will be to identify novel mechanisms of interaction between GC and the orphan nuclear receptor LXRb in the control of glucose metabolism.  Using sophisticated technology for genomic and proteomic analysis, we will determine whether direct regulation of GC-responsive genes is occurring with LXRs or whether the effect is secondary to altered regulation of another intermediate protein.  We will determine whether or not these nuclear receptors are associated with these active promoters and where they are located in the promoter context.  This research program has the important function of identifying completely novel molecular mechanisms for GC signaling and glucose regulation with a high probability for uncovering how members of this receptor superfamily converge at the molecular level on metabolic signaling pathways. The benefit to Canada will come not only in the form of an enhanced research environment for trainees and increased visibility in the quality of research in Canada but also in the discovery of new molecular components regulating the critically important process of glucose metabolism.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Molec. & Develop.

"This proposal concerns the connection between finite simple groups and modular forms. These connections were conjectured by Conway and Norton who coined the term ""monstrous moonshine"" to describe the link between the monster sporadic simple group and modular functions and forms.



Since  their formulation  in the late 1970s, the moonshine conjectures have spawned new branches of mathematics. The work of Frenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman and Borcherds showed the deep links with mathematical physics via Vertex Algebras. Borcherds also introduced generalized Kac-Moody algebras in his proof of the moonshine conjectures.



The moonshine conjectures, and the new mathematics needed for their proof, continue to have an important impact on mathematics. It seems certain that the study of moonshine will continue to be a fruitful source of new mathematics. The proposed research program will contribute to this study through continued work on the classification and properties of congruence subgroups - particularly those of small genus. The project will use these result to study replication, Hecke operators and generalized moonshine. Recent work of Witten also suggests new connections between monstrous moonshine and physics. Part of this project will be to investigate the links between the sporadic simple groups, modular functions and mathematical physics.","Sciences math�matiques","Avancement des connaissances","Pure & Applied Maths - A",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"
"Have you ever thought of solving a problem backwards? That is, from the answer, tried to discover the question? In a general sense this is the main objective of the research program described here. Its final goal is to develop computationally efficient techniques that use all available information at the ground surface, to characterize or describe the structure and properties of an underground 'oil reservoir' (that is, porous subsurface rock in which oil and gas fluids are naturally stored). The expected amount of oil and gas that can be recovered from a particular reservoir, is directly related to its size and internal porous media properties. Thus, we can imagine the tremendous importance of knowing the reservoir shape and size, as well as its internal properties, for the overall reservoir management process. The problem is that there is no direct access to the reservoir rock. This means that the construction of this ""image"" of the reservoir is not a trivial problem. It is, in fact, an inverse problem, as mentioned above. Mathematically speaking, we describe this as an 'ill posed problem', since several solutions are equally achievable, but only one is correct.

To find the correct solution to an inverse problem, the strategy is to consider as much data as possible. For the reservoir description problem two classes of data can then be considered: static data (such as core, log, and seismic data) and the dynamic data (such as transient pressures, saturations and flow rates). At present, the majority of the available techniques only allow us to use data from limited sources. As a result, the uncertainty in reservoir properties is higher than it could be, and reservoir management cannot be optimized. The objective of the proposed research program is to develop computationally efficient techniques for generating reservoir models, which uses both static and dynamic production data. Successful development of more efficient reservoir description methodologies will provide oil operators with improved reservoir management techniques that can lead to increased oil and gas production and more efficient, less costly and environmentally safer operation.

"This proposal deals exclusively with fundamental aspects of fatty acid and ketone body (ketone) metabolism during HEALTHY human aging. As the engine behind physiological processes, energy metabolism has a major impact on two important aspects of quality of life - brain function and physical fatigue - both of which assume greater importance during aging. The brain accounts for nearly � of the energy requirements of the adult human body at rest and is a major consumer of ketones whenever glucose is less available for prolonged periods. Ketone production is dependent on fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, if there are 'obligatory' (physiological) changes in energy metabolism as humans age, we expect that fatty acid metabolism and ketone synthesis would be affected. Our goal is to develop a clearer understanding the physiology of fatty acid and ketone metabolism in the healthy elderly so as to provide a better foundation for developing more effective strategies aimed at maintaining optimal health and quality of life throughout adulthood. We carefully screen for HEALTHY elderly subjects. We use metabolic tests with stable isotope-labeled fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate, and dietary supplements or specific pharmaceuticals to safely probe fatty acid oxidation and ketone production. Though not exhaustive, our metabolic test protocols are sufficiently detailed and well established in our lab to give us confidence that we can identify changes in fatty acid or ketone metabolism that are truly related specifically to the physiology of aging, i.e. they occur in healthy individuals and are not due to accompanying disease. Power analysis based on our preliminary studies suggests that 10-12 subjects/age group are sufficient for these studies. These studies may eventually lead to recommendations for how to protect optimal energy metabolism in younger and middle-aged adults, thereby possibly protecting brain function in the elderly.

risks associated with exposure to radiation, and the risks due to inconclusive or misleading diagnoses, technical

"""Smart"" materials undergo dramatic changes in their properties in response to some change in their environment, known as a ""trigger"". The sudden switch in physical or chemical properties is useful in the design of materials used in diverse markets including electronics, health care and industrial products. Recently, the authors demonstrated that finely divided dispersions of small polymer particles (""polymer nanospheres"") in water could be rapidly aggregated to yield a mixture of clear water and polymer nanospheres. This change was triggered by simply exposing the mixture to air. The key material, known as a ""switchable surfactant"", is a special type of smart soap that ensures the polymer nanospheres remain uniformly dispersed when the surfactant is switched ""on"" (when carbon dioxide is present). However when the atmosphere of carbon dioxide is replaced by air for example, the polymer nanospheres aggregate and settle out of their suspended state. (Recycled carbon dioxide can be used, eliminating concerns of greenhouse gas emissions.) Dispersions of polymer nanospheres are widely used in many important industrial products, including latex paints, adhesives coatings and resin manufacture. In some products, it is necessary to add chemicals such as acids or salts to destabilize the dispersion. These chemicals must either be removed at a cost to the consumer, or are discharged into the environment. The use of switchable surfactants could eliminate these problems. Polymer nanospheres are also increasingly being used in specialty fields, including advanced electronics and in the biomedical area as diagnostic tools. The ability to radically alter the state of a polymer nanosphere dispersion from uniformly suspended to aggregated may provide significant economic opportunities in both emerging areas of advanced materials as well as in more traditional markets. This project would be the first application of ""switchable surfactants"" to the field of polymer nanospheres, and would create a new class of smart materials.

"This proposal concerns magnetic and superconducting crystals with exotic, symmetry-derived properties.  At high temperatures, an ordered, non-magnetic crystal possesses the following symmetries: time reversal (i.e. the crystal appears the same whether time runs forward or backwards); various discrete rotations (for example, a cubic crystal looks the same if turned by 90 degrees); and discrete translations (when viewed on an atomic scale, the crystal can be moved a tiny distance corresponding to the size of the crystal unit cell).  Time reversal symmetry is broken in magnetic crystals, which means that the direction of the magnetisation depends on the direction of time.  In addition to time reversal symmetry breaking, other symmetries may be broken as well.  In superconductors, a more complicated kind of symmetry, called gauge symmetry, is broken.  This may also be accompanied by other kinds of symmetry-breaking, including broken time reversal symmetry.

     This work has several components, covering a wide range of issues in magnetic and superconducting systems.  The first part concerns the existence of magnetism in crystals known as pyrochlores, which possess a complicated but highly symmetric structure.   These systems are described by simple theoretical models, but it turns out that the models are extremely difficult to analyse.  Part of this work will study these models using computers.  The second part concerns magneto-electric crystals: materials for which the magnetic properties can be controlled by electric fields (and vice versa).  The rest of the proposal deals with superconductors.  Experimental studies yield a great deal of information about the symmetry properties of superconductors, but the route is often indirect and heavily reliant on theoretical calculation, which this work aims to provide.  

   In each of these topics, the fundamental properties of matter, namely quantum mechanical and collective behaviour, will be investigated.  While magneto-electric materials have obvious technological applications as data storage media,  the exploitation of other unusual properties of magnetic and superconducting materials is just beginning to be explored.

"The proposed research is about the development of a novel automated manufacturing process designed to replace tedious hand-polishing operations involved in the fabrication procedures of mass production injection molds.  Injection molds are expensive pieces of equipment required to produce at reasonable price, any kind of polymer parts contained in a large variety of consumer products such as cars, computers, cell phones, electric tools, toys and others.  The main cavity of an injection mold is carved out of a block of tool steel material with a powerful CNC milling machine, followed by secondary manual processes to obtain the desired surface finish.  Up to 30% of the mold production cost is related to the latter secondary finishing processes because most of these operations involve handwork.  In the proposed research our intention is to design a automated manufacturing process, based on the ED�M electric discharge �machining and UA�M ultrasonic abrasive �machining principles.  In ED�M, electric discharges are produced between a tool and the workpiece to be polished.  Each discharge attacks the surface peeks and vaporise tiny amount of the material.  For UA�M, an ultrasonic activated tool generates powerful yet small displacement to propel abrasive particles over the surface of the workpiece which removes or displaces tiny amount of material.  The novelty of this approach resides in the possibility to combine the advantages of both processes within the same numerically controlled machine tool.  Such characteristic is made possible by the development of a ductile, electrically conductive and wear resistant polymer tool which, once compression molded can be used as a tool to perform either material removal techniques in the hardest metals.  The entire process is environmentally friendly since it is conducted in air or with abrasive particles (like sand) and does not generate toxic by-products.  Mold manufacturing represents a 3 to 4 billion dollars business in Canada, and competition from emerging countries is fierce because of lower wages.  Thus, the proposed research endeavours giving back a worldwide competitive edge to our mold manufacturing industry.

Specifically, we are interested in better constraining the temperature structure in the upper ~200 km of the Earth, as this controls the distribution of earthquakes, the generation of volcanic magmas and the strength of the plates.  This will allow a better understanding of continental evolution and natural hazards at subduction zones, including western Canada and Japan.

"    )	One of the oldest observations in ecology is that biodiversity (e.g., the number of different species) varies enormously from place to place.  Human activities very frequently affect diversity.  Consequently it would be very useful to identify the processes that control diversity, and to show how human activities influence these.  

        Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain patterns of diversity.  These include the possibility of historical legacies of evolution and dispersal, contemporary caps on diversity, and dynamic processes that increase or decrease diversity.  The purpose of this work is to derive testable predictions from these hypotheses, to test the hypotheses, and to develop improved models that predict the variation of diversity through space and through time, as functions of observable habitat characteristics.  We do this at scales ranging from the entire globe to regions such as southern Ontario.  

        We will also address applied questions such as: can species decline be predicted?  Can we determine what factors are related to successful recovery of endangered species protected under the Species at Risk Act?

        The approach I adopt is macroecological: that is, searching for patterns in large data sets that cover many different areas and many groups of species.  In studies at the global scale, experimental approach is rarely practical.  However, hypotheses about global phenomena often predict patterns that should be observed in nature, as well as how systems should respond to natural perturbations such as climate change.  I use these predicted broad-scale patterns to test global hypotheses. 

        The main impact of the proposed work is to resolve a very long-standing fundamental problem in our understanding of natural ecosystems: why are there more species in some places than others?  However, this work has applied impacts as well.  If we can identify the factors that control biodiversity, then we can assess how human activities affect those factors, and thus biodiversity.  Ultimately, the goal of my work is to be able to predict how human activities will affect the distribution of diversity on Earth.

"Conserving biodiversity and using biological resources in a sustainable manner has gained international prominence in the wake of the Convention on Biological Diversity.  In order to meet Canada's obligations to the Rio Convention, the Standing Committee on Environment concluded that one of the fundamental goals of the Canadian Government should be to establishment of a National Inventory of Canada's biological diversity.  The Committee further recommended that Canada support the creation of an international data bank of world species.  As the documentation of biological diversity follows largely within the domain of systematic biologists, it is important that Canada's systematics infrastructure be maintained and enhanced.  Aquatic insects command a high priority because of their importance in freshwater food chains and utility as indicators of water quality.  They also include among the most important vectors of disease to humans and other animals.



My research- and training program on the Systematics and Comparative Biology of Aquatic Insects is intended to benefit from the complimentary strengths of the University of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM).  The research component focuses on my on-going investigations into the systematics of black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae).  Building on the foundation provided by my book The Black Flies of North America, research will concentrate on the least known area in North America in terms of its insect fauna -- the Canadian Arctic.  I will also use cutting edge microsatellite data to test a model of black fly speciation based on chromosomal evolution. Thirdly, I will address several outstanding problems in black fly phylogeny, which will provide a sounder base from which to make interpretations about character evolution and biogeography.  Finally, my research program will shed valuable new insights about northern black flies and their parasitic diseases on northern vertebrates.

"The proposed research project will involve non-intrusive experiments to measure the velocity distribution in slow viscous flows. The fluid will be viscoelastic and the flow regime will be a porous medium as represented by arrays of cylindrical rods. The changing flow area in such a configuration constantly squeezes and stretches the fluid, and in the case of viscoelastic fluids this leads to a constant stretching and relaxation of the fluid molecules. Under certain circumstances this, in turn, leads to an elastic instability of the flow, and it is the details of such instabilities that form the basic focus of the proposed research.



We have developed a basic test facility for such experiments. The facility incorporates a gravity-driven vertical flow field that contains the appropriate model test section. All components of the facility and the models are made of clear acrylic which permits the use of optical measuring techniques. We propose to use Particle Image Velocimetry and the fluids involved will be highly viscous Boger fluids which maintain a constant viscosity while allowing variations of their elasticity.



Common applications of the type of flows being considered include manufacturing processes where liquid resins are injected into a dry preform of reinforcing fibers.  Textile coating is another area of application involving such products as shoes, handbags, artificial leather, tarpaulins, and automobile air bags.  Another area of application relates to oil recovery where aqueous polymer solutions are pumped into crude oil reservoirs in sedimentary rock.  The human body contains many areas where viscoelastic liquids encounter porous media.  One such example involves the nasal cavity in which mucous flows past the cilia, thus trapping dust that enters the cavity with the air.

"Gas chromatography (GC) is used in industry and academic research to identify each component and its

amount in a sample containing possibly hundreds of compounds. The power of GC is that this information is

obtained in a single application and therefore plays a major role in pharmaceutical quality assurance/quality

control, environmental regulatory enforcement and compliance, food safety analysis, forensics, homeland

security, and hydrocarbon processing industries.



The project will focus on making GC analyses faster and, at the same time, provide the ability to report the

concentration of compounds that are present over a very wide range. Current technology is incapable of

achieving this. Our technology will enable new approaches to the practice of chromatography in the typical

analytical laboratory and will have major impact in two areas.



The first is for process GC used as online analyzers. The enhanced capacity and fast analysis will allow a

process stream to be monitored using a simple direct injection procedure to ensure that the process is in control

in a timely manner.



The second is for a portable handheld GC. Our new GC column technology, which will be refined under this

proposal, includes a novel heating device to maintain components in the gas phase for separation. This reduces

the size of the GC so that it can be easily handled in the field for environmental studies and where homeland

security issues require rapid analysis to protect the health of citizens.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","RPP Internal Decision Cttee","1 & 2","I2IPJ ","Idea to Innovation",Alberta,Alberta

"We are requesting funding for molecular biology equipment to measure gene transcripts and proteins in organisms (e.g. fish, insects, phytoplankton, fungi, cyanobacteria) experiencing environmental stress.  These instruments will be used as shared inter-departmental resources at Mount Allison University and would be used regularly by at least six active research groups in three science departments (Biology, Biochemistry/Chemistry and Environmental Science).  Collectively, the research supported by this equipment is important because it will allow us to understand how aquatic ecosystems are affected by and respond to a changing, often stressful environment.  We have an integrative approach to this work with experiments rooted in genetics, biochemistry, physiology and oceanography.  The environmental issues of climate change and pollution are national priorities. This infrastructure is important for Canada because it will facilitate the development of both independent and collaborative research programs addressing regional and national problems associated with aquatic stresses. These facilities will significantly enhance the University's training capacity, leading to a workforce well-equipped to tackle topics in environmental stress at the molecular level.

"My research program is targeted at understanding the molecular and physiological processes used by aquatic animals to survive in changing, often stressful environments.  Daily and seasonal fluctuations in temperature and oxygen pose particular problems for fish because their body conditions change with the environment.  The nature of my proposed research is to evaluate how primary reactions to environmental stress at the level of the whole animal, such as changes in metabolism and hormones, interact with stress-induced changes in genes and proteins to facilitate stress tolerance.  I intend to use the powerful molecular biology technology of short interference RNA (siRNA) on fish blood cells to 'knock down' the expression of specific stress-induced genes.  This will provide fish physiologists with a cutting edge research tool to study the functional significance of many proteins. The use of blood as a tissue to assess stress is noteworthy as it provides a means to non-terminally sample fish in the wild. As global temperatures increase, knowledge of the molecular and physiological mechanisms underpinning the capacity of fish to maintain key biological functions, will help to make informed predictions regarding the impact of climate change on aquatic populations and ecosystems.  Given the decline of fish stocks in Canada and worldwide, this insight is of great economic as well as scientific interest.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Integrative Animal Biology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","New Brunswick",Nouveau-Brunswick
"A radix representation for an n-dimensional vector is analogous to our usual positional, representations of real numbers, such as base 10 or base 2.  In the standard base 10 representation, a number, such as 567, has a ones digit (7), a tens digit (6), and hundreds digit (5), and so on.  This means that 567 is equal to 7 times 1, plus 6 times 10, plus 5 times 100.  Each of these places comes from a power of 10 (1 is 10 raised to the power 0, 10 is 10 raised to the power 1, and 100 is 10 raised to the power 2).  Thus 10 is called the base, also known as the radix.  The digits are chosen from a given set.  For example, in the standard base 10 representation, digits can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  In the standard base 2 representation, digits can be 0 or 1.  In higher dimensions, the base (radix) is an expanding matrix, A, and the digits are vectors instead of numbers.  We still have an A to the power 0 digit, an A to the power 1 digit, an A to the power 2, and so on.  Now, however, when we take a sum of powers of the base times digits, we get vectors instead of numbers.



This representation ties together two exciting new areas of mathematics: wavelet theory and fractals.  Wavelet theory is concerned with the decomposition of functions or signals to different levels of resolution, or scales, and has many applications in signal processing, data compression, digital image analysis, and related fields.  Many fractals are generated by applying the same set of functions repeatedly, which gives them the well-known property of self-similarity at different scales.  Fractals can be used to model a variety of natural phenomena, and can also be used in applications such as digital image analysis.  Both wavelet theory and fractals study mathematical objects (functions or sets) that exhibit self-similarity at different scales, and radix representations helps us study these areas by breaking vectors or numbers down by scale (the ones level, the tens level, and so on).  In bringing together these two different areas of mathematics, we will use what is known about one topic to learn more about each of the other topics.

"The overall objective of my NSERC research program is to elucidate changes in the profiles of the minor components of selected oils and fats that occur as a result of agricultural practices, oil extraction and refining, food processing or environmental processes.  There is a trend to alter natural lipid profiles in order to modify functionality and hence find new applications for abundant sources of oils and fats. This occurs in crops and livestock as a result of breeding and agricultural practices used to impart desirable traits. Subsequent processing may either deliberately alter lipid profiles (e.g. by hydrogenation) or do so as a by-product of oil extraction and refining. Pre- and post-harvest processes that alter overall lipid profiles inevitably affect minor lipid components, which may be biologically or functionally significant. Since food lipids form the basis of valuable global industries, much has been learned about the bulk composition of these commodities. In contrast, present knowledge of the trace components of lipids does not always match the achievable limits of modern analytical chemistry.

In this research, sensitive and specific analytical techniques with the ability to differentiate structural similar compounds present at low levels in bulk oils and fats will be developed. ""Multi-dimensional"" analytical methods, which provide enhanced ability to separate and detect compounds in complex mixtures via the coupling of two or more distinct techniques, will be employed. These include two-dimensional gas or liquid chromatography (GC or LC) and multi-stage mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and further dimensions added by selective ionization methods, combined chromatography-MS/MS, and structurally specific GC and LC detectors. Particular emphasis will be given to incorporating the technique of atmospheric pressure photoionisation (APPI) mass spectrometry which shows great promise in lipid analyses. Ultimately, multidimensional instrumental analytical methods will be used to discover and investigate changes in the minor components in food oils which cannot be observed in current lipid analyses.

"The disruption of hormone functions has long been viewed as a promising avenue for the development of insect-specific, environmentally friendly pest control products. One such hormone, ""juvenile hormone"" (JH), plays critical roles in insect development and reproduction. Inhibition of its biosynthesis during larval development can trigger the premature - and typically fatal - transformation into the adult form (i.e., metamorphosis), while a similar inhibition in adults can suppress reproduction. JH is a terpenoid compound whose biosynthesis involves some late-step, insect-specific enzymes as well as several other enzymes that, in other organisms, are involved in the production of common metabolites such as cholesterol. Among the latter group of enzymes, we identified one that displays features apparently unique to a group of insects known as the Lepidoptera (caterpillars, moths, butterflies). This lepidopteran enzyme, farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), displays selectivity for ethyl-substituted substrates, which are the precursors of the unusual JHs molecules found in these insects; the lepidopeteran JHs differ from those observed in other taxa in that their carbon skeletons bear ethyl branches rarely seen in related compounds of this family. The proposed research focuses on the characterization of the lepidopteran version of this enzyme, including (i) the identification of its active form, (ii) the study of its precise roles in JH biosynthesis and other metabolic pathways, and (iii) the identification of the structural features that confer selectivity for homologous substrates. The knowledge generated through this research is expected to pave the way to the rational design of FPPS inhibitors that specifically target the Lepidoptera; such compounds could form the basis of novel, target-specific pest control products.

"Since their inception, the toxicological sciences have generally been guided by the tenet that there is a dose-response threshold above which chemical exposures induce a biological effect, and below which none occurs.  Although this principle has been a cornerstone of all facets of toxicology and has been invaluable for establishment of harmful exposure limits and effective doses of chemicals, there is now very strong support for the occurrence of hormesis, chemical response characterized by low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition of biological effects.  Hormesis (after the Greek word 'to excite') has been documented for a wide range of organisms, endpoints and physical/chemical stressors, and has garnered interest from researchers in a variety of disciplines, mainly those who study human risk assessment and the biomedical sciences (e.g. oncology and the study of aging).  However, the phenomenon has been less studied by scientists who examine effects of environmental toxins on invertebrate populations, particularly over the long term.  

     Insects often display rapid and prolific reproduction, and are subject to exposure to a wide array of synthetic chemicals.  This is especially true in agricultural settings where intense chemical inputs are commonplace.  The proposed research will test hypotheses that exposure to toxic chemicals at low doses can have hormetic effects on insects.  Numerous endpoints will be assessed to determine which display hormetic responses, and how these contribute to population growth stimulation.  Experiments will determine dose-time-response relationships for individuals and across generations, and whether hormesis is consistent among different insect taxa and populations.  Additional studies will elucidate the biochemical mechanisms for stimulated reproduction (e.g. elevated levels of metabolic enzymes) and examine properties of hormesis in chemical mixtures. These studies will advance our basic toxicological knowledge of the effects of low-dose chemical exposures on insects, with implications for environmental risk assessment, design of experiments to test hormesis, insect pest management and environmental toxicology.

"There are a variety of learned actions, such as lacing shoes, writing words with a pencil, riding a bicycle and driving a car that make our lives more efficient. When we learn a new action, we pay full attention to carrying it out; but after repeating it, the action becomes nearly automatic. Despite the significance of motor learning for the performance of most behaviors, little is known as to how skilled movement is encoded by the brain and how aging is affecting this ability. For instance, whereas motor memory is preserved with advanced age, the ability to acquire new motor skills is significantly slower. As a new appointed professor in the department of Chemistry-Biology at the Universit� du Qu�bec � Trois-Rivi�res, I am interested to expand our understanding on the mechanisms regulating the nature and dynamics of the plastic changes occurring during the learning of a motor task. One aspect of my previous work completed during a post-doctoral training at Duke University (NC) has raised the interesting possibility that molecules known to be implicated on memory processes, such as members of the synaptic-associated proteins, might also play a role in motor skill learning. This research program will investigate (1) the synaptic densities and (2) the expression levels of candidate synapse-associated proteins in the brain of mice at different age during motor skill learning. In addition, (3) we will delineate the specific genes implicated in this condition using a robust modern technique, the DNA microarray analysis.  As synapses have over 1000 protein components, a better understanding of these protein interactions, organization and functions will lead to a global view of the role of synapses in the control and the learning of motor behaviors, and neurophysiology in general.","Avancement des connaissances","Avancement des connaissances","Integrative Animal Biology",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"My research interests are in building a quantitative understanding of the process of cell division 

with a focus on the dynamics and mechanics of biopolymers. These biopolymers are essential for generating the forces required to segregate chromosomes and to physically divide the cell in half. Until recently, I have concentrated on eukaryotic cell division (Drosophila early embryos) and related questions involving microtubule (MT) organization. I intend to continue this line of research extending it to analysis of MT-based processes in plant cells. In addition, as a natural extension to this focus on eukaryotic cell division, I have more recently engaged in modeling bacterial cell division. Although bacterial cells are distant relatives of eukaryotes and carry out cell division in ways that differ in the details, the basic physical problems are the similar and depend on the dynamics and mechanics of similar biopolymers. 



I intend to approach these questions using a combination of mathematical modeling and experiment. Through this combination, I hope to delve into the analysis of mechanisms with a greater degree of quantitative detail than usually employed in purely experimental approaches and thereby refine our understanding of these mechanisms.

"The goal of this research is to precisely predict properties of subatomic systems that are also studied experimentally.  Comparisons of theoretical and measured values test our understanding of fundamental interactions, accurately determine physical constants, and will ultimately lead to the discovery of new phenomena.

In order to accomplish these goals, my group combines methods of theoretical physics with those of computing science and mathematics.  We develop algorithms to enable computers to tackle large algebraic expressions, and use clusters of computers to solve huge systems of equations.  We also use numerical methods to reveal the structure of simple atoms.  

At present we focus on the interplay of strong- and weak-interactions in the heavy quark production and decays,  on the dynamics of one- and few-electron atoms, and on a variety of ""new physics"" probes involving muons and neutrons. 

Our projects have already improved the knowledge of fundamental parameters such as the electron mass, muon and electron magnetic moment, lifetimes of heavy quarks and elements of the matrix describing transitions among various types of quarks.  The proposed research will increase the accuracy of the fine structure constant and deepen our understanding of the behavior of fundamental constituents of matter.  

This research provides an excellent opportunity to train students.  They are exposed to a broad range of physical systems, from high-energy heavy quark processes to low-energy particles in traps, and learn to determine their relevant features such as characteristic energy scales.  They learn sophisticated programming skills, useful also outside academia.  Since most of our projects are completed in collaboration with international groups, students develop a global network of contacts and gain experience working with researchers from other regions, ranging from Japan and Vietnam to Western Europe and Russia.

"Software evolution is one of the key challenges in software development and the proposed research will result in a tool-supported method that will significantly simplify the evolution of framework-based software. The proposed research builds on our previous work on framework-specific modeling languages (FSMLs) with support for round-trip engineering. A FSML is a special kind of a domain-specific modeling language (DSL) that was designed to represent a set of concepts provided by a framework. The first objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate that FSMLs with round-trip engineering can effectively reduce the effort of evolving framework-based software. The second objective is to demonstrate that the effort of building such FSMLs can be reduced by mining for them in existing framework-based application code. The key novelties include demonstrating the feasibility of (1) effective round-trip engineering between domain-specific models and code and (2) mining application code for DSLs. The research will be carried out in collaboration with IBM Labs in Toronto and Ottawa. The results will be of interest to IBM's flagship development tools, Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software and Rational Software Architect. Both tools are developed mainly in the two labs of IBM Canada. The project will also result in a prototype implementation of tools supporting the developed method. Since these tools will be available as open-source software in the Eclipse environment, other Canadian companies will be able to easily use and benefit from the results. Finally, the project will contribute to the training of 8 highly-qualified personnel at the graduate level, and 9 highly-qualified personnel at the undergraduate level. These personnel will become professionals, teachers, researchers, and entrepreneurs, contributing to the growth of the knowledge-intensive sectors of the Canadian economy.","Syst�mes d'information et technologie de l'information","Services d'information et de t�l�communications","RPP Internal Decision Cttee",2,"CRDPJ ","Collaborative Research and Development Grants",Ontario,Ontario

"Despite important advances in software methods and technology, such as object-orientation, the progress in software reusability, evolvability, and reliability has fallen short of expectations. Evolving software to conform to a changed set of requirements is notoriously hard because developers have to work with low-level code in order to perform changes. Modeling has the potential to address the evolution problem by providing just the right view in order to express the desired change precisely. Unfortunately, in the current software engineering practice, analysis and design models are just documentation artifacts, meaning that the actual change to a software system still has to be performed manually in the program code. The long-term goal is to realize the potential of modeling to address the software evolution challenge by simplifying the task of providing adequate models and keeping the models and the code consistent. The resulting methods and tools will be tested in industrial context, including banking software at Scotiabank and e-commerce software at IBM. The anticipated long-term impact of this research includes increased adoption of modeling in industry, a more direct involvement of stakeholders who are not software engineers (e.g., business analysts, scientists, and control engineers being enabled to create models that can be translated into software with less help from software developers and fewer bugs that might result from miscommunication than today), and significant productivity and quality improvements in software development through more effective evolution. Effective modeling has the benefit of adding clarity to the communication of software requirements and software architecture in a global sourcing context, where software analysts, architects, and integrators can better communicate with globally distributed developers.

"The membrane-trafficking system is a key characteristic of eukaryotes (humans, plants, yeast, etc.) and one of the defining features that separates us from bacteria at a cellular level. It is responsible for the proper movement and final location of most of the material in our cells. It underlies not only brain activity, and hormone secretion in humans, but healthy plant growth, as well as normal cellular activity in a diverse array of single-celled organisms important for our economy and environment. Our understanding of how this cellular system works is derived from a small sample of experimental organisms: our understanding of how it evolved is only beginning to be explored. Nonetheless, evidence suggests that the membrane-trafficking system arose early-on in eukaryotic evolution, with the major protein families involved likely already having been present in our ancestors over one billion years ago. Detailed studies of individual protein families, particularly in the endocytic (uptake) arm of the pathway, are revealing information about specific events and mechanisms of how this cellular machinery evolved.



The work in this application aims to examine the evolution and conservation of the secretory (export) arm of the membrane-trafficking pathway through genome sequencing of organisms that represent important gaps in our sampling, as well as through comparative bioinformatic analyses. These studies will identify what protein machinery is universal to eukaryotic cells and can validly be included in models of membrane-trafficking function. They will also uncover details of the timing and mechanisms of evolution in the secretory system and how this fits into our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic cell biology in general.

"The proposed research lies in the broad mathematical area known as analysis.  More specifically, it concerns harmonic analysis and its application to partial differential equations and several complex variables.  In particular, I am interested in developing and using the theory of Hardy spaces and related function spaces.  

     Classical harmonic analysis is an old field of mathematics, dating back to the time of Fourier and his contemporaries, who, in the early 1800's, used trigonometric series (i.e. expansion in terms of ""harmonics"", a term coming from music) to solve such physical problems as the conduction of heat and the position of a vibrating string.  These processes are governed by what is known as partial differential equations.  While harmonic analysis has undergone a major modernization in the 20th century, following the development of Lebesgue integration and the theory of functional analysis (related to the ideas of quantum mechanics in physics), it has always been motivated by the same problem, namely the decomposition of a ""signal"", given as a mathematical function, into some basic components, and the reconstruction of that signal given those components.  In fact, the widespread use of wavelets today in such applications as the storage of fingerprints is an example of the concrete nature of harmonic analysis.

     Function spaces provide a way of measuring various features of functions (representing, for example, signals or the solutions of a differential equation) and grouping them according to these features.  Being able to prove that for a certain type of input, the output of a process (a transform or operator solving a differential equation, for example) lies in a certain function space provides control of the process.  Developing the right kind of function spaces to measure desired properties is therefore of great importance.

      The significance of this proposal lies in furthering the understanding of the existing theory of Hardy spaces and BMO and its applications to partial differential equations, as well as in the introduction of new types of function spaces which can provide finer tools for these applications.","Sciences math�matiques","Avancement des connaissances","Pure & Applied Maths - A",3,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual","Qu�bec","Qu�bec"

"The electronic revolution started in the late 1960s has already profoundly impacted our daily lives both at home and in the office. Online electronic services are now intensively used for communications (wired and wireless telephone, text messaging, voice and video over IP), shopping, entertainment (multiplayer games) and information gathering. This revolution is accelerating and reaching much farther than anticipated. New services now include online third and fourth generation mobile devices acting as telephone, Internet gateway, music player, camera and geographical navigation system.



All these new services rely on an increasingly sophisticated infrastructure composed of powerful servers with numerous clients taking the form of desktop or mobile devices, and more importantly the system and networking software. Computer central processing units have evolved from simple processors to multi-core systems. Finding performance, timing or functional problems, or detecting security breaches, is increasingly difficult with these sophisticated high performance networked systems. Because suitably fast and accurate tracing and monitoring tools are not available, this results in longer development cycles, operations and maintenance support nightmares, or poorly optimized systems.



The aim of this project is to develop techniques and algorithms to provide a suitable software achitecture for low overhead tracing and monitoring tools for these complex distributed multi-core systems. The tools will enable operators to trace the complete software stack, from hypervisor to operating system, virtual execution engine and user applications. Sophisticated trace analysis tools will detect patterns of faulty behavior, and associate the trace events to a model of the computer system or service in order to explain how the total execution time is spent.

"The society increasingly relies on sophisticated computer systems for numerous applications from search engines (e.g. google.com, yahoo.com) to geographical information systems (e.g. maps.google.com), eCommerce systems and handheld music and video players. Such systems have stringent performance requirements either because of the volume of data, the number of simultaneous users or real-time  constraints. Yet, achieving the desired level of performance assumes  proper interaction between several software programs, the operating system and often several networked computers.



The objective of the proposed research program is to develop tools and techniques for highly accurate and low disturbance system level performance analysis of uniprocessor, multiprocessor and distributed systems. This is particularly challenging with newer computer systems using multiple processors, with dynamically changing clock frequency, multi-threaded preemptive operating systems (e.g. Linux with preemption) and multiple virtual machines running over an hypervisor (e.g. Xen).



The proposed system uses source code instrumentation at the operating system and user level in order to gather a detailed and precise trace of significant events. The instrumentation needs to have a minimal impact on both overall performance and on events ordering (scheduling). Special purpose analysis and viewing modules will be developed to study the performance of different subsystems (memory, disk I/O, networking...). Collaboration is already under way with industrial partners faced with very demanding applications. These industrial partners will provide both real life sample applications needing sophisticated performance analysis tools, and feedback on the efficiency, accuracy and applicability of the proposed algorithms, techiques and tools.

"A key characteristic of animals is their capacity to produce external cutaneous coloration, which is essential for survival, social communication, and protection against damage from solar UV radiation. In mammals, coloration develops through production of melanins by cells called melanocytes, and its transfer to other skin cells termed keratinocytes. The processes whereby melanin is taken up by keratinocytes are not known. We have identified a protein called integrin-linked kinase (ILK) as one of the factors necessary for melanin uptake. Our research will determine how ILK functions during melanin uptake, and how alterations in ILK result in defective melanin transfer and skin or hair coloration.","Sciences de la vie (y compris biotechnologie)","Avancement des connaissances","Cell Biology",2,"RGPIN ","Discovery Grants Program - Individual",Ontario,Ontario

"Le monde des communications est pr�sentement � un carrefour tr�s important de son �volution. Les secteurs de la communication sans fil et de la communication mobile constituent en ce sens des d�fis importants. Ce programme de recherche interviendra dans les domaines du traitement des signaux et mise en oeuvre des syst�mes de communication sans fil de quatri�me g�n�ration (4G) employant plusieurs antennes � l'�mission et plusieurs antennes � la r�ception (MIMO - Multiple Input Multiple Output). Le choix des syst�mes MIMO est justifi� par la qu�te des syst�mes sans fil d'atteindre les performances des syst�mes filaires en termes de d�bits tout en assurant de grandes capacit� et efficacit� spectrale.

"The intricate processes that allow biological organisms to function can be studied at the cellular and sub-cellular level.  The membrane bilayer is the fatty layer that surrounds the cell and is host to a variety of proteins that are able to regulate cell function. The bilayer acts as the gatekeeper to the passage of molecules from the outside to the inside of the cell.  Therefore, the cell membrane provides a physical shield protecting the internal environment crucial for cellular function and facilitates communication required for the survival of an individual cell or organism in response to its environment. Certain organisms, such as plants and fungi, have an additional cell wall composed of sugar polymers that provide structural reinforcement to resist internal turgor pressure and maintain freestanding growth.  Both cell membranes and cell walls are interfaces with unique chemistry and physical properties for any given cell type. It is these interfaces in a variety of contexts that are the focus of this proposal. 



For the many proteins within the cell membrane, their spatial organization and local environment are thought to directly affect their function.  Further, these proteins are proposed to help drive cell membrane organization into discrete packets called ""microdomains"". Therefore, we will study the effect of different membrane associated proteins and their effector molecules on the structure of cell membranes either mounted on solid supports or within whole live cells. Further, we will characterize cells by simultaneously probing their surface chemistry, topography and physical properties, allowing us to track cellular changes in response to external stimuli. My research tools offer a unique perspective that will contribute to fundamental knowledge about cellular function. Eventually the research will help elucidate mechanisms at this interface and provide a link between detailed molecular studies and clinical observations.
